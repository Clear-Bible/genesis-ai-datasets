Chapter 1

   1:1 And Timothy [kai Timotheos]. Timothy is with Paul, having been sent
   on to Macedonia from Ephesus (Ac 19:22). He is in no sense co-author
   any more than Sosthenes was in 1Co 1:1. In all Achaia [en holei tei
   Achaiai]. The Romans divided Greece into two provinces (Achaia and
   Macedonia). Macedonia included also Illyricum, Epirus, and Thessaly.
   Achaia was all of Greece south of this (both Attica and the
   Peloponnesus). The restored Corinth was made the capital of Achaia
   where the pro-consul resided (Ac 18:12). He does not mention other
   churches in Achaia outside of the one in Corinth, but only "saints"
   [hagiois]. Athens was in Achaia, but it is not clear that there was as
   yet a church there, though some converts had been won (Ac 17:34), and
   there was a church in Cenchreae, the eastern port of Corinth (Ro 16:1).
   Paul in 2Co 9:2 speaks of Achaia and Macedonia together. His language
   here would seem to cover the whole [holei], all) of Achaia in his scope
   and not merely the environment around Corinth.

   1:2 Identical with 1Co 1:3 which see.

   1:3 Blessed [eulogetos]. From old verb [eulogeO], to speak well of, but
   late verbal in LXX and Philo. Used of men in Ge 24:31, but only of God
   in N.T. as in Lu 1:68 and chiefly in Paul (2Co 11:31; Ro 1:25). Paul
   has no thanksgiving or prayer as in 1Co 1:4-9, but he finds his basis
   for gratitude in God, not in them. The God and Father [ho theos kai
   pater]. So rightly, only one article with both substantives as in 2Pe
   1:1. Paul gives the deity of Jesus Christ as our Lord [Kuriou], but he
   does not hesitate to use the language here as it occurs. See 1Pe 1:3;
   Eph 1:3 where the language is identical with that here. The father of
   mercies [ho pater tOn oiktirmOn] and God of all comfort [kai theos
   pases parakleseOs]. Paul adds an item to each word. He is the
   compassionate Father characterized by mercies [oiktirmOn], old word
   from [oikteirO], to pity, and here in plural, emotions and acts of
   pity). He is the God of all comfort [parakleseOs], old word from
   [parakaleO], to call to one's side, common with Paul). Paul has already
   used it of God who gave eternal comfort (2Th 2:16). The English word
   comfort is from the Latin confortis (brave together). The word used by
   Jesus of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter or Paraklete is this very
   word (Joh 14:16; 16:7). Paul makes rich use of the verb [parakaleO] and
   the substantive [paraklesis] in this passage (3-7). He urges all
   sorrowing and troubled hearts to find strength in God.

   1:4 In all our affliction [epi pasei tei thlipsei hemOn]. [Thlipsis] is
   from [thlibO], to press, old and common word, as tribulation is from
   Latin tribulum (roller). See on Mt 13:21 and 1Th 1:6. The English
   affliction is Latin afflictio from ad-fligere, to strike on. That we
   may be able to comfort [eis to dunasthai hemas parakalein]. Purpose
   clause with [eis] and the articular infinitive with the accusative of
   general reference, a common idiom. Paul here gives the purpose of
   affliction in the preacher's life, in any Christian's life, to qualify
   him for ministry to others. Otherwise it will be professional and
   perfunctory. Wherewith [hes]. Genitive case of the relative attracted
   to that of the antecedent [parakleseOs]. The case of the relative here
   could have been either the accusative [hen] with the passive verb
   retained as in Mr 10:38 or the instrumental [hei]. Either is perfectly
   good Greek (cf. Eph 1:6; 4:1). Personal experience of God's comfort is
   necessary before we can pass it on to others.

   1:5 The sufferings of Christ [ta pathemata tou Christou]. Subjective
   genitive, Christ's own sufferings. Abound unto us [perisseuei eis
   hemas]. Overflow unto us so that we suffer like sufferings and become
   fellow sufferers with Christ (4:10f.; Ro 8:17; Php 3:10; Col 1:24).
   Through Christ [dia tou Christou]. The overflow [perisseuei] of comfort
   comes also through Christ. Is Paul thinking of how some of the Jewish
   Christians in Corinth have become reconciled with him through Christ?
   Partnership with Christ in suffering brings partnership in glory also
   (Ro 8:17; 1Pe 4:13).

   1:6 Whether [eite] --or [eite]. The alternatives in Paul's experience
   (afflicted [thlibometha], comforted [parakaloumetha] work out for their
   good when they are called on to endure like sufferings "which we also
   suffer" [hOn kai hemeis paschomen]. The relative [hOn] is attracted
   from neuter accusative plural [ha] to genitive case of the antecedent
   [pathematOn] (sufferings).

   1:7 Our hope for you [he elpis hemOn huper humOn]. The old word
   [elpis], from [elpizO], to hope, has the idea of waiting with
   expectation and patience. So here it is "steadfast" [bebaia], stable,
   fast, from [bainO], to plant the feet down). Partakers [koinOnoi].
   Partners as in Lu 5:10.

   1:8 Concerning our affliction [huper tes thlipseOs hemOn]. Manuscripts
   read also [peri] for in the Koine [huper] (over) often has the idea of
   [peri] (around). Paul has laid down his philosophy of afflictions and
   now he cites a specific illustration in his own recent experience. In
   Asia [en Asiai]. Probably in Ephesus, but what it was we do not know
   whether sickness or peril. We do know that the disciples and the
   Asiarchs would not allow Paul to face the mob in the amphitheatre
   gathered by Demetrius (Ac 20:30f.). In Ro 16:4 Paul says that Prisca
   and Aquila laid down their necks for him, risked their very lives for
   him. It may have been a later plot to kill Paul that hastened his
   departure from Ephesus (Ac 20:1). He had a trial so great that "we were
   weighed down exceedingly beyond our power" [kath' huperbolen huper
   dunamin ebarethemen]. Old verb from [baros], weight, [barus], weighty.
   First aorist passive indicative. See on 1Co 12:31 for [kath'
   huperbolen] (cf. our hyperbole). It was beyond Paul's power to endure
   if left to himself. Insomuch that we despaired even of life [hOste
   exaporethenai hemas kai tou zein]. Usual clause of result with [hOste]
   and the infinitive. First aorist passive infinitive [exaporethenai],
   late compound for utter despair (perfective use of [ex] and at a
   complete loss, [a] privative and [poros], way). There seemed no way
   out. Of life [tou zein]. Ablative case of the articular infinitive, of
   living.

   1:9 Yea [alla]. Confirmatory use as in 7:11, rather than adversative.
   The answer of death [to apokrima tou thanatou] This late word from
   [apokrinomai], to reply, occurs nowhere else in N.T., but is in
   Josephus, Polybius, inscriptions and papyri (Deissmann, Bible Studies,
   p. 257; Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary), and always in the sense of
   decision or judgment rendered. But Vulgate renders it by responsum and
   that idea suits best here, unless Paul conceives God as rendering the
   decision of death. We ourselves have had within ourselves [autoi en
   heautois eschekamen]. Regular perfect of [echO], to have. And still
   have the vivid recollection of that experience. For this lively
   dramatic use of the present perfect indicative for a past experience
   see also [escheka] in 2:13 (Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 143f.; Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 896f.). That we should not trust in ourselves [hina me
   pepoithotes Omen eph' heautois]. A further purpose of God in affliction
   beyond that in verse 4. "This dreadful trial was sent to him in order
   to give him a precious spiritual lesson (12:7-10)" (Robertson and
   Plummer). Note periphrastic perfect active subjunctive of [peithO], to
   persuade. In [epi], upon, both ourselves and God.

   1:10 Out of so great a death [ek telikoutou thanatou]. He had
   considered himself as good as dead. Delivered [erusato] --will deliver
   [rusetai]. Old verb [ruO], middle, [ruomai], draw oneself, as out of a
   pit, rescue. So Paul faces death without fear. On whom we have set our
   hope [eis hon elpikamen]. Perfect active indicative of [elpizO]. We
   still have that hope, emphasized by [eti rusetai] (he will still
   deliver).

   1:11 Ye also helping together on our behalf [sunupourgountOn kai humOn
   huper hemOn]. Genitive absolute with present active participle of late
   compound verb [sun] and [hupourgeO] for [hupo] and [ergon]. Paul relied
   on God and felt the need of the prayer of God's people. By means of
   many [ek pollOn prosOpOn]. [ProsOpon] means face [pros, ops]. The word
   is common in all Greek. The papyri use it for face, appearance, person.
   It occurs twelve times in II Corinthians. It certainly means face in
   eight of them (3:7, 13, 18; 8:24; 10:1, 7; 11:20). In 5:12 it means
   outward appearance. It may mean face or person here, 2:10; 4:6. It is
   more pictorial to take it here as face "that out of many upturned
   faces" thanks may be given [hina--eucharistethei] first aorist passive
   subjunctive) for the gift to us by means of many [dia pollon]. It is
   indeed a difficult sentence to understand.

   1:12 Glorying [kauchesis]. Act of glorying, while in verse 14
   [kauchema] is the thing boasted of. The testimony of our conscience [to
   marturion tes suneideseOs hemOn]. In apposition with [kauchesis].
   Sincerity of God [eilikrineiai tou theou]. Like [dikaiosune theou] (Ro
   1:17; 3:21), the God-kind of righteousness. So the God-kind (genitive
   case) of sincerity. Late word from [eilikrines]. See on 1Co 5:8. Not in
   fleshly wisdom [ouk en sophiai sarkikei]. See on 1Co 1:17; 2:4, 13f.
   Paul uses [sarkikos] five times and it occurs only twice elsewhere in
   N.T. See on 1Co 3:3. We behaved ourselves [anestraphemen]. Second
   aorist passive indicative of [anastrephO], old verb, to turn back, to
   turn back and forth, to walk. Here the passive is used as in late Greek
   as if middle. More abundantly to you-ward [perissoterOs pros humas].
   They had more abundant opportunity to observe how scrupulous Paul was
   (Ac 18:11).

   1:13 Than what ye read [all' e ha anaginOskete]. Note comparative
   conjunction [e] (than) after [all'] and that after [alla] (other
   things, same word in reality), "other than." Read in Greek [anaginOskO]
   is knowing again, recognizing. See on Ac 8:30. Or even acknowledge [e
   kai epiginOskete]. Paul is fond of such a play on words [anaginOskete,
   epiginOskete] or paronomasia. Does he mean "read between the lines," as
   we say, by the use of [epi] (additional knowledge)? Unto the end [heOs
   telous]. The report of Titus showed that the majority now at last
   understood Paul. He hopes that it will last (1Co 1:8).

   1:14 As also ye did acknowledge us in part [kathOs kai epegnOte hemas
   apo merous]. Gracious acknowledgment (second aorist active indicative
   of [epignOskO] to the original Pauline party (1Co 1:12; 3:4) that he
   had seemed to care so little for them. And now in his hour of victory
   he shows that, if he is their ground of glorying, they are his also
   (cf. 1Th 2:19f.; Php 2:16).

   1:15 Confidence [pepoithesei]. This late word (LXX Philo, Josephus) is
   condemned by the Atticists, but Paul uses it a half dozen times (3:4
   also). I was minded to come [eboulomen elthein]. Imperfect, I was
   wishing to come, picturing his former state of mind. Before unto you
   [proteron pros humas]. This was his former plan [proteron] while in
   Ephesus to go to Achaia directly from Ephesus. This he confesses in
   verse 16 "and by you to pass into Macedonia." That ye might have a
   second benefit [hina deuteran charin schete]. Or second "joy" if we
   accept [charan] with Westcott and Hort. This would be a real second
   blessing (or joy) if they should have two visits from Paul.

   1:16 And again [kai palin]. This would have been the second benefit or
   joy. But he changed his plans and did not make that trip directly to
   Corinth, but came on to Macedonia first (Ac 19:21; 20:1f.; 1Co 16:2;
   2Co 2:12). To be set forward by you [huph' humOn propemphthenai]. First
   aorist passive infinitive of [propempO]. Paul uses this same verb in Ro
   15:24 for the same service by the Roman Christians on his proposed trip
   to Spain. The Corinthians, especially the anti-Pauline party, took
   advantage of Paul's change of plans to criticize him sharply for
   vacillation and flippancy. How easy it is to find fault with the
   preacher! So Paul has to explain his conduct.

   1:17 Did I shew fickleness? [meti ara tei elaphriai?]. An indignant
   negative answer is called for by [meti]. The instrumental case of
   [elaphriai] is regular after [echresamen] from [chraomai], to use.
   [Elaphria] is a late word for levity from the old adjective,
   [elaphros], light, agile (2Co 10:17; Mt 11:30). Here only in N.T.
   Purpose [bouleuomai]. Paul raises the question of fickleness about any
   of his plans. Yea yea [Nai nai] --nay nay [ou ou]. See a similar
   repetition in Mt 5:37. It is plain in Jas 5:12 where "the yea" is "yea"
   and "the nay" is "nay." That seems to be Paul's meaning here, "that the
   Yea may be yea and the Nay may be nay."

   1:18 Is not yea and nay [ouk estin nai kai ou]. He is not a Yes and No
   man, saying Yes and meaning or acting No. Paul calls God to witness on
   this point.

   1:19 Was not Yea and Nay [ouk egeneto nai kai ou]. "Did not become Yes
   and No." But in him is yea [alla Nai en autOi gegonen]. Rather, "But in
   him Yes has become yes," has proved true. So Paul appeals to the life
   of Christ to sustain his own veracity.

   1:20 In him is the yea [en autOi to Nai]. Supply [gegonen] from the
   preceding sentence, "In him was the Yea come true." This applies to all
   God's promises. The Amen [to Amen]. In public worship (1Co 14:16).

   1:21 Establishes [bebaiOn]. Present active participle from [bebaios],
   firm. An apt metaphor in Corinth where confirmation of a bargain often
   took place [bebaiOsis] as Deissmann shows (Bible Studies, p. 109) and
   as verse 22 makes plain. Anointed [chrisas]. From [chriO], to anoint,
   old verb, to consecrate, with the Holy Spirit here as in 1Jo 2:20.

   1:22 Sealed us [sphragisamenos hemas]. From [sphragizO] old verb,
   common in LXX and papyri for setting a seal to prevent opening (Da
   6:17), in place of signature (1Ki 21:18). Papyri examples show a wide
   legal use to give validity to documents, to guarantee genuineness of
   articles as sealing sacks and chests, etc. (Deissmann, Bible Studies,
   p. 238; Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary). The earnest of the Spirit
   [ton arrabOna tou pneumatos]. A word of Semitic origin (possibly
   Phoenician) and spelled both [arabOn] and [arrabOn]. It is common in
   the papyri as earnest money in a purchase for a cow or for a wife (a
   dowry). In N.T. only here; 5:5; Eph 1:14. It is part payment on the
   total obligation and we use the very expression today, "earnest money."
   It is God, says Paul, who has done all this for us and God is Paul's
   pledge that he is sincere. He will come to Corinth in due time. This
   earnest of the Spirit in our hearts is the witness of the Spirit that
   we are God's.

   1:23 But I call God for a witness upon my soul [EgO de martura ton
   theon epikaloumai epi ten emen psuchen]. Solemn attestation, "calling
   heaven to witness is frequent in literature from Homer onwards"
   (Plummer). Thus God is described above (cf. 1Th 2:5,10; Ro 1:9; Ga
   1:20; Php 1:8). To spare you [pheidomenos humOn]. Present middle
   participle (causal rather than final) of [pheidomai], old verb, to hold
   back, to spare. Ablative case [humOn].

   1:24 We have lordship over [kurieuomen]. Old verb from [kurios], to be
   lord of or over. See Lu 22:25. Helpers of your joy [sunergoi tes charas
   humOn]. Co-workers (1Co 3:8) in your joy. A delicate correction to
   present misapprehension [epanorthOsis].
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2

   2:1 That I would not come again to you with sorrow [to me palin en
   lupei pros humas elthein]. Articular second aorist active infinitive
   with negative [me] in apposition with [touto] (this) preceding. What
   does Paul mean by "again" [palin]? Had he paid another visit besides
   that described in Ac 18 which was in sorrow [en lupei]? Or does he mean
   that having had one joyful visit (that in Ac 18) he does not wish the
   second one to be in sorrow? Either interpretation is possible as the
   Greek stands and scholars disagree. So in 12:14 "The third time I am
   ready to come" may refer to the proposed second visit (1:15f.) and the
   present plan (a third). And so as to 13:1. There is absolutely no way
   to tell clearly whether Paul had already made a second visit. If he had
   done so, it is a bit odd that he did not plainly say so in 1:15f. when
   he is apologizing for not having made the proposed visit ("a second
   benefit").

   2:2 Who then? [kai tis?]. For this use of [kai] see on Mr 10:26; Joh
   9:36. The [kai] accepts the condition (first class [ei--lupO] and shows
   the paradox that follows. [LupeO] is old word from [lupe] (sorrow) in
   causative sense, to make sorry. Maketh glad [euphrainOn]. Present
   active participle of old word from [eu], well, and [phren], mind, to
   make joyful, causative idea like [lupeO].

   2:3 I wrote this very thing [egrapsa touto auto]. Is this (and
   [egrapsa] in verses 4, 9, 12) the epistolary aorist referring to the
   present letter? In itself that is possible as the epistolary aorist
   does occur in the N.T. as in 8:18; 9:3 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 854f.).
   If not epistolary aorist as seems improbable from the context and from
   7:8-12, to what Epistle does he refer? To 1Co 5 or to a lost letter? It
   is possible, of course, that, when Paul decided not to come to Corinth,
   he sent a letter. The language that follows in verses 3, 4; 7:8-12 can
   hardly apply to I Corinthians. Should have sorrow [lupen schO]. Second
   aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of [echO], should get sorrow,
   after [hina me] negative final particles. From them of whom [aph' hOn].
   Antecedent omitted, [apo toutOn aph' hOn] (from those from whom). I
   ought [edei me]. Imperfect for unrealized present obligation as often
   and like English. Having confidence [pepoithOs]. Second perfect active
   participle of [peithO] (1:9).

   2:4 Anguish [sunoches]. Ablative case after [ek] (out of). Old word
   from [sunechO], to hold together. So contraction of heart (Cicero,
   contractio animi), a spiritual angina pectoris. In N.T. only here and
   Lu 21:25. With many tears [dia pollOn dakruOn]. He dictated that letter
   "through tears" (accompanied by tears). Paul was a man of heart. He
   writes to the Philippians with weeping [klaiOn] over the enemies of the
   Cross of Christ (Php 3:18). He twice mentions his tears in his speech
   at Miletus (Ac 20:19-31). But that ye might know the love [alla ten
   agapen hina gnOte]. Proleptic position of [agapen] and ingressive
   second aorist active subjunctive [gnOte], come to know.

   2:5 If any [ei tis]. Scholars disagree whether Paul refers to 1Co 5:1,
   where he also employs [tis, toioutos], and [Satanas] as here, or to the
   ringleader of the opposition to him. Either view is possible. In both
   cases Paul shows delicacy of feeling by not mentioning the name. But in
   part [alla apo merous]. "But to some extent to you all." The whole
   Corinthian Church has been injured in part by this man's wrongdoing.
   There is a parenthesis (that I press not too heavily, [hina me epibarO]
   that interrupts the flow of ideas. [EpibareO], to put a burden on [epi,
   baros], is a late word, only in Paul in N.T. (here and 1Th 2:9; 2Th
   3:8). He does not wish to give pain by too severe language.

   2:6 Punishment [epitimia]. Late word for old Greek to [epitimion] (so
   papyri), from [epitimaO], to show honour to, to award, to adjudge
   penalty. Only here in N.T. By the many [hupo tOn pleionOn]. By the
   more, the majority. If Paul refers to the case in 1Co 5, they had taken
   his advice and expelled the offender.

   2:7 So that on the contrary [hOste tounantion]. The natural result
   expressed by [hOste] and the infinitive. [Tounantion] is by crasis for
   [to enantion] and accusative of general reference. Rather [mallon].
   Absent in some MSS. Lest by any means [me pOs]. Negative purpose.
   Swallowed up [katapothei]. First aorist passive subjunctive of
   [katapinO], to drink down (1Co 15:54). With his overmuch sorrow [tei
   perissoterai lupei]. Instrumental case, "by the more abundant sorrow"
   (comparative of adjective [perissos].

   2:8 To confirm [kurOsai]. First aorist active infinitive of old verb
   [kuroO], to make valid, to ratify, from [kuros] (head, authority). In
   N.T. only here and Ga 3:15.

   2:9 That I might know the proof of you [hina gnO ten dokimen humOn].
   Ingressive second aorist active subjunctive, come to know. [Dokime] is
   proof by testing. Late word from [dokimos] and is in Dioscorides,
   medical writer in reign of Hadrian. Earliest use in Paul and only in
   him in N.T. (2Co 2:9; 8:2; 9:13; 13:3; Ro 5:4; Php 2:22). Obedient
   [hupekooi]. Old word from [hupakouO], to give ear. In N.T. only in Paul
   (2Co 2:9; Php 2:8; Ac 7:39).

   2:10 In the person of Christ [en prosOpOi Christou]. More exactly, "in
   the presence of Christ," before Christ, in the face of Christ. Cf.
   [enOpion tou theou] (4:2) in the eye of God, [enOpion Kuriou] (8:21).

   2:11 That no advantage may be gained over us [hina me pleonektethOmen].
   First aorist passive subjunctive after [hina me] (negative purpose) of
   [pleonekteO], old verb from [pleonektes], a covetous man (1Co 5:10f.),
   to take advantage of, to gain, to overreach. In N.T. only in 1Th 4:6;
   2Co 2:11; 7:2; 12:17f. "That we may not be overreached by Satan." His
   devices [autou ta noemata]. [Noema] from [noeO] to use the [nous] is
   old word, especially for evil plans and purposes as here.

   2:12 To Troas [eis ten TrOiada]. Luke does not mention this stop at
   Troas on the way from Ephesus to Macedonia (Ac 20:1f.), though he does
   mention two other visits there (Ac 16:8; 20:6). When a door was opened
   unto me [thuras moi aneOigmenes]. Genitive absolute with second perfect
   passive participle of [anoignumi]. Paul used this very metaphor in 1Co
   16:9. He will use it again in Col 4:3. Here was an open door that he
   could not enter.

   2:13 I had no relief [ouk escheka anesin]. Perfect active indicative
   like that in 1:9, vivid dramatic recital, not to be treated as "for"
   the aorist (Robertson, Grammar, p. 896, 898ff.). He still feels the
   shadow of that restlessness. [Anesis], from [aniemi], to let up, to
   hold back, is old word for relaxing or release (Ac 24:34). For my
   spirit [tOi pneumati mou]. Dative of interest. Because I found not
   Titus [tOi me heurein me Titon]. Instrumental case of the articular
   infinitive with negative [me] and accusative of general reference [me],
   "by the not finding Titus as to me." Taking my leave of them
   [apotaxamenos autois]. First aorist middle participle of [apotassO],
   old verb, to set apart, in middle in late Greek to separate oneself, to
   bid adieu to as in Mr 6:46.

   2:14 But thanks be unto God [tOi de theOi charis]. Sudden outburst of
   gratitude in contrast to the previous dejection in Troas. Surely a new
   paragraph should begin here. In point of fact Paul makes a long
   digression from here to 6:10 on the subject of the Glory of the
   Christian Ministry as Bachmann points out in his Kommentar (p. 124),
   only he runs it from 2:12-7:1 (Aus der Tiefe in die Hohe, Out of the
   Depths to the Heights). We can be grateful for this emotional outburst,
   Paul's rebound of joy on meeting Titus in Macedonia, for it has given
   the world the finest exposition of all sides of the Christian ministry
   in existence, one that reveals the wealth of Paul's nature and his
   mature grasp of the great things in service for Christ. See my The
   Glory of the Ministry (An Exposition of II Cor. 2:12-6:10). Always
   [pantote]. The sense of present triumph has blotted out the gloom at
   Troas. Leadeth in triumph [thriambeuonti]. Late common Koine word from
   [thriambos] (Latin triumphus, a hymn sung in festal processions to
   Bacchus). Verbs in [-euO] (like [matheteuO], to make disciples) may be
   causative, but no example of [thriambeuO] has been found with this
   meaning. It is always to lead in triumph, in papyri sometimes to make a
   show of. Picture here is of Paul as captive in God's triumphal
   procession. The savour [ten osmen]. In a Roman triumph garlands of
   flowers scattered sweet odour and incense bearers dispensed perfumes.
   The knowledge of God is here the aroma which Paul had scattered like an
   incense bearer.

   2:15 A sweet savour of Christ [Christou euOdia]. Old word from [eu],
   well, and [ozO], to smell. In N.T. only here and Php 4:18; Eph 5:2. In
   spreading the fragrance of Christ the preacher himself becomes fragrant
   (Plummer). In them that are perishing [en tois apollumenois]. Even in
   these if the preacher does his duty.

   2:16 From death unto death [ek thanatou eis thanaton]. From one evil
   condition to another. Some people are actually hardened by preaching.
   And who is sufficient for these things? [kai pros tauta tis hikanos?].
   Rhetorical question. In himself no one is. But some one has to preach
   Christ and Paul proceeds to show that he is sufficient. For we are not
   as the many [ou gar esmen hOs hoi polloi]. A bold thing to say, but
   necessary and only from God (3:6).

   2:17 Corrupting [kapeleuontes]. Old word from [kapelos], a huckster or
   peddlar, common in all stages of Greek for huckstering or trading. It
   is curious how hucksters were suspected of corrupting by putting the
   best fruit on top of the basket. Note Paul's solemn view of his
   relation to God as a preacher (from God [ek theou], in the sight of God
   [katenanti theou], in Christ [en ChristOi].
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3

   3:1 To commend ourselves? [heautous sunistanein?]. Late (Koine) form of
   [sunistemi], to place one with another, to introduce, to commend. Paul
   is sensitive over praising himself, though his enemies compelled him to
   do it. Epistles of commendation [sustatikOn epistolOn]. Late verbal
   adjective from [sunistemi] and often in the papyri and in just this
   sense. In the genitive case here after [chreizomen]. Such letters were
   common as seen in the papyri (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East,
   p. 226). N.T. examples of commending individuals by letters occur in Ac
   15:25f.; 18:27 (Apollos), 1Co 16:10f. (Timothy); Ro 16:1 (Phoebe with
   the verb [sunistemi]; Col 4:10 (Mark); 2Co 8:22f. (Titus and his
   companion).

   3:2 Ye are our epistle [he epistole hemOn humeis este]. Bold turn. Paul
   was writing in their hearts. Known and read [ginOskomene kai
   anaginOskomene]. Play on the word. Literally true. Professing
   Christians are the Bible that men read and know.

   3:3 An epistle of Christ [epistole Christou]. He turns the metaphor
   round and round. They are Christ's letter to men as well as Paul's. Not
   with ink [ou melani]. Instrumental case of [melas], black. Plato uses
   [to melan] for ink as here. See also 2Jo 1:12; 3Jo 1:13. Of stone
   [lithinais]. Composed of stone [lithos] and ending [-inos]. Of flesh
   [sarkinais]. "Fleshen" as in 1Co 3:1; Ro 7:14.

   3:4 Through Christ [dia tou Christou]. It is not self-conceit on Paul's
   part, but through Christ.

   3:5 Of ourselves [aph' heautOn]. Starting from ourselves (reflexive
   pronoun). As from ourselves [hOs ex hautOn]. He says it over again with
   preposition [ex] (out of). He has no originating power for such
   confidence. Sufficiency [hikanotes]. Old word, only here in N.T.

   3:6 Who also made us sufficient for such confidence [hos kai hikanOsen
   hemas]. Late causative verb from [hikanos] (verse 5) first aorist
   active indicative, "who (God) rendered us fit." In N.T. only here and
   Col 1:12. As ministers of a new covenant [diakonous kaines diathekes].
   Predicate accusative with [hikanOsen]. For [diatheke] see on Mt 26:28
   and for [diakonos] on Mt 20:26 and for [kaines] (fresh and effective)
   on Lu 5:38. Only God can make us that.

   3:7 Of death [tou thanatou]. Subjective genitive, marked by death in
   its outcome (cf. 1Co 15:56; Ga 3:10). The letter kills. Engraven on
   stones [entetupOmene lithois]. Perfect passive participle of [entupoO],
   late verb, to imprint a figure [tupos]. Used by Aristias (67) of the
   "inlaid" work on the table sent by Ptolemy Philadelphus to Jerusalem.
   [Lithois] in locative case. Came with glory [egenethe en doxei]. In
   glory. As it did, condition of first class, assumed as true. See Ex
   34:29, 35. Look steadfastly [atenisai]. Late verb from [atenes]
   (stretched, intent, [teinO] and [a] intensive) as in Lu 4:20; Ac 3:4.
   Was passing away [katargoumenen]. Late verb, to render of no effect,
   and present passive participle here as in 1Co 2:6.

   3:8 How shall not rather? [pOs ouchi mallon?]. Argumentum a minore ad
   majus (from the less to the greater). Of the spirit [tou pneumatos].
   Marked by the spirit. Picture of the Christian ministry now.

   3:9 Of condemnation [tes katakriseOs]. Genitive, that brings
   condemnation because unable to obey the law. Is glory [doxa]. No
   copula, but makes the figure bolder. Paul freely admits the glory for
   the old dispensation. Of righteousness [tes dikaiosunes]. Marked by and
   leading to righteousness. See 11:15. Much more [pollOi mallon].
   Instrumental case, by much more. Exceed [perisseuei]. Overflow.

   3:10 In this respect [en toutOi tOi merei]. The glory on the face of
   Moses was temporary, though real, and passed away (verse 7), a type of
   the dimming of the glory of the old dispensation by the brightness of
   the new. The moon makes a dim light after the sun rises, "is not
   glorified" [ou dedoxastai], perfect passive indicative of [doxazO]. By
   reason of the glory that surpasseth [heineken tes huperballouses
   doxes]. The surpassing [huper-ballO], throwing beyond) glory. Christ as
   the Sun of Righteousness has thrown Moses in the shade. Cf. the claims
   of superiority by Christ in Mt 5-7.

   3:11 Passeth away [katargoumenon]. In process of disappearing before
   the gospel of Christ. Remaineth [menon]. The new ministry is permanent.
   This claim may be recommended to those who clamour for a new religion.
   Christianity is still alive and is not dying. Note also [en doxei], in
   glory, in contrast with [dia doxes], with glory. Boldness [parresiai].
   Instrumental case after [chrOmetha]. Old word, [panresis=parresis],
   telling it all, absolute unreservedness. Surely Paul has kept nothing
   back here, no mental reservations, in this triumphant claim of
   superiority.

   3:13 Put a veil upon his face [etithei kalumma epi to prosOpon autou].
   Imperfect active of [tithemi], used to put (Ex 34:33). That the
   children of Israel should not look steadfastly [pros to me atenisai
   tous huious]. Purpose expressed by [pros] and the articular infinitive
   with negative [me] and the accusative of general reference. The
   Authorized Version had a wrong translation here as if to hide the glory
   on his face.

   3:14 But their minds were hardened [alla epOrOthe ta noemata autOn].
   Their thoughts [noemata] literally. [POroO] (first aorist passive
   indicative here) is late verb from [pOros], hard skin, to cover with
   thick skin (callus), to petrify. See on Mr 6:52; 8:17. Of the old
   covenant [tes palaias diathekes]. The Old Testament. [Palaios]
   (ancient) in contrast to [kainos] (fresh, verse 6). See Mt 13:52. The
   same veil [to auto kalumma]. Not that identical veil, but one that has
   the same effect, that blinds their eyes to the light in Christ. This is
   the tragedy of modern Judaism. Unlifted [me anakaluptomenon]. Present
   passive participle of [anakaluptO], old verb, to draw back the veil, to
   unveil. Is done away [katargeitai]. Same verb as in verses 7, 11.

   3:15 Whensoever Moses is read [henika an anaginOsketai MOuses].
   Indefinite temporal clause with [henika] an and the present passive
   subjunctive. A veil lieth upon their heart [epi ten kardian autOn
   keitai]. Vivid and distressing picture, a fact that caused Paul agony
   of heart (Ro 9:1-5). With wilful blindness the rabbis set aside the
   word of God by their tradition in the time of Jesus (Mr 7:8f.).

   3:16 It shall turn [epistrepsei]. The heart of Israel. The veil is
   taken away [periaireitai to kalumma]. Present passive indicative of
   [periaireO], old verb, to take from around, as of anchors (Ac 27:40),
   to cut loose (Ac 28:13), for hope to be taken away (Ac 27:20). Here
   Paul has in mind Ex 34:34 where we find of Moses that [perieireito to
   kalumma] (the veil was taken from around his face) whenever he went
   before the Lord. After the ceremony the veil is taken from around
   [peri-] the face of the bride.

   3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit [ho de Kurios to pneuma estin]. Some,
   like E. F. Scott (The Spirit in the N.T.), take [Kurios] here to be
   Christ and interpret Paul as denying the personality of the Holy
   Spirit, identifying Christ and the Holy Spirit. But is not Bernard
   right here in taking [Kurios] (Lord) in the same sense here as in Ex
   34:34 [enanti Kuriou], before the Lord), the very passage that Paul is
   quoting? Certainly, the Holy Spirit is interchangeably called in the
   N.T. the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ (Ro 8:9f.). Christ
   dwells in us by the Holy Spirit, but the language here in 2Co 3:17
   should not be pressed unduly (Plummer. See also P. Gardner, The
   Religious Experience of St. Paul, p. 176f.). Note "the Spirit of the
   Lord" here. Liberty [eleutheria]. Freedom of access to God without fear
   in opposition to the fear in Ex 34:30. We need no veil and we have free
   access to God.

   3:18 We all [hemeis pantes]. All of us Christians, not merely
   ministers. With unveiled face [anakekalummenOi prosOpOi]. Instrumental
   case of manner. Unlike and like Moses. Reflecting as in a mirror
   [katoptrizomenoi]. Present middle participle of [katoptrizO], late verb
   from [katoptron], mirror [kata, optron], a thing to see with). In Philo
   (Legis Alleg. iii. 33) the word means beholding as in a mirror and that
   idea suits also the figure in 1Co 13:12. There is an inscription of
   third century B.C. with [egkatoptrisasthai eis to hudOr], to look at
   one's reflection in the water. Plutarch uses the active for mirroring
   or reflecting and Chrysostom takes it so here. Either makes good sense.
   The point that Paul is making is that we shall not lose the glory as
   Moses did. But that is true if we keep on beholding or keep on
   reflecting (present tense). Only here in N.T. Are transformed
   [metamorphoumetha]. Present passive (are being transformed) of
   [metamorphoO], late verb and in papyri. See on Mt 17:2; Mr 9:2 where it
   is translated "transfigured." It is the word used for heathen
   mythological metamorphoses. Into the same image [ten auten eikona].
   Accusative retained with passive verb [metamorphoumetha]. Into the
   likeness of God in Christ (1Co 15:48-53; Ro 8:17,29; Col 3:4; 1Jo 3:2).
   As from the Lord the Spirit [kathaper apo Kuriou pneumatos]. More
   likely, "as from the Spirit of the Lord."
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4

   4:1 We faint not [ouk egkakoumen]. Present active indicative of
   [egkakeO], late verb [en, kakos] to behave badly in, to give in to
   evil, to lose courage. In Symmachus (LXX), Polybius, and papyri. It is
   the faint-hearted coward. Paul speaks of himself (literary plural). Can
   he not speak for all of us?

   4:2 But we have renounced [alla apeipametha]. Indirect middle second
   aorist (timeless aorist) indicative of [apeipon] (defective verb) with
   [a] of first aorist ending, to speak forth, to speak off or away from.
   Common verb in the active, but rare in middle and only here in N.T. The
   hidden things of shame [ta krupta tes aischunes]. They do attack the
   minister. His only safety is in instant and courageous defiance to all
   the powers of darkness. It is a terrible thing to see a preacher caught
   in the toils of the tempter. In craftiness [en panourgiai]. Old word
   from [panourgos] [pan, ergon], a doer of any deed (good or bad),
   clever, cunning, deceitful. See on Lu 20:23. Handling deceitfully
   [dolountes]. Present active participle of [doloO], from [dolos], deceit
   (from [delO], to catch with bait), old and common verb, in papyri and
   inscriptions, to ensnare, to corrupt with error. Only here in N.T. Used
   of adulterating gold or wine. To every conscience of men [pros pasan
   suneidesin anthrOpOn]. Not to whim, foible, prejudice. See 3:1-6 for
   "commending" [sunistanontes].

   4:3 It is veiled in them that are perishing [en tois apollumenois estin
   kekalummenon]. Periphrastic perfect passive of [kaluptO], to veil in
   both condition (first class) and conclusion. See on 2:15f. for "the
   perishing."

   4:4 The god of this world [ho theos tou aiOnos toutou]. "Age," more
   exactly, as in 1Co 1:20. Satan is "the god of this age," a phrase
   nowhere else in the N.T., but Jesus uses the same idea in Joh 12:31;
   14:30 and Paul in Eph 2:2; 6:12 and John in 1Jo 5:19. Satan claimed the
   rule over the world in the temptations with Jesus. Blinded
   [etuphlOsen]. First aorist active of [tuphloO], old verb to blind
   [tuphlos], blind). They refused to believe [apistOn] and so Satan got
   the power to blind their thoughts. That happens with wilful
   disbelievers. The light [ton phOtismon]. The illumination, the
   enlightening. Late word from [photizO], to give light, in Plutarch and
   LXX. In N.T. only in 2Co 4:4, 6. Accusative case of general reference
   here with the articular infinitive [eis to me augasai] that should not
   dawn). That is, if [augasai] is intransitive as is likely, though it is
   transitive in the old poets (from [auge], radiance. Cf. German Auge =
   eye). If it is transitive, the idea would be "that they should not see
   clearly the illumination, etc."

   4:5 For we preach not ourselves [ou gar heautous kerussomen]. Surely as
   poor and disgusting a topic as a preacher can find. But Christ Jesus as
   Lord [alla Christon Iesoun Kurion]. [Kurion] is predicate accusative in
   apposition. As your servants for Jesus' sake [doulous humOn dia
   Iesoun]. Your bond-slave for the sake of Jesus. This is the sufficient
   reason for any preacher's sacrifice, "for Jesus' sake."

   4:6 God who said [ho theos ho eipOn]. Paraphrase of Ge 1:3. Who shined
   [hos elampsen]. Like a lamp in the heart (cf. Mt 5:15). Miners carry a
   lamp on the forehead, Christians carry one in their hearts lit by the
   Spirit of God. To give the light [pros phOtismon]. For the
   illumination. In the face of Jesus Christ [en prosOpOi Iesou Christou].
   The Christian who looks on the face of Jesus Christ as Moses looked
   upon the glory of God will be able to give the illumination of the
   knowledge of the glory of God. See 2:10 for [prosOpon].

   4:7 This treasure [ton thesauron touton]. On [thesauron] see Mt
   6:19-21. It is the power of giving the illumination of the knowledge of
   the glory of God (verse 6). "The power is limitless, but it is stored
   in very unlikely receptacles" (Plummer). This warning Paul gives in
   contrast [de] with the exultation of verse 6 (Bernard). In earthen
   vessels [en ostrakinois skeuesin]. This adjective is common in the LXX
   with [skeuos, aggos] and [aggeion]. It occurs again in 2Ti 2:20 with
   [skeue]. It is found also in the papyri with [skeuos] as here. It is
   from [ostrakon], baked clay (same root as [osteon], bone), so many
   fragments of which are found in Egypt with writing on them. We are but
   earthen jars used of God for his purposes (Ro 9:20ff.) and so fragile.
   The exceeding greatness [he huperbole]. See on 1Co 12:31 for this word,
   "the preeminence of the power." This is God's purpose [hina--ei]. God,
   not man, is the dynamo [dunamis]. It comes from God [tou theou],
   ablative) and does not originate with us [me ex hemOn].

   4:8 Pressed [thlibomenoi]. From [thlibO], to press as grapes, to
   contract, to squeeze. Series of present passive participles here
   through verse 9 that vividly picture Paul's ministerial career. Yet not
   straitened [all' ou stenochOroumenoi]. Each time the exception is
   stated by [all' ou]. From [stenochOreO] [stenochOros], from [stenos],
   narrow, [chOros], space), to be in a narrow place, to keep in a tight
   place. Late verb, in LXX and papyri. In N.T. only here and 2Co 6:12.
   Yet not unto despair [all' ouk exaporoumenoi]. Late perfective compound
   with [ex-] of [exaporeO]. A very effective play on words here, lost,
   but not lost out.

   4:9 Forsaken [egkataleipomenoi]. Double compound of old verb
   [eg-kata-leipO], to leave behind, to leave in the lurch. Smitten down
   [kataballomenoi]. As if overtaken. Destroyed [apollumenoi]. Perishing
   as in verse 3. Was Paul referring to Lystra when the Jews stoned him
   and thought him dead?

   4:10 Bearing about [peripherontes]. Ignatius was called [Theophoros],
   God-bearer. See 1Co 15:31 where Paul says "I die daily" and Php 3:10;
   Col 1:24. The dying of Jesus [ten nekrOsin tou Iesou]. Late word from
   [nekroO], to put to death. In Galen. In N.T. only here and Ro 4:19.

   4:11 Are alway delivered unto death [eis thanaton paradidometha]. This
   explains verse 10.

   4:12 Death worketh in us [ho thanatos en hemin energeitai]. Middle
   voice present tense of the old verb to operate, be at work. Physical
   death works in him while spiritual life (paradox) works in them.

   4:13 According to that which is written [kata to gegrammenon]. This
   formula in legal documents in the papyri (Bible Studies, p. 250). Paul
   makes adaptation of the words in Ps 95:1. We also believe [kai hemeis
   pisteuomen]. Like the Psalmist. And therefore can speak with effect.
   Otherwise useless. Shall present us with you [kai parastesei sun
   hemin]. This shows that Paul was not certain that he would be alive
   when Jesus comes as has been wrongly inferred from 1Co 7:29; 10:11;
   15:51.

   4:15 Being multiplied through the many [pleonasasa dia tOn pleionOn].
   Late word [pleonazO] from [pleon], more, "making more through the
   more," with play on [pleon]. One can think of Bunyan's Grace Abounding.

   4:16 Wherefore we faint not [dio ouk egkakoumen]. Repeats from verse 1.
   Our outward man [ho exO hemOn anthrOpos], our inward man [ho esO
   hemOn]. In Ro 7:22; Col 3:9; Eph 4:22f., we have the inward man and the
   outward for the higher and the lower natures (the spirit and the
   flesh). "Here the decay [diaphtheiretai] of the bodily organism is set
   over against the growth in grace [anakainoutai], is refreshed) of the
   man himself" (Bernard). Plato (Republ. ix, p. 589) has [ho entos
   anthrOpos]. Cf. "the hidden man of the heart" (1Pe 3:4). Day by day
   [hemerai kai hemerai]. This precise idiom is not in LXX nor rest of
   N.T. It may be colloquial use of locative in repetition.

   4:17 Our light affliction which is for the moment [to parautika
   elaphron tes thlipeseOs hemOn]. Literally, "the for the moment (old
   adverb [parautika], here only in N.T.) lightness (old word, in N.T.
   only here and Mt 11:30)." More and more exceedingly [kath' huperbolen
   eis huperbolen]. Like piling Pelion on Ossa, "according to excess unto
   excess." See on 1Co 12:31. Eternal weight of glory [aiOnion baros
   doxes]. Careful balancing of words in contrast (affliction vs. glory,
   lightness vs. weight, for the moment vs. eternal).

   4:18 While we look not [me skopountOn hemOn]. Genitive absolute with
   participle of [skopeO] from [skopos], goal. Temporal [proskaira].
   Rather temporary, for a season [pros kairon]. Late word. See on Mt
   13:21. See 1Co 13:12; Heb 11:1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 5

   5:1 If--be dissolved [ean--kataluthei]. Third class condition, [ean]
   and first aorist passive subjunctive. The very word used [kataluO] for
   striking down a tent. The earthly house of our tabernacle [he epigeios
   hemOn oikia tou skenous]. Rather, "If our earthly (see on 1Co 15:40 for
   [epigeios] house of the tent [skenos], another form of [skene], tent,
   from root [ska], to cover)."; Appositive genitive, the house [oikia] is
   the tent. We have [echomen]. Present indicative. We possess the title
   to it now by faith. "Faith is the title-deed [hupostasis] to things
   hoped for" (Heb 11:7). A building from God [oikodomen ek theou]. This
   [oikodome] (found in Aristotle, Plutarch, LXX, etc., and papyri, though
   condemned by Atticists) is more substantial than the [skenos]. Not made
   with hands [acheiropoieton]. Found first in Mr 14:58 in charge against
   Jesus before the Sanhedrin (both the common verbal [cheiropoieton] and
   the newly made vernacular [acheiropoieton], same verbal with [a]
   privative). Elsewhere only here and Col 2:11. Spiritual, eternal home.

   5:2 To be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven [to
   oiketerion hemOn to ex ouranou ependusasthai]. First aorist middle
   infinitive of late verb [ependuO], double compound [ep, en] to put upon
   oneself. Cf. [ependutes] for a fisherman's linen blouse or upper
   garment (Joh 21:7). [Oiketerion] is old word used here of the spiritual
   body as the abode of the spirit. It is a mixed metaphor (putting on as
   garment the dwelling-place).

   5:3 Being clothed [endusamenoi]. First aorist middle participle, having
   put on the garment. Naked [gumnoi]. That is, disembodied spirits, "like
   the souls in Sheol, without form, and void of all power of activity"
   (Plummer).

   5:4 Not for that we would be unclothed [eph' hOi ou thelomen
   ekdusasthai]. Rather, "For that [eph' hOi] we do not wish to put off
   the clothing, but to put it on" [all' ependusasthai]. The transposition
   of the negative [ou] weakens the sense. Paul does not wish to be a mere
   disembodied spirit without his spiritual garment. That what is mortal
   may be swallowed up of life [hina katapothei to thneton hupo tes zOes].
   "Only what is mortal perishes; the personality, consisting of soul and
   body, survives," (Plummer). See on 1:22 for "the earnest of the
   spirit."

   5:6 At home in the body [endemountes en tOi sOmati]. Rare verb
   [endemeO] from [endemos] (one among his own people as opposed to
   [ekdemos], one away from home). Both [ekdemeO] (more common in the old
   Greek) and [endemeO] occur in the papyri with the contrast made by Paul
   here.

   5:7 By sight [dia eidous]. Rather, by appearance.

   5:8 We are of good courage [tharroumen]. Good word for cheer and same
   root as [tharseO] (Mt 9:2,22). Cheer up. Are willing rather
   [eudokoumen]. Rather, "We are well-pleased, we prefer" if left to
   ourselves. Cf. Php 1:21f. Same [eudokeO] used in Lu 3:22. To be at home
   with the Lord [endemesai pros ton Kurion]. First aorist (ingressive)
   active infinitive, to attain that goal is bliss for Paul.

   5:9 We make it our aim [philotimoumetha]. Old and common verb, present
   middle, from [philotimos] [philos, time], fond of honour), to act from
   love of honour, to be ambitious in the good sense (1Th 4:11; 2Co 5:9;
   Ro 15:20). The Latin ambitio has a bad sense from ambire, to go both
   ways to gain one's point. To be well-pleasing to him [euarestoi autOi
   einai]. Late adjective that shows Paul's loyalty to Christ, his
   Captain. Found in several inscriptions in the Koine period (Deissmann,
   Bible Studies, p. 214; Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary).

   5:10 Before the judgment-seat of Christ [emprosthen tou bematos tou
   Christou]. Old word [bema], a step (from [bainO], a platform, the seat
   of the judge (Mt 27:19). Christ is Saviour, Lord, and Judge of us all
   [tous pantas], the all). That each may receive [hina komisetai
   hekastos]. Receive as his due, [komizO] means, old verb. See on Mt
   25:27. Bad [phaulon]. Old word, akin to German faul, worthless, of no
   account, base, wicked.

   5:11 The fear of the Lord [ton phobon tou Kuriou]. Many today regard
   this a played-out motive, but not so Paul. He has in mind verse 10 with
   the picture of the judgment seat of Christ. We persuade [peithomen].
   Conative present active, we try to persuade. It is always hard work.
   Unto God [theOi]. Dative case. God understands whether men do or not.
   That we are made manifest [pephanerOsthai]. Perfect passive infinitive
   of [phaneroO] in indirect discourse after [elpizO]. Stand manifested,
   state of completion.

   5:12 As giving you occasion of glorying [aphormen didontes humin
   kauchematos]. An old Greek word [apo, horme], onset, rush), a base of
   operations, material with which to glory, as we say "a tip" only much
   more. That ye may have wherewith to answer [hina echete pros].
   Literally, "That ye may have something against (for facing those,
   etc.)." Paul wishes his champions in Corinth to know the facts. In
   appearance, and not in heart [en prosOpOi kai me en kardiai]. He means
   the Judaizers who were braggarts about their orthodox Judaism.

   5:13 Whether we are beside ourselves [eite exestemen]. Second aorist
   active indicative of [existemi], old verb, here to stand out of oneself
   (intransitive) from [ekstasis], ecstasy, comes as in Mr 5:42. It is
   literary plural, for Paul is referring only to himself. See on 1:6 for
   [eite--eite]. It is a condition of the first class and Paul assumes as
   true the charge that he was crazy (if I was crazy) for the sake of
   argument. Festus made it later (Ac 26:24). He spoke with tongues (1Co
   14:18) and had visions (2Co 12:1-6) which probably the Judaizers used
   against him. A like charge was made against Jesus (Mr 3:21). People
   often accuse those whom they dislike with being a bit off.

   5:14 The love of Christ [he agape tou Christou]. Subjective genitive,
   Christ's love for Paul as shown by verse 15. Constraineth us [sunechei
   hemas]. Old and common verb, to hold together, to press the ears
   together (Ac 7:57), to press on every side (Lu 8:45), to hold fast (Lu
   22:63), to hold oneself to (Ac 18:5), to be pressed (passive, Lu 12:50;
   Php 1:23). So here Paul's conception of Christ's love for him holds him
   together to his task whatever men think or say. Judging this [krinantas
   touto]. Having reached this conclusion, ever since his conversion (Ga
   1:17f.). One died for all [heis huper pantOn apethanen]. This is the
   central tenet in Paul's theology and Christology. [Huper] (over) here
   is used in the sense of substitution as in Joh 11:50; Ga 3:13, death in
   behalf so that the rest will not have to die. This use of [huper] is
   common in the papyri (Robertson, Grammar, p. 631). In fact, [huper] in
   this sense is more usual in Greek than [anti, pro] or any other
   preposition. Therefore all died [ara hoi pantes apethanon]. Logical
   conclusion [ara], corresponding), the one died for the all and so the
   all died when he did, all the spiritual death possible for those for
   whom Christ died. This is Paul's gospel, clear-cut, our hope today.

   5:15 Should no longer live unto themselves [hina meketi heautois
   zOsin]. The high doctrine of Christ's atoning death carries a
   correspondingly high obligation on the part of those who live because
   of him. Selfishness is ruled out by our duty to live "unto him who for
   their sakes died and rose again."

   5:16 Henceforth [apo tou nun]. From the time that we gained this view
   of Christ's death for us. After the flesh [kata sarka]. According to
   the flesh, the fleshy way of looking at men. He, of course, knows men
   "in the flesh [en tei sarki], but Paul is not speaking of that. Worldly
   standards and distinctions of race, class, cut no figure now with Paul
   (Ga 3:28) as he looks at men from the standpoint of the Cross of
   Christ. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh [ei kai
   egnOkamen kata sarka Christon]. Concessive clause [ei kai], if even or
   also) with perfect active indicative. Paul admits that he had once
   looked at Christ [kata sarka], but now no longer does it. Obviously he
   uses [kata sarka] in precisely the same sense that he did in verse 15
   about men. He had before his conversion known Christ [kata sarka],
   according to the standards of the men of his time, the Sanhedrin and
   other Jewish leaders. He had led the persecution against Jesus till
   Jesus challenged and stopped him (Ac 9:4). That event turned Paul clean
   round and he no longer knows Christ in the old way [kata sarka]. Paul
   may or may not have seen Jesus in the flesh before his death, but he
   says absolutely nothing on that point here.

   5:17 A new creature [kaine ktisis]. A fresh start is made [kaine].
   [Ktisis] is the old word for the act of creating (Ro 1:20), but in N.T.
   by metonymy it usually bears the notion of [ktisma], the thing created
   or creature as here. The old things are passed away [ta archaia
   parelthen]. Did pass by, he means. Second aorist active of
   [parerchomai], to go by. The ancient [archaia] way of looking at Christ
   among other things. And yet today there are scholars who are trying to
   revive the old prejudiced view of Jesus Christ as a mere man, a
   prophet, to give us "a reduced Christ." That was once Paul's view, but
   it passed by forever for him. It is a false view and leaves us no
   gospel and no Saviour. Behold, they are become new [idou, gegone
   kaina]. Perfect active indicative of [ginomai], have become new (fresh,
   [kaina] to stay so.

   5:18 Who reconciled us to himself through Christ [tou katallaxantos
   hemas heautOi dia Christou]. Here Paul uses one of his great doctrinal
   words, [katallassO], old word for exchanging coins. [DiallassO], to
   change one's mind, to reconcile, occurs in N.T. only in Mt 5:24 though
   in papyri (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, p. 187), and common
   in Attic. [KatallassO] is old verb, but more frequent in later writers.
   We find [sunallassO] in Ac 7:26 and [apokatallassO] in Col 1:20f.; Eph
   2:16 and the substantive [katallage] in Ro 5:11; 11:15 as well as here.
   It is hard to discuss this great theme without apparent contradiction.
   God's love (Joh 3:16) provided the means and basis for man's
   reconciliation to God against whom he had sinned. It is all God's plan
   because of his love, but God's own sense of justice had to be satisfied
   (Ro 3:26) and so God gave his Son as a propitiation for our sins (Ro
   3:25; Col 1:20; 1Jo 2:2; 4:10). The point made by Paul here is that God
   needs no reconciliation, but is engaged in the great business of
   reconciling us to himself. This has to be done on God's terms and is
   made possible through [dia] Christ. And gave unto us the ministry of
   reconciliation [kai dontos hemin ten diakonian tes katallages]. It is a
   ministry marked by reconciliation, that consists in reconciliation. God
   has made possible through Christ our reconciliation to him, but in each
   case it has to be made effective by the attitude of each individual.
   The task of winning the unreconciled to God is committed to us. It is a
   high and holy one, but supremely difficult, because the offending party
   (the guilty) is the hardest to win over. We must be loyal to God and
   yet win sinful men to him.

   5:19 To wit, that [hOs hoti]. Latin puts it quoniam quidem. It is an
   unclassical idiom, but occurs in the papyri and inscriptions (Moulton,
   Prol., p. 212; Robertson, Grammar, p. 1033). It is in Es 4:14. See also
   2Co 11:21; 2Th 2:2. It probably means "how that." Not reckoning [me
   logizomenos]. What Jesus did (his death for us) stands to our credit
   (Ro 8:32) if we make our peace with God. This is our task, "the word of
   reconciliation," that we may receive "the righteousness of God" and be
   adopted into the family of God.

   5:20 We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ [huper Christou
   oun presbeuomen]. Old word from [presbus], an old man, first to be an
   old man, then to be an ambassador (here and Eph 6:20 with [en halusei]
   in a chain added), common in both senses in the Greek. "The proper term
   in the Greek East for the Emperor's Legate" (Deissmann, Light from the
   Ancient East, p. 374), in inscriptions and papyri. So Paul has a
   natural pride in using this dignified term for himself and all
   ministers. The ambassador has to be persona grata with both countries
   (the one that he represents and the one to which he goes). Paul was
   Christ's Legate to act in his behalf and in his stead. As though God
   were intreating by us [hOs tou theou parakalountos di' hemOn]. Genitive
   absolute with [hOs] used with the participle as often to give the
   reason (apparent or real). Here God speaks through Christ's Legate. Be
   ye reconciled to God [katallagete tOi theOi]. Second aorist passive
   imperative of [katallassO] and used with the dative case. "Get
   reconciled to God," and do it now. This is the ambassador's message as
   he bears it to men from God.

   5:21 Him who knew no sin [ton me gnonta hamartian]. Definite claim by
   Paul that Jesus did not commit sin, had no personal acquaintance [me
   gnonta], second aorist active participle of [ginOskO] with it. Jesus
   made this claim for himself (Joh 8:46). This statement occurs also in
   1Pe 2:22; Heb 4:15; 7:26; 1Jo 3:5. Christ was and is "a moral miracle"
   (Bernard) and so more than mere man. He made to be sin [hamartian
   epoiesen]. The words "to be" are not in the Greek. "Sin" here is the
   substantive, not the verb. God "treated as sin" the one "who knew no
   sin." But he knew the contradiction of sinners (Heb 12:3). We may not
   dare to probe too far into the mystery of Christ's suffering on the
   Cross, but this fact throws some light on the tragic cry of Jesus just
   before he died: "My God, My God, why didst thou forsake me?" (Mt
   27:46). That we might become [hina hemeis genOmetha]. Note "become."
   This is God's purpose [hina] in what he did and in what Christ did.
   Thus alone can we obtain God's righteousness (Ro 1:17).
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 6

   6:1 Working together with him [sunergountes]. We are co-workers,
   partners with God (1Co 3:9), in this work of grace. In vain [eis
   kenon]. Into emptiness. The plan of God, the work of Christ on the
   Cross, the pleas of the ambassador may all be nullified by the
   recipient of the message.

   6:2 Behold, now is the acceptable time [idou nun kairos euprosdektos].
   Here is another "Pauline parenthesis" (Plummer) as in 5:7 by the
   quotation from Isa 49:8. The LXX has [dektos] [dektoi] verbal of
   [dechomai], but Paul employs the double compound [eu, pros, dektos],
   well-received. It occurs in Aristophanes, Plutarch, inscription, etc.

   6:3 Giving no occasion of stumbling in any thing [medemian en medeni
   didontes proskopen]. [Proskope], late word (Polybius, LXX), from
   [proskoptO], to strike against, to stumble. Only here in N.T. Note
   double negative in the Greek. That the ministry be not blamed [hina me
   mOmethei he diakonia]. Negative purpose [hina me]. First aorist passive
   subjunctive of old verb [mOmaomai] from [mOmos], blot, blemish. One can
   read with profit J. A. Hutton's Warrack Lectures, That the Ministry Be
   Not Blamed.

   6:4 But in everything commending ourselves [all' en panti sunistanontes
   heautous]. Paul gives a marvellous summary of his argument about the
   dignity and glory of ministers of Christ as ministers of God [hOs theou
   diakonoi] under three aspects, the first with in [en] verses 3-7a, the
   second with by [dia] verses 7b, 8, the third with as [hOs] verses 9-10.
   The negative view with [en] we have in verse 3, then the positive in
   verses 4-7a. Each word carries a story that can be filled in from
   Paul's own life as a preacher with an echo in that of us all. In
   distresses [en stenochOriais]. In tight places (12:10). Late word from
   [stenochOreO] (see on 4:8).

   6:5 In stripes [en plegais]. In blows, wounds (Lu 10:30; 12:48; Ac
   16:23,33). Our plague. In tumults [en akatastasiais]. See on 1Co
   14:33). Instabilities, often from politics. In watchings [en
   agrupniais]. In sleeplessnesses, instances of insomnia. Old word, in
   N.T. only here and 11:27. Paul knew all about this.

   6:6 In love unfeigned [en agapei anupokritOi]. Late and rare word [a]
   privative and [hupokritos], from [hupokrinomai] This is the only love
   that is worth while (Ro 12:9).

   6:7 On the right hand and on the left [tOn dexiOn kai aristerOn].
   Offensive weapons [hoplOn] on the right, defensive on the left. See 1Th
   5:8; Eph 6:11 for Paul's description of the panoply of God and Ro 6:13
   for the phrase "weapons of righteousness," the only kind that will
   stand the strain. See also Book of Wisdom 5:18ff.

   6:8 By glory and dishonour [dia doxes kai atimias]. Here [dia] is no
   longer instrument, but state or condition. [Doxa] here is glory. See Ro
   9:21; 2Ti 2:20 for contrast between honour and dishonour [time,
   atimia]. By evil report and good report [dia dusphemias kai euphemias].
   Play on the words with prefixes [dus-] and [eu-] and [pheme].
   [Dusphemia] is a late word, only here in N.T. [Euphemia], old and
   common word, only here in N.T. As deceivers and yet true [hOs planoi
   kai aletheis]. Paul takes up [hOs] now in place of [dia] which
   succeeded [en]. Note use of [kai] in sense of "and yet" (adversative).
   [Planos] is late word (Diodorus, Josephus) for wandering, vagabond,
   impostor (cf. [planaO], to lead astray, used of Christ, Joh 7:12). In
   N.T. only here; Mt 27:63 (of Christ by Pharisees); 2Jo 1:7. "In the
   Clementines St. Paul is expressly described by his adversaries as
   [planos] and as disseminating deceit [planen]" (Bernard). Such slander
   from one's enemies is praise.

   6:9 As unknown and yet well known [hOs agnooumenoi kai
   epiginoskomenoi]. "As ignored (as nonentities, obscure, without proper
   credentials 3:2) and yet fully recognized (by all who really matter as
   in 11:6)." And behold, we live [kai idou zOmen]. Cf. the hazards of his
   life (1:8; 4:10; 11:23). His whole career is full of paradox).

   6:10 Always rejoicing [aei chairontes]. Even in sorrow (11:9; 1Th 5:16;
   Ro 5:3-5; 9:2; Php 2:18,27; 3:1; 4:4,15). Yet making many rich [pollous
   de ploutizontes]. Old word from [ploutos] (wealth), to enrich.
   Spiritual riches Paul has in mind as in 1Co 1:5 (cf. Mt 5:37). As
   having nothing and yet possessing all things [hOs meden echontes kai
   panta katechontes]. Contrast between [meden] (nothing) and [panta] (all
   things, cf. 1Co 3:22) and [echO] (to have) and [katechO] (to hold down,
   to hold fast). Play on words (simple and compound) as in 3:2; 4:8.
   Climax of Paul's panegyric on the Christian ministry. He now resumes
   the thread of the story broken off in 2:14.

   6:11 Our mouth is open unto you [to stoma hemOn aneOigen pros humas].
   Second perfect active indicative of [anoigO] and intransitive, stand
   open. He has kept back nothing in his portrayal of the glory of the
   ministry as the picture of the open mouth shows. Our heart is enlarged
   [he kardia hemOn peplatuntai]. Perfect passive indicative of old verb
   [platunO], to broaden, from [platus], broad. In N T. only here and Mt
   23:5 (cf. phylacteries). Hence his freedom of speech for "out of the
   abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Mt 12:34).

   6:12 Ye are not straitened in us [ou stenochOreisthe en hemin]. The
   same figure as in verse 11. See on 4:8 for [stenochOreO]. There is no
   restraint in me (my heart). My adversaries may have caused some of you
   to tighten up your affections [splagchna] for affection as in Jas 5:11;
   1Pe 3:8).

   6:13 Now for a recompense in like kind [ten de auten antimisthian]. No
   example of this expressive word outside of this passage and Ro 1:27 and
   later Christian writers. Paul may have found it in use in the Koine
   vernacular or he may have coined it from [antimisthos], remunerating
   (paying back). There is no verb here to explain the accusative which
   may be the accusative of general reference or the object of a verb not
   expressed. Be ye also enlarged [platunthete kai humeis]. As I have been
   (verse 11). First aorist passive imperative of [platunO].

   6:14 Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers [me ginesthe
   heterozugountes apistois]. No other example of this verb has yet been
   found, though the adjective from which it is apparently formed,
   [heterozugos] (yoked with a different yoke) occurs in Le 19:19 of the
   union of beasts of different kinds. In De 22:10 we read: "Thou shalt
   not plough with an ox and an ass together." Literally, "Stop becoming
   [me ginesthe] present imperative, not [me genesthe] aorist subj.)
   unequally yoked with unconverted heathen (unbelievers)." Some were
   already guilty. Marriage is certainly included, but other unions may be
   in mind. Cf. Eph 5:7. Paul gives as the reason [gar] for this
   prohibition five words in questions to distinguish the contrasts.
   Fellowship [metoche]. Sharing with and followed by associative
   instrumental case of [dikaiosunei] (righteousness) and iniquity
   [anomiai]. A pertinent challenge today when church members wink at
   violations of laws of the land and laws of God. Communion [koinOnia].
   Partnership to light [phOti] dative case) with [pros], facing darkness.

   6:15 Concord [sumphOnesis]. Symphony. Late word from [sumphOneO], only
   here and ecclesiastical writers, though [sumphOnema] in the papyri.
   Belial [Belial]. Transliteration of Hebrew word for worthlessness and
   applied to Satan (Book of Jubilees 1.20) as here. Paul graphically sums
   up the contrast between Christ and Belial (Satan), the heads of the
   contending forces of good and evil. Portion [meris]. The fourth of the
   words. Here by "unbeliever" [apistou] Paul means "disbeliever," not
   just an unconverted man who yet approves Christ.

   6:16 Agreement [sunkatathesis]. Fifth of these words. Late word, but
   common, though here only in N.T. Approved by putting together the
   votes. In the papyri [ek sunkatatheseOs] means "by agreement." On the
   temple of God and idols see 1Co 10:14-22. See Lu 23:51 for the verb
   [sunkatatithemi]. For we are the temple of the living God [hemeis gar
   naos theou esmen zOntos]. We, not temples (Ac 7:48; 17:24; 1Co 3:16;
   6:19). As God said [kathOs eipen ho theos]. A paraphrase and catena of
   quotations, what J. Rendel Harris calls Testimonia (from Le 26:11f.;
   Isa 52:11; Eze 20:34; 37:27; 2Sa 7:8, 14). Plummer notes that at the
   beginning "I will dwell in them" [enoikesO en autois] is not in any of
   them. "As God said" points to Le 26:12; Eze 37:27.

   6:17 Saith the Lord [legei Kurios]. Isa 52:5; Eze 20:33. Cf. Re 18:4.
   Unclean thing [akathartou]. Or unclean person. Genitive case is the
   same for both.

   6:18 Saith the Lord Almighty [legei Kurios pantokratOr]. 2Sa 7:8. This
   use of [eis] is a Hebraism for Hebrew le instead of predicate
   nominative. [PantokratOr] [pas, krateO], Ruler of all) is common in the
   LXX. Occurs also in the inscriptions and papyri. In the N.T. only here
   and in Revelation.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 7

   7:1 These promises [tautas tas epaggelias]. So many and so precious
   (2Pe 2:4 [epaggelmata]; Heb 11:39f.). Let us cleanse ourselves
   [katharisOmen heautous]. Old Greek used [kathairO] (in N.T. only in Joh
   15:2, to prune). In Koine [katharizO] occurs in inscriptions for
   ceremonial cleansing (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 216f.). Paul
   includes himself in this volitive aorist subjunctive. From all
   defilement [apo pantos molusmou]. Ablative alone would have done, but
   with [apo] it is plainer as in Heb 9:14. [Molusmos] is a late word from
   [molunO], to stain (see on 1Co 8:7), to pollute. In the LXX, Plutarch,
   Josephus. It includes all sorts of filthiness, physical, moral, mental,
   ceremonial, "of flesh and spirit." Missionaries in China and India can
   appreciate the atmosphere of pollution in Corinth, for instance.
   Perfecting holiness [epitelountes hagiosunen]. Not merely negative
   goodness (cleansing), but aggressive and progressive (present tense of
   [epiteleO] holiness, not a sudden attainment of complete holiness, but
   a continuous process (1Th 3:13; Ro 1:4; 1:6).

   7:2 Open your hearts to us [chOresate hemas]. Old verb (from [chOros],
   place), to leave a space, to make a space for, and transitive here as
   in Mt 19:11. He wishes no further [stenochOria], tightness of heart, in
   them (6:12). "Make room for us in your hearts." He makes this plea to
   all, even the stubborn minority. We wronged no man [oudena edikesamen].
   A thing that every preacher ought to be able to say. Cf. 4:2; 1Th 2:3;
   Ac 20:26f. We corrupted no man [oudena ephtheiramen]. We ruined no one.
   "It may refer to money, or morals, or doctrine" (Plummer). He is
   answering the Judaizers. We took advantage of no man [oudena
   epleonektesamen]. That charge was made in Thessalonica (1Th 4:6) which
   see for this late verb and also on 2Co 2:11. He got the best of (note
   [pleon] more in the root) no one in any evil way.

   7:3 Not to condemn you [pros katakrisin ou]. "Not for condemnation."
   Late word from [katakrinO], found in Vettius Valens, and here only in
   N.T. To die together and live together [eis to sunapothanein kai
   sunzein]. "For the dying together (second aorist ingressive active
   infinitive of [sunapothneskO] and living together (present active
   infinitive)." One article [to] with both infinitives. You are in our
   hearts to share death and life.

   7:4 I overflow with joy in all our affliction [huperperisseuomai tei
   charai epi pasei tei thlipsei hemOn]. A thoroughly Pauline sentiment.
   [PerisseuO] means to overflow, as we have seen. [Huper-perisseuO] (late
   word, so far only here and Byzantine writers) is to have a regular
   flood. Vulgate superabundo.

   7:5 When we had come [elthontOn hemOn]. Genitive absolute with second
   aorist active participle of [erchomai]. Paul now returns to the
   incident mentioned in 2:12 before the long digression on the glory of
   the ministry. Had no relief [oudemian escheken anesin]. Perfect active
   indicative precisely as in 2:13 which see, "has had no relief"
   (dramatic perfect). Afflicted [thlibomenoi]. Present passive participle
   of [thlibO] as in 4:8, but with anacoluthon, for the nominative case
   agrees not with the genitive [hemOn] nor with the accusative [hemas] in
   verse 6. It is used as if a principal verb as in 9:11; 11:6; Ro 12:16
   (Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 182; Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1132-35).
   Without were fightings [exOthen machai]. Asyndeton and no copula, a
   parenthesis also in structure. Perhaps pagan adversaries in Macedonia
   (cf. 1Co 15:32). Within were fears [esOthen phoboi]. Same construction.
   "Mental perturbations" (Augustine) as in 11:28.

   7:6 Cormforteth [parakalOn]. See on 1:3-7 for this word. The lowly
   [tous tapeinous]. See on Mt 11:29. Literally, low on the ground in old
   sense (Eze 17:24). Low in condition as here; Jas 1:9. In 2Co 10:1
   regarded as abject. In this sense in papyri. "Humility as a sovereign
   grace is the creation of Christianity" (Gladstone, Life, iii, p. 466).
   By the coming [en tei parousiai]. Same use of [parousia] as in 1Co 16:7
   which see. See also 2Co 7:7; 10:10.

   7:7 Wherewith [hei]. Either locative case with preceding [en] or
   instrumental of the relative with [pareklethe] (first aorist passive
   indicative). "The manner in which Paul, so to speak, fondles this word
   [parakaleO] is most beautiful" (Vincent). In you [eph' humin]. Over
   you, upon you. Your longing [ten humOn epipothesin]. Late word from
   [epipotheO] [epi], directive, longing towards, yearning). Only here in
   N.T. Mourning [odurmon]. Old word from [oduromai], to lament. Only here
   in N.T. So that I rejoiced yet more [hOste me mallon charenai]. Result
   expressed by [hOste] and the second aorist passive infinitive of
   [chairO] with accusative of general reference.

   7:8 Though [ei kai]. If also. Paul treats it as a fact. With my epistle
   [en tei epistolei]. The one referred to in 2:3f. I do not regret it [ou
   metamelomai]. This verb really means "repent" (be sorry again) which
   meaning we have transferred to [metanoeO], to change one's mind (not to
   be sorry at all). See Mt 21:30; 27:3 for the verb [metamelomai], to be
   sorry, to regret as here. Paul is now glad that he made them sorry.
   Though I did regret [ei kai metemelomen]. Imperfect indicative in the
   concessive clause. I was in a regretful mood at first. For I see [blepO
   gar]. A parenthetical explanation of his present joy in their sorrow. B
   D do not have [gar]. The Latin Vulgate has videns (seeing) for
   [blepOn]. For a season [pros hOran]. Cf. 1Th 2:17. It was only "for an
   hour."

   7:9 Now I rejoice [nun chairO]. Now that Titus has come and told him
   the good news from Corinth (2:12f.). This was the occasion of the noble
   outburst in 2:12-6:10. Unto repentance [eis metanoian]. Note the sharp
   difference here between "sorrow" [lupe] which is merely another form of
   [metamelomai] (regret, remorse) and "repentance" [metanoia] or change
   of mind and life. It is a linguistic and theological tragedy that we
   have to go on using "repentance" for [metanoia]. But observe that the
   "sorrow" has led to "repentance" and was not Itself the repentance.
   After a godly sort [kata theon]. In God's way. "God's way as opposed to
   man's way and the devil's way" (Plummer). It was not mere sorrow, but a
   change in their attitude that counted. That ye might suffer loss by us
   in nothing [hina en medeni zemiOthete ex humOn]. Purpose clause with
   [hina] and first aorist passive subjunctive of [zemioO], old verb to
   suffer damage. See on Mt 16:26. This was God's intention and so he
   overruled their sorrow to good.

   7:10 For godly sorrow [he gar kata theon lupe]. "For the sorrow
   according to God" (God's ideal, verse 9). Worketh repentance unto
   salvation a repentance without regret [metanoian eis sOterian
   ametameleton ergazetai]. This clause alone should have prevented the
   confusion between mere "sorrow" [lupe] as indicated in [metamelomai],
   to regret (to be sorry again) and "change of mind and life" as shown by
   [metanoian] [metanoeO] and wrongly translated "repentance." The sorrow
   according to God does work this "change of mind and life" unto
   salvation, a change "not to be regretted" [ametameleton], an old verbal
   adjective of [metamelomai] and [a] privative, but here alone in N.T.).
   It agrees with [metanoian], not [sOterian]. But the sorrow of the world
   [he de tou kosmou lupe]. In contrast, the kind of sorrow that the world
   has, grief "for failure, not for sin" (Bernard), for the results as
   seen in Cain, Esau (his tears!), and Judas (remorse, [metemelethe].
   Works out (perfective use of [kat-] death in the end.

   7:11 This selfsame thing [auto touto]. "This very thing," "the being
   made sorry according to God" [to kata theon lupethenai], articular
   first aorist passive infinitive with which [auto touto] agrees and the
   proleptic subject of the verb [kateirgasato]. Earnest care [spouden].
   Diligence, from [speudO], to hasten. Cf. Ro 12:11. Yea [alla]. Not
   adversative use of [alla], but copulative as is common (half dozen
   examples here). Clearing of yourselves [apologia]. In the old notion of
   [apologia] (self-vindication, self-defence) as in 1Pe 3:15. Indignation
   [aganaktesin]. Old word, only here in N.T. From [aganakteo] (Mr 10:14,
   etc.). Avenging [ekdikesin]. Late word from [ekdikeO], to avenge, to do
   justice (Lu 18:5; 21:22), vindication from wrong as in Lu 18:7, to
   secure punishment (1Pe 2:14). Pure [hagnous]. Kin to [hagios] [hazO],
   to reverence), immaculate.

   7:12 But that your earnest care for us might be made manifest [all'
   heineken tou phanerOthenai ten spouden humOn ten huper hemOn]. So the
   correct text, not "our care for you." Easy to interchange Greek [humOn]
   (your) and [hemOn] (our). Usual construction with preposition [heneken]
   and genitive of articular infinitive with accusative of general
   reference.

   7:13 We joyed the more exceedingly [perissoterOs mallon echaremen].
   Double comparative (pleonastic use of [mallon], more, with
   [perissoterOs], more abundantly) as is common in the Koine (Mr 7:36;
   Php 1:23). For the joy of Titus [epi tei charai Titou]. On the basis of
   [epi] the joy of Titus who was proud of the outcome of his labours in
   Corinth. Hath been refreshed [anapepautai]. Perfect passive indicative
   of [anapauO]. Cf. 1Co 16:18 for this striking verb.

   7:14 If--I have gloried [ei--kekauchemai]. Condition of first class. On
   this verb see 1Co 3:21; 2Co 5:12. I was not put to shame [ou
   kateischunthen]. First aorist passive indicative of [kataischunO]. Paul
   had assured Titus, who hesitated to go after the failure of Timothy,
   that the Corinthians were sound at bottom and would come round all
   right if handled properly. Paul's joy is equal to that of Titus. In
   truth [en aletheiai]. In the sharp letter as well as in I Corinthians.
   He had not hesitated to speak plainly of their sins. Our glorying
   before Titus [he kauchesis epi Titou]. The two things were not
   inconsistent and were not contradictory as the outcome proved.

   7:15 Whilst he remembereth [anamimneskomenou]. Present middle
   participle of [anamimneskO], to remind, in the genitive case agreeing
   with [autou] (his, of him). The obedience of you all [ten pantOn humOn
   hupakouen]. A remarkable statement of the complete victory of Titus in
   spite of a stubborn minority still opposing Paul. With fear and
   trembling [meta phobou kai tromou]. He had brought a stern message (1Co
   5:5) and they had trembled at the words of Titus (cf. Eph 6:5; Php
   2:12). Paul had himself come to the Corinthians at first with a nervous
   dread (1Co 2:3).

   7:16 I am of good courage [tharrO]. The outcome has brought joy,
   courage, and hope to Paul.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 8

   8:1 The grace [ten charin]. As manifested in the collection in the
   churches, poor as they were. The Romans had lacerated Macedonia (Livy,
   XLV. 30).

   8:2 Proof [dokimei]. Tests as of metals as in 2:9. Abundance
   [perisseia]. Late word from [perisseuO], to overflow. Their deep
   poverty [he kata bathous ptOcheia autOn]. [PtOcheia] is old word from
   [ptOcheuO], to be a beggar, as of Jesus in 8:9 (from [ptOchos],
   cowering in fear and poverty, as in Lu 14:13, but ennobled by Christ as
   in Mt 5:3; 2Co 8:9). Poverty down deep. Strabo (LX 419) has [kata
   bathous], down to the bottom. Liberality [haplotetos]. From [haplous],
   single, simple (Mt 6:22). "The passage from single-mindedness or
   simplicity to liberality is not quite obvious" (Plummer). Perhaps
   "heartiness" supplies the connecting link. See also 9:11-13.

   8:3 Beyond their power [para dunamin]. "Alongside" with accusative like
   [huper dunamin] in 1:8. Field (Ot. Nov.) quotes Josephus (Ant. iii. 6,
   1) for [kata dunamin] and [para dunamin] as here. Few give [kata
   dunamin] (according to actual ability). Paul commends this high
   pressure collection because of the emergency. Of their own accord
   [authairetoi]. Old verbal adjective [autos, hairetos] from [haireomai],
   to choose), of their own initiative, voluntary. Only here and verse 17
   in N.T. Papyri often have [hekousiOs kai authairetOs] (willingly and
   voluntarily).

   8:4 Beseeching us with much intreaty in regard of this grace [meta
   polles parakleseOs deomenoi hemOn ten charin]. Literally, "with much
   intreaty begging of us the favour and the partnership in the ministry
   to the saints." The accusative [charin] after [deomai] is unusual. By
   [charis] Paul means the privilege of giving (cf. Ac 24:27). Apparently
   Paul had been reluctant to press the Macedonians because of their
   manifest poverty. They demanded the right to have a share in it.

   8:5 We had hoped [elpisamen]. First aorist active indicative of
   [elpizO]. "Expected," he means. They went beyond his hopes about them.
   First they gave their own selves [heautous edOkan prOton]. First aorist
   active indicative of [didOmi] (k aorist). "Themselves they gave first."
   That is the explanation of the generous giving.

   8:6 Insomuch that we exhorted Titus [eis to parakalesai hemas Titon].
   Use of [eis to] and the infinitive for result with accusative of
   general reference [hemas]. See Robertson, Grammar, p. 1003. He had made
   a beginning before [proenerxato]. First aorist active indicative of the
   double compound verb [pro-en-archomai], still found only here and verse
   10, to make a start before others. Complete [epitelesei] First aorist
   (effective) active subjunctive of [epiteleO], to finish, with
   perfective use of [epi] in composition.

   8:7 In this grace also [kai en tautei tei chariti]. This gifted church
   (1Co 12-14) had fallen behind in the grace of giving. Kindly irony in
   this allusion.

   8:8 Proving [dokimazOn]. Testing and so proving. The sincerity also of
   your love [kai to tes humeteras agapes gnesion]. Old adjective,
   contraction of [genesios] [ginomai], legitimately born, not spurious. A
   collection is a test of one's love for Christ, not the only test, but a
   real one.

   8:9 Though he was rich [plousios On]. Concessive present participle
   [On] from [eimi], to be. Be became poor [eptOcheusen]. Ingressive
   aorist active indicative of [ptOcheuO] (see verse 2 on [ptOcheia].
   Through his poverty [tei ekeinou ptOcheiai]. Instrumental case, by
   means of. Might become rich [ploutesete]. Ingressive first aorist
   active subjunctive of [plouteO], to be rich with [hina] (that). See on
   Lu 1:53; 1Co 4:8.

   8:10 Judgment [gnOmen]. Deliberate opinion, but not a "command"
   [epitage] verse 8). Cf. 1Co 7:25. A year ago [apo perusi] From last
   year. Not only to do, but also to will [ou monon to poiesai, alla kai
   to thelein]. Articular infinitives the objects of [proenerxasthe] on
   which verb see verse 6). That is to say, the Corinthians promised
   before any others.

   8:11 The readiness to will [he prothumia tou thelein]. Old word from
   [prothumos] [pro, thumos], forwardness, eagerness (Ac 17:11). They were
   quick to pledge. The completion also [kai to epitelesai]. The finishing
   also (articular first aorist active infinitive). Out of your ability
   [ek tou echein]. "Out of the having," literally, and so, "out of what
   you can give" (verse 12).

   8:12 Is there [prokeitai]. Lies before one. Old word. Acceptable
   [euprosdektos]. See on 6:2. According as a man hath [katho ean echei].
   Indefinite comparative clause with [ean] and present subjunctive
   [echei]. Clearly God does not expect us to give what we do not have.
   Not according as he hath not [ou katho ouk echei]. Note present
   indicative rather than subjunctive because a specific case is
   presented. See 9:7; Mr 12:43.

   8:13 Others may be eased [allois anesis]. "Release to others." Ye
   distressed [humin thlipsis]. "To you tribulation." The verb [ei]
   (present subjunctive) with [hina] is not expressed.

   8:14 By equality [ex isotetos]. Old word from [isos], fair, equal. In
   N.T. only here and Col 4:1. Abundancy [perisseuma]. Late word from
   [perisseuO] like [perisseia] (verse 2) Cf. Mt 12:34. Want [husterema].
   Late word from [hustereO], to be in want. See also 9:12; Lu 21:4 (cf.
   [husteresis] in Mr 12:44).

   8:16 Which putteth [tOi didonti]. Present active articular participle,
   "who is continually giving." Hence Titus is full of zealous care for
   you.

   8:17 Very earnest [spoudaioteros]. "More earnest than ordinarily,"
   comparative adjective.

   8:18 We have sent with him [sunepempsamen met' autou]. Epistolary
   aorist. The brother [ton adelphon]. This may be, probably is, Luke who
   may also be the brother of Titus (see also 12:18) according to a common
   Greek idiom where the article is used as "his." But this idiom is not
   necessary. As a matter of fact, we do not know who this brother is. Is
   spread through all the churches [dia pasOn tOn ekklesiOn]. No verb in
   the Greek (ellipsis).

   8:19 But who was also appointed [alla kai cheirotonetheis].
   Anacoluthon. The first aorist passive participle [cheirotonetheis] is
   from [cheirotoneO], old verb to stretch out the hands [cheir teinO] and
   so to vote in public. The idea is that this brother was chosen by the
   churches, not by Paul. Only here in N.T. save Ac 14:23 where it means
   to appoint without notion of raising the hands. In Ac 10:41 we have
   [procheirotoneO]. To travel with us [sunekdemos]. Late word for
   travelling companion. So in the inscriptions [sun], together with,
   [ekdemos], away from home).

   8:20 Avoiding this [stellomenoi touto]. Present middle participle of
   [stellO], old verb, to set, to arrange. So "arranging for ourselves
   this." That any man should blame us [me tis hemas mOmesetai].
   Literally, "lest any one blame us" (negative purpose with [me] and
   first aorist middle subjunctive of [mOmeomai]. See on 6:3, only other
   N.T. example). Bounty [hadroteti]. Old word from [hadros], thick,
   stout, ripe, rich, great as in 1Ki 1:9; 2Ki 10:6. Only here in N.T.

   8:21 We take thought [pronoumen]. Old verb, to plan beforehand [pro-]
   as in Ro 12:17; 1Ti 5:8. But also in the sight of men [alla kai enOpion
   anthrOpOn]. It is not enough for one's financial accounts to be
   honourable [kala] as God sees them, but they should be so kept that men
   can understand them also. A timely warning. Paul took the utmost pains
   that no suspicion could be attached to him in this collection.

   8:22 Our brother [ton adelphon hemOn]. Not Paul's personal brother, but
   a brother in Christ, one whom Paul had tested and was willing to trust.
   It may have been Tychicus or Apollos, but we do not know.

   8:23 About Titus [huper Titou]. There is no verb expressed. Supply
   "inquire." He endorses Titus up to the hilt. He is "my partner"
   [koinOnos emos] and "fellow-worker" [sunergos]. Messengers of the
   churches [apostoloi ekklesiOn]. Apostles in the general sense of "sent
   ones" (from [apostellO], to send) by the churches and responsible to
   the churches for the handling of the funds. The glory of Christ [doxa
   Christou]. Financial agents, please observe.

   8:24 The proof of your love [ten endeixin tes agapes humOn]. There is a
   word here for pastors and deacons who try to protect the churches from
   the denominational representatives of kingdom causes. In the face of
   the churches [eis prosOpon tOn ekklesiOn]. A great host is pictured as
   watching how the Corinthians will treat these duly accredited agents in
   the collection (Titus and the other two brethren). It requires courage
   to stand by such representatives of great causes before stingy saints.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 9

   9:1 Superfluous [perisson]. All the same he does write. "The writing"
   [to graphein] ought to be superfluous.

   9:2 I glory [kauchOmai]. Present middle indicative. I still am
   glorying, in spite of the poor performance of the Corinthians. Hath
   been prepared [pareskeuastai]. Perfect passive indicative of
   [paraskeuazO], to make ready, "stands prepared." Stirred up [erethise].
   First aorist active indicative of [erethizO] (from [erethO], to
   excite), to excite in a good sense here, in a bad sense in Col 3:21,
   the only N.T. examples. Very many of them [tous pleionas]. The more,
   the majority.

   9:3 I sent [epempsa]. Not literary plural with this epistolary aorist
   as in 18, 22. That ye may be prepared [hina pareskeuasmenoi ete].
   Perfect passive subjunctive in the final clause, "that ye may really be
   prepared," "as I said" [kathOs elegon] and not just say that ye are
   prepared. Paul's very syntax tells against them.

   9:4 If there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared [ean
   elthOsin sun emoi Makedones kai heurOsin humas aparaskeuastous].
   Condition of third class (undetermined, but stated as a lively
   possibility) with [ean] and the second aorist active subjunctive
   [elthOsin, heurOsin], a bold and daring challenge. [Aparaskeuastos] is
   a late and rare verbal adjective from [paraskeuazO] with [a] privative,
   only here in the N.T. Lest by any means we should be put to shame [me
   pOs kataischunthOmen hemeis]. Negative purpose with first aorist
   passive subjunctive of [kataischunO] (see on 7:14) in the literary
   plural. That we say not, ye [hina me legOmen humeis]. A delicate
   syntactical turn for what he really has in mind. He does wish that they
   become ashamed of not paying their pledges. Confidence [hupostasei].
   This word, common from Aristotle on, comes from [huphistemi], to place
   under. It always has the notion of substratum or foundation as here;
   11:17; Heb 1:3. The papyri give numerous examples (Moulton and
   Milligan's Vocabulary) of the word for "property" in various aspects.
   So in Heb 11:1 "faith is the title-deed of things hoped for." In the
   LXX it represents fifteen different Hebrew words.

   9:5 I thought [hegesamen]. Epistolary aorist again. See Php 2:25 for
   the expression here. Go before [proelthOsin]. Second aorist active of
   [proerchomai]. Go to you before I come. Make up beforehand
   [prokatartisOsi]. Late and rare double compound verb [prokatartizO] (in
   Hippocrates). Only here in N.T. See [katartizO] in 1Co 1:10. Your
   afore-promised bounty [ten proepeggelmenen eulogian humOn]. "Blessing"
   [eulogia] literally, but applied to good deeds also as well as good
   words (Ge 33:11). Note third use of "pro" before. He literally rubs it
   in that the pledge was overdue. That the same might be ready [tauten
   hetoimen einai]. Here the infinitive alone [einai] is used to express
   purpose without [hOste] or [eis to] or [pros to] with the accusative of
   general reference [tauten]. The feminine form [hetoimen] is regular
   (1Pe 1:5) though [hetoimos] also occurs with the feminine like the
   masculine (Mt 25:10). And not of extortion [kai me hOs pleonexian].
   "And not as covetousness." Some offerings exhibit covetousness on the
   part of the giver by their very niggardliness.

   9:6 Sparingly [pheidomenOs]. Late and rare adverb made from the present
   middle participle [pheidomenos] from [pheidomai], to spare. It occurs
   in Plutarch (Alex. 25).

   9:7 He hath purposed [proeiretai]. Perfect middle indicative of
   [proaireomai], to choose beforehand, old verb, here only in N.T.
   Permanent purpose also. Not grudgingly [me ek lupes]. The use of [me]
   rather than [ou] shows that the imperative [poieitO] (do) or [didotO]
   (give) is to be supplied. Not give as out of sorrow. Or of necessity [e
   ex anagkes]. As if it were like pulling eye-teeth. For God loveth a
   cheerful giver [hilaron gar doten agapai ho theos]. Our word
   "hilarious" comes from [hilaron] which is from [hilaos] (propitious),
   an old and common adjective, only here in N.T.

   9:8 Is able [dunatei]. Late verb, not found except here; 13:3; Ro 14:4.
   So far a Pauline word made from [dunatos], able. All sufficiency [pasan
   autarkeian]. Old word from [autarkes] (Php 4:11), common word, in N.T.
   only here and 1Ti 6:6). The use of this word shows Paul's acquaintance
   with Stoicism. Paul takes this word of Greek philosophy and applies it
   to the Christian view of life as independent of circumstances. But he
   does not accept the view of the Cynics in the avoidance of society.
   Note threefold use of "all" here [en panti, pantote, pasan], in
   everything, always, all sufficiency).

   9:9 As it is written [kathOs gegraptai]. Ps 92:3,9. Picture of the
   beneficent man. He hath scattered abroad [eskorpisen]. First aorist
   active indicative of [skorpizO], to scatter, Koine verb for
   [skedannumi] of the Attic. Probably akin to [skorpios] (scorpion) from
   root [skarp], to cut asunder. See on Mt 12:30. It is like sowing seed.
   To the poor [tois penesin]. Old word from [penamai], to work for one's
   living. Latin penuria and Greek [peinaO], to be hungry, are kin to it.
   Only N.T. instance and to be distinguished from [ptOchos], beggar,
   abjectly poor.

   9:10 Supplieth [epichoregOn]. Late Koine compound verb from [epi] and
   [choregeO], just below (1Pe 4:11). [Choregos] is old word for leader of
   a chorus [choros, hegeomai] or chorus-leader. The verb means to furnish
   a chorus at one's own expense, then to supply in general. N.T. examples
   of [epichoregeO] are 2Co 9:10; Ga 3:15; Col 2:19; 2Pe 1:5. Shall
   multiply [plethunei]. Future active indicative of [plethunO], old verb
   from [plethus], fulness. Cf. Ac 6:1. Fruits [genemata]. Correct reading
   (from [ginomai], to become) and not [gennemata] (from [gennaO], to
   beget). This spelling is supported by LXX where Thackeray shows that
   [genemata] in LXX refers to vegetables and [gennemata] to animals. The
   papyri support this distinction (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary).

   9:11 Enriched [ploutizomenoi]. Present passive participle of [ploutizO]
   for which see on 1Co 1:5; 2Co 6:10 only other N.T. examples. Liberality
   [haploteta]. See on 8:2. Anacoluthon with nominative participle too far
   from [perisseuete] for agreement. More like the independent use of the
   participle.

   9:12 Service [leitourgias]. Old word from [leOs] (people, [laos],
   [leitos] like [demosios], public, and [ergon], work. So public service
   either in worship to God (Lu 1:23) or benefaction to others (2Co 9:12;
   Php 2:30). Our word liturgy is this word. Filleth up [estin
   prosanaplerousa]. Present active periphrastic indicative of double
   compound verb [prosanapleroO], Koine word, here and 11:9 only in N.T.,
   to fill up by adding to. The Corinthians simply added to the total from
   others. Unto God [tOi theOi]. Dative case and with a certain suddenness
   as at close of verse 11, really a parenthesis between in the somewhat
   tangled sentence.

   9:13 Seeing that they glorify God [doxazontes ton theon]. Anacoluthon
   again. The nominative participle used independently like
   [ploutizomenoi] in verse 11. Obedience [hupotagei]. Late and rare word
   from [hupotassO], to subject, middle to obey. Only in Paul in N.T. Of
   your confession [tes homologias humOn]. Old word from [homologeO]
   [homologos, homou, legO], to say together. It is either to profess
   (Latin profiteor, to declare openly) or to confess (Latin confiteor, to
   declare fully, to say the same thing as another). Both confess and
   profess are used to translate the verb and each idea is present in the
   substantive. Only the context can decide. Actions speak louder than
   words. The brethren in Jerusalem will know by this collection that
   Gentiles make as good Christians as Jews. For the liberality of your
   contribution [haploteti tes koinOnias]. This is the point that matters
   just now. Paul drives it home. On this use of [koinOnia] see on 8:4.

   9:14 While they themselves long after you [autOn epipothountOn].
   Genitive absolute of present active participle of [epipotheO] (5:2). In
   you [eph' humin]. Upon you.

   9:15 Thanks be to God [charis tOi theOi]. Third time (verses 11, 12,
   15). For his unspeakable gift [epi tei anekdiegetOi autou dOreai]. One
   of Paul's gems flashed out after the somewhat tangled sentence (verses
   10-14) like a gleam of light that clears the air. Words fail Paul to
   describe the gift of Christ to and for us. He may have coined this word
   as it is not found elsewhere except in ecclesiastical writers save as a
   variant (B L) for [adiegeton] in Aristeas 99 [thaumasmon anekdiegeton],
   "wonder beyond description," Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary). See
   similar word in Ro 11:33 [anexichniasta], unsearchable) and Eph 3:8.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 10

   10:1 Now I Paul myself [Autos de egO Paulos]. Cf. Ga 5:2. Paul now
   turns to the third part of the epistle in chapters 10-13 in which he
   vigorously defends himself against the accusations of the stubborn
   minority of Judaizers in Corinth. Great ministers of Christ through the
   ages have had to pass through fiery trials like these. Paul has shown
   the way for us all. He speaks of himself now plainly, but under
   compulsion, as is clear. It may be that at this point he took the pen
   from the amanuensis and wrote himself as in Ga 6:11. By the meekness
   and gentleness of Christ [dia tes prautetos kai epieikias tou
   Christou]. This appeal shows (Plummer) that Paul had spoken to the
   Corinthians about the character of Christ. Jesus claimed meekness for
   himself (Mt 11:29) and felicitated the meek (Mt 5:5) and he exemplified
   it abundantly (Lu 23:34). See on Mt 5:15; 1Co 4:21 for this great word
   that has worn thin with us. Plutarch combines [prautes] with [epieikia]
   as Paul does here. Matthew Arnold suggested "sweet reasonableness" for
   [epieikeia] in Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch. It is in the N.T. only here
   and Ac 24:4 [to epieikes] in Php 4:5). In Greek Ethics the equitable
   man was called [epieikes], a man who does not press for the last
   farthing of his rights (Bernard). Lowly among you [tapeinos en humin].
   The bad use of [tapeinos], the old use, but here alone in N.T. in that
   meaning. Socrates and Aristotle used it for littleness of soul.
   Probably Paul here is quoting one of the sneers of his traducers in
   Corinth about his humble conduct while with them (1Co 2:23; 2Co 7:6)
   and his boldness [apOn tharrO] when away (1Co 7:16). "It was easy to
   satirize and misrepresent a depression of spirits, a humility of
   demeanour, which were either the direct results of some bodily
   affliction, or which the consciousness of this affliction had rendered
   habitual" (Farrar). The words stung Paul to the quick.

   10:2 I beseech [deomai]. So here, but [parakalO] in verse 1. Perhaps,
   "I beg" suits the new turn here. That I may not when present show
   courage [to me parOn tharresai]. Articular infinitive (aorist active of
   [tharreO] in the accusative case with negative [me] the direct object
   of [deomai]. Literally, "I beg the not when present [parOn] nominative
   present participle agreeing with subject of [tharrO] in spite of being
   in the accusative infinitive clause, [to me tharresai] showing
   courage." The example of humility in Christ makes Paul drop "from
   magisterial exhortation to earnest entreaty" (Plummer). As if we walked
   according to the flesh [hOs kata sarka peripatountas]. Another sneering
   charge as made plain by the use of [hOs] with the participle for the
   alleged reason.

   10:3 In the flesh [en sarki]. But that is a very different thing from
   walking [kata sarka] according to the standards of the flesh as his
   enemies charged. It is easy enough to make insinuations. We war
   [strateuometha]. Literary plural again after [logizomai] in verse 2.
   Old word to lead an army [stratos]. In N.T. only in the middle as here.
   Paul admits that he fights, but only the devil and his agents even if
   wearing the livery of heaven. Paul knew the Roman army well. He knows
   how to use the military metaphor.

   10:4 The weapons of our warfare [ta hopla tes strateias]. [Strateia]
   (old word, in N.T. only here and 1Ti 1:18) is campaign and not army as
   some MSS. have [stratia]. But both [strateia] and [stratia] occur in
   the papyri for the same word (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 181f.). For
   [hopla] (Latin arma) see on 6:7; Rom 6:13; 13:12. Of the flesh
   [sarkika]. See on 1Co 3:3; 2Co 1:12. They had accused him of artifices
   and craft. Mighty before God [dunata tOi theOi]. This dative of
   personal interest (ethical dative) can be like [asteios tOi theOi] (Ac
   7:20), in God's eyes, as it looks to God. To the casting down of
   strongholds [pros kathairesin ochurOmatOn]. [Kathairesis] is old word
   from [kathaireO], to take down, to tear down walls and buildings.
   Carries on the military metaphor. [OchurOma] is old word, common in the
   Apocrypha, from [ochuroO], to fortify, and that from [ochuros] (from
   [echO], to hold fast). Nowhere else in N.T. In Cilicia the Romans had
   to tear down many rocky forts in their attacks on the pirates.

   10:5 Casting down imaginations [logismous kathairountes]. The same
   military figure [kathairesis] and the present active participle
   agreeing with [strateuometha] in verse 3 (verse 4 a parenthesis). The
   reasonings or imaginations [logismous], old word from [logizomai], to
   reckon, only here in N.T. and Ro 2:15) are treated as forts or citadels
   to be conquered. Every high thing that is exalted [pan hupsOma
   epairomenon]. Same metaphor. [HupsOma] from [hupsoO] is late Koine word
   (in LXX, Plutarch, Philo, papyri) for height and that figure carried on
   by [epairomenon]. Paul aims to pull down the top-most perch of audacity
   in their reasonings against the knowledge of God. We need Paul's skill
   and courage today. Bringing every thought into captivity
   [aichmalOtizontes pan noema]. Present active participle of
   [aichmalOtizO], common Koine verb from [aichmalOtos], captive in war
   [aichme], spear, [halOtos] verbal of [haliskomai], to be taken). See on
   Lu 21:24. Paul is the most daring of thinkers, but he lays all his
   thoughts at the feet of Jesus. For [noema] (device) see on 2:11. To the
   obedience of Christ [eis ten hupakoen tou Christou]. Objective
   genitive, "to the obedience unto Christ." That is Paul's conception of
   intellectual liberty, freedom in Christ. Deissmann (St. Paul, p. 141)
   calls this "the mystic genitive."

   10:6 Being in readiness [en hetoimOi echontes]. This very idiom occurs
   in Polybius, Philo, etc. "Holding in readiness." In 12:14 we have
   [hetoimOs echO] for the same idea (adverb [hetoimOs]. Disobedience
   [parakoen]. Rare word (Plato, papyri) hearing amiss (aside), failing to
   hear, refusing to heed (cf. Mt 18:17 for same idea in [parakouO]. In
   N.T. only here; Ro 5:19; Heb 2:2. In contrast with [hupakoe]
   (obedience) rather than the common [apeithia] (Ro 11:30,32). When your
   obedience shall be fulfilled [hotan plerOthei humOn he hupakoe].
   Indefinite temporal clause with [hotan] and first aorist passive
   subjunctive. Paul expects that the whole church will become obedient to
   Christ's will soon as came true.

   10:7 Ye look [Blepete]. Either indicative or imperative. Either makes
   sense but the indicative the best sense. Before your face [kata
   prosOpon]. They ought to look below the surface. If it is imperative,
   they should see the facts. That he is Christ's [Christou einai].
   Predicate genitive in indirect discourse).

   10:8 Somewhat abundantly [perissoteron ti]. Comparative, "somewhat more
   abundantly" than I have, in order to show that he is as true a minister
   of Christ as his accusers are. Concessive (conditional) clause of third
   class. For [ean te] see Ro 14:8. I shall not be put to shame [ouk
   aischunthesomai]. As a convicted impostor or pretentious boaster
   (Plummer). First future passive, singular number (not literary plural
   as in verse 7).

   10:9 As if I would terrify you by my letters [hOs an ekphobein humas
   dia tOn epistolOn]. This use of [hOs an] with the infinitive is seen in
   the papyri (Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 167) and it is not [an] in the
   apodosis (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 974, 1040). The active of this old
   compound verb means to frighten, to terrify. Here only in N.T. It is
   common in the LXX (Job 7:14; 33:16). Note plural (letters) here and cf.
   1Co 5:9; 2Co 2:3.

   10:10 They say [phasin]. Reading of B old Latin Vulgate, but Westcott
   and Hort prefer [phesin] (says one, the leader). This charge Paul
   quotes directly. Weighty and strong [bareiai kai ischurai]. These
   adjectives can be uncomplimentary and mean "severe and violent" instead
   of "impressive and vigorous." The adjectives bear either sense. His
   bodily presence [he parousia tou sOmatos]. This certainly is
   uncomplimentary. "The presence of his body." It seems clear that Paul
   did not have a commanding appearance like that of Barnabas (Ac 14:12).
   He had some physical defect of the eyes (Ga 4:14) and a thorn in the
   flesh (2Co 12:7). In the second century Acts of Paul and Thecla he is
   pictured as small, short, bow-legged, with eye-brows knit together, and
   an aquiline nose. A forgery of the fourth century in the name of Lucian
   describes Paul as "the bald-headed, hook-nosed Galilean." However that
   may be, his accusers sneered at his personal appearance as "weak"
   [asthenes]. His speech of no account [ho logos exouthenemenos]. Perfect
   passive participle of [exoutheneO], to treat as nothing (cf. 1Co 1:28).
   The Corinthians (some of them) cared more for the brilliant eloquence
   of Apollos and did not find Paul a trained rhetorician (1Co 1:17;
   2:1,4; 2Co 11:6). He made different impressions on different people.
   "Seldom has any one been at once so ardently hated and so passionately
   loved as St. Paul" (Deissmann, St. Paul, p. 70). "At one time he seemed
   like a man, and at another he seemed like an angel" (Acts of Paul and
   Thecla). He spoke like a god at Lystra (Ac 14:8-12), but Eutychus went
   to sleep on him (Ac 20:9). Evidently Paul winced under this biting
   criticism of his looks and speech.

   10:11 What we are [hoioi esmen]. Rather, "what sort" [hoioi], not [ho]
   (what) nor [hoi] (who). Literary plural. [Hoios] is qualitative just as
   [toioutoi] (such). Paul's quality in his letters when absent [apontes]
   and in his deeds when present [parontes] is precisely the same.

   10:12 To number or compare ourselves [enkrinai e sunkrinai].
   Paronomasia here, play on the two words. [Enkrinai] is first aorist
   active infinitive of old verb, but here only in N.T., to judge among,
   to judge one as worthy to be numbered among as here. The second verb
   [sunkrinai] (first aorist active infinitive of [sunkrinO], old verb, in
   N.T. only here and 1Co 2:13) originally meant to combine as in 1Co 2:13
   (which see), but here it has the sense of "compare" not found in the
   old Greek. The papyri use it to mean to decide. Plummer suggests "to
   pair and compare" for the play on the words here. Measuring themselves
   by themselves [en heautois heautous metrountes]. Or "in themselves."
   Keenest sarcasm. Setting themselves up as the standards of orthodoxy
   these Judaizers always measure up to the standard while Paul falls
   short. Comparing themselves with themselves [sunkrinontes heautous
   heautois]. Associate instrumental case [heautois] after [sunkrinontes]
   (verb just explained). Paul is not keen to fall into the trap set for
   him. Are without understanding [ou suniasin]. The regular form for
   present active indicative third plural of [suniemi], to comprehend, to
   grasp. Some MSS. have the late form [suniousin] (omega form [suniO]. It
   is a hard thing to see, but it is true. These men do not see their own
   picture so obvious to others (Eph 5:17; 1Ti 1:7). Cf. Mr 8:17.

   10:13 Beyond our measure [eis ta ametra]. "Into the unmeasured things,"
   "the illimitable." Old word, here only in N.T. Of the province [tou
   kanonos]. Old word [kanna] like Hebrew) a reed, a measuring rod.
   Numerous papyri examples for measuring rod and rules (our word canon).
   Only twice in N.T., here (also verse 15, 16) and Ga 6:16 (rule to walk
   by). To reach even unto you [ephikesthai achri kai humOn]. Second
   aorist middle infinitive of [ephikneomai], old verb, only here and
   verse 14 in N.T. Paul's measuring-rod extends to Corinth.

   10:14 We stretch not ourselves overmuch [ou huperekteinomen heautous].
   Apparently Paul made this double compound verb to express his full
   meaning (only in Gregory Nazianzen afterwards). "We do not stretch
   ourselves out beyond our rights." We came even as far as unto you
   [achri kai humOn ephthasamen]. First aorist active indicative of
   [phthanO], to come before, to precede, the original idea which is
   retained in Mt 12:28 (Lu 11:20) and may be so here. If so, it means "We
   were the first to come to you" (which is true, Ac 18:1-18).

   10:15 In other men's labours [en allotriois kopois]. [Allotrios] means
   belonging to another as in Lu 16:12. Paul founded the church in
   Corinth. As your faith groweth [auxanomenes tes pisteOs]. Genitive
   absolute of the present passive participle of [auxanO], to grow. We
   shall be magnified [megalunthenai]. First aorist passive infinitive of
   [megalunO], old verb (Lu 1:46) to make great (cf. Php 1:20 of Christ).
   Indirect discourse after [elpida] (hope) with the construction of
   [elpizO], to hope.

   10:16 Even unto the parts beyond you [eis ta huperekeina humOn].
   Compound adverb [huper, ekeina], beyond those places) used as
   preposition. Found only here and in ecclesiastical writers. Things
   ready to our hand [ta hetoima]. He had a plenty besides that he could
   use.

   10:17 Paul quotes Pr 27:2.

   10:18 Is approved [dokimos]. Accepted (from [dechomai] by the Lord. The
   Lord accepts his own recommendation [sunistesin], see on 2Co 3:1f.).
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 11

   11:1 Would that ye could bear with me [ophelon aneichesthe mou]. Koine
   way of expressing a wish about the present, [ophelon] (as a
   conjunction, really second aorist active indicative of [opheilO]
   without augment) and the imperfect indicative instead of [eithe] or [ei
   gar] (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1003). Cf. Re 3:15. See Ga 5:12 for future
   indicative with [ophelon] and 1Co 4:8 for aorist. [Mou] is ablative
   case after [aneichesthe] (direct middle, hold yourselves back from me).
   There is a touch of irony here. Bear with me [anechesthe mou]. Either
   imperative middle or present middle indicative (ye do bear with me).
   Same form. In a little foolishness [mikron ti aphrosunes]. Accusative
   of general reference [mikron ti]. "Some little foolishness" (from
   [aphrOn], foolish). Old word only in this chapter in N.T.

   11:2 With a godly jealousy [theou zelOi]. Instrumental case of [zelos].
   With a jealousy of God. I espoused [hermosamen]. First aorist middle
   indicative of [harmozO], old verb to join, to fit together (from
   [harmos], joint). Common for betrothed, though only here in N.T. The
   middle voice indicates Paul's interest in the matter. Paul treats the
   Corinthians as his bride.

   11:3 The serpent beguiled Eve [ho ophis exepatesen Heuan]. Paul's only
   mention of the serpent in Eden. The compound [exapataO] means to
   deceive completely. Lest by any means [me pOs]. Common conjunction
   after verbs of fearing. Corrupted [phtharei]. Second aorist passive
   subjunctive with [me pOs] of [phtheirO], to corrupt.

   11:4 Another Jesus [allon Iesoun]. Not necessarily a different Jesus,
   but any other "Jesus" is a rival and so wrong. That would deny the
   identity. A different spirit [pneuma heteron]. This is the obvious
   meaning of [heteron] in distinction from [allon] as seen in Ac 4:12; Ga
   1:6f. But this distinction in nature or kind is not always to be
   insisted on. A different gospel [euaggelion heteron]. Similar use of
   [heteron]. Ye do well to bear with him [kalOs anechesthe]. Ironical
   turn again. "Well do you hold yourselves back from him" (the coming
   one, whoever he is). Some MSS. have the imperfect [aneichesthe] (did
   bear with).

   11:5 That I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles [meden
   husterekenai tOn huperlian apostolOn]. Perfect active infinitive of
   [hustereO], old verb to fall short with the ablative case. The rare
   compound adverb [huperlian] (possibly in use in the vernacular) is
   probably ironical also, "the super apostles" as these Judaizers set
   themselves up to be. "The extra-super apostles" (Farrar). Also in
   12:11. He is not referring to the pillar-apostles of Ga 2:9.

   11:6 Rude in speech [idiOtes tOi logOi]. Locative case with [idiOtes]
   for which word see on Ac 4:13; 1Co 14:16,23,24. The Greeks regarded a
   man as [idiOtes] who just attended to his own affairs [ta idia] and
   took no part in public life. Paul admits that he is not a professional
   orator (cf. 10:10), but denies that he is unskilled in knowledge [all'
   ou tei gnOsei]. Among all men [en pasin]. He has made his mastery of
   the things of Christ plain among all men. He knew his subject.

   11:7 In abasing myself [emauton tapeinOn]. Humbling myself by making
   tents for a living while preaching in Corinth. He is ironical still
   about "doing a sin" [hamartian epoiesa]. For nought [dOrean]. Gratis.
   Accusative of general reference, common adverb. It amounts to sarcasm
   to ask if he did a sin in preaching the gospel free of expense to them
   "that ye may be exalted."

   11:8 I robbed [esulesa]. Old verb to despoil, strip arms from a slain
   foe, only here in N.T. He allowed other churches to do more than their
   share. Taking wages [labOn opsOnion]. For [opsOnion] see on 1Co 9:7; Ro
   6:17. He got his "rations" from other churches, not from Corinth while
   there.

   11:9 I was not a burden to any man [ou katenarkesa outhenos]. First
   aorist active indicative of [katanarkaO]. Jerome calls this word one of
   Paul's cilicisms which he brought from Cilicia. But the word occurs in
   Hippocrates for growing quite stiff and may be a medical term in
   popular use. [NarkaO] means to become numb, torpid, and so a burden. It
   is only here and 12:13f. Paul "did not benumb the Corinthians by his
   demand for pecuniary aid" (Vincent). From being burdensome [abare]. Old
   adjective, free from weight or light [a] privative and [baros], weight)
   . See on 1Th 2:9 for same idea. Paul kept himself independent.

   11:10 No man shall stop me of this glorying [he kauchesis haute ou
   phragesetai eis eme]. More exactly, "This glorying shall not be fenced
   in as regards me." Second future passive of [phrassO], to fence in, to
   stop, to block in. Old verb, only here in N.T. In the regions of Achaia
   [en tois klimasin tes Achaias]. [Klima] from [klinO], to incline, is
   Koine word for declivity slope, region (our climate). See chapter 1Co 9
   for Paul's boast about preaching the gospel without cost to them.

   11:11 God knoweth [ho theos oiden]. Whether they do or not. He knows
   that God understands his motives.

   11:12 That I may cut off occasion [hina ekkopsO ten aphormen]. Purpose
   clause with [hina] and first aorist active subjunctive of [ekkoptO],
   old verb to cut out or off (Mt 3:10; 5:30). See 2Co 5:12 for
   [aphormen]. From them which desire an occasion [tOn thelontOn
   aphormen]. Ablative case after [ekkopsO]. There are always some hunting
   for occasions to start something against preachers. They may be found
   [heurethOsin]. First aorist passive subjunctive of [heuriskO], to find
   with final conjunction [hina].

   11:13 False apostles [pseudapostoloi]. From [pseudes], false, and
   [apostolos]. Paul apparently made this word (cf. Re 2:2). In verse 26
   we have [pseudadelphos], a word of like formation (Ga 2:4). See also
   [pseudochristoi] and [pseudoprophetai] in Mr 13:22. Deceitful [dolioi].
   Old word from [dolos] (lure, snare), only here in N.T. (cf. Ro 16:18).
   Fashioning themselves [metaschematizomenoi]. Present middle (direct)
   participle of the old verb [metaschematizO] for which see on 1Co 4:6.
   Masquerading as apostles of Christ by putting on the outward
   habiliments, posing as ministers of Christ ("gentlemen of the cloth,"
   nothing but cloth). Paul plays with this verb in verses 13, 14, 15.

   11:14 An angel of light [aggelon phOtos]. The prince of darkness puts
   on the garb of light and sets the fashion for his followers in the
   masquerade to deceive the saints. "Like master like man." Cf. 2:11; Ga
   1:8. This terrible portrayal reveals the depth of Paul's feelings about
   the conduct of the Judaizing leaders in Corinth. In Ga 2:4 he terms
   those in Jerusalem "false brethren."

   11:15 As ministers of righteousness [hOs diakonoi dikaiosunes]. Jesus
   (Joh 10:1-21) terms these false shepherds thieves and robbers. It is a
   tragedy to see men in the livery of heaven serve the devil.

   11:16 Let no man think me foolish [me tis me doxei aphrona einai].
   Usual construction in a negative prohibition with [me] and the aorist
   subjunctive [doxei] (Robertson, Grammar, p. 933). But if ye do [ei de
   me ge]. Literally, "But if not at least (or otherwise)," that is, If
   you do think me foolish. Yet as foolish [kan hOs aphrona]. "Even if as
   foolish." Paul feels compelled to boast of his career and work as an
   apostle of Christ after the terrible picture just drawn of the
   Judaizers. He feels greatly embarrassed in doing it. Some men can do it
   with complete composure (sang froid).

   11:17 Not after the Lord [ou kata Kurion]. Not after the example of the
   Lord. He had appealed to the example of Christ in 10:1 (the meekness
   and gentleness of Christ). Paul's conduct here, he admits, is not in
   keeping with that. But circumstances force him on.

   11:18 After the flesh [kata sarka]. It is [kata sarka] not [kata
   Kurion]. I also [kagO]. But he knows that it is a bit of foolishness
   and not like Christ.

   11:19 Gladly [hedeOs]. Irony again. Cf. [kalos] in 11:4 (Mr 7:9). So as
   to [phronimoi ontes] (being wise).

   11:20 For ye bear with a man [anechesthe gar]. " You tolerate tyranny,
   extortion, craftiness, arrogance, violence, and insult" (Plummer).
   Sarcasm that cut to the bone. Note the verb with each of the five
   conditional clauses (enslaves, devours, takes captive, exalteth
   himself, smites on the face). The climax of insult, smiting on the
   face.

   11:21 By way of disparagement [kata atimian]. Intense irony. Cf. 6:8.
   As though [hOs hoti]. Presented as the charge of another. "They more
   than tolerate those who trample on them while they criticize as weak'
   one who shows them great consideration" (Plummer). After these
   prolonged explanations Paul "changes his tone from irony to direct and
   masterful assertion" (Bernard). I am bold also [tolmO kagO]. Real
   courage. Cf. 10:2, 12.

   11:22 So am I [kagO]. This is his triumphant refrain with each
   challenge.

   11:23 As one beside himself [paraphronOn]. Present active participle of
   [paraphroneO]. Old verb from [paraphrOn] [para, phren], beside one's
   wits. Only here in N.T. Such open boasting is out of accord with Paul's
   spirit and habit. I more [huper egO]. This adverbial use of [huper]
   appears in ancient Greek (Euripides). It has no effect on [egO], not
   "more than I," but "I more than they." He claims superiority now to
   these "superextra apostles." More abundant [perissoterOs]. See on 7:15.
   No verbs with these clauses, but they are clear. In prisons [en
   phulakais]. Plural also in 6:5. Clement of Rome (Cor. V.) says that
   Paul was imprisoned seven times. We know of only five (Philippi,
   Jerusalem, Caesarea, twice in Rome), and only one before II Corinthians
   (Philippi). But Luke does not tell them all nor does Paul. Had he been
   in prison in Ephesus? So many think and it is possible as we have seen.
   Above measure [huperballontOs]. Old adverb from the participle
   [huperballontOn] [huperballO], to hurl beyond). Here only in N.T. In
   deaths oft [en thanatois pollakis]. He had nearly lost his life, as we
   know, many times (1:9f.; 4:11).

   11:24 Five times received I forty stripes save one [pentakis
   tesserakonta para mian elabon]. The Acts and the Epistles are silent
   about these Jewish floggings (Mt 27:36). See on Lu 12:47 for omission
   of [plegas] (stripes). Thirty-nine lashes was the rule for fear of a
   miscount (De 25:1-3). Cf. Josephus (Ant. IV. 8, 1, 21).

   11:25 Thrice was I beaten with rods [tris errabdisthen]. Roman
   (Gentile) punishment. It was forbidden to Roman citizens by the Lex
   Porcia, but Paul endured it in Philippi (Ac 16:23,37), the only one of
   the three named in Acts. First aorist passive of [rabdizO], from
   [rabdos], rod, Koine word, in N.T. only here and Ac 16:22 which see.
   Once was I stoned [hapax elithasthen]. Once for all [hapax] means. At
   Lystra (Ac 14:5-19). On [lithazO] Koine verb from [lithos], see on Ac
   5:26. Thrice I suffered shipwreck [tris enauagesa]. First aorist active
   of [nauageO], from [nauagos], shipwrecked [naus], ship, [agnumi], to
   break). Old and common verb, in N.T. only here and 1Ti 1:19. We know
   nothing of these. The one told in Ac 27 was much later. What a pity
   that we have no data for all these varied experiences of Paul. Night
   and day [nuchthemeron] Rare word. Papyri give [nuktemar] with the same
   idea (night-day). Have I been in the deep [en tOi buthOi pepoieka].
   Vivid dramatic perfect active indicative of [poieO], "I have done a
   night and day in the deep." The memory of it survives like a nightmare.
   [Buthos] is old word (only here in N.T.) for bottom, depth of the sea,
   then the sea itself. Paul does not mean that he was a night and day
   under the water, not a Jonah experience, only that he was far out at
   sea and shipwrecked. This was one of the three shipwrecks-already
   named.

   11:26 In journeyings [hodoiporiais]. Locative case of old word, only
   here in N.T. and Joh 4:6, from [hodoiporos], wayfarer. In perils
   [kindunois]. Locative case of [kindunos], old word for danger or peril.
   In N.T. only this verse and Ro 8:35. The repetition here is very
   effective without the preposition [en] (in) and without conjunctions
   (asyndeton). They are in contrasted pairs. The rivers of Asia Minor are
   still subject to sudden swellings from floods in the mountains. Cicero
   and Pompey won fame fighting the Cilician pirates and robbers (note
   [leistOn], not [kleptOn], thieves, brigands or bandits on which see Mt
   26:55). The Jewish perils [ek genous], from my race) can be illustrated
   in Ac 9:23,29; 13:50; 14:5; 17:5,13; 18:12; 23:12; 24:27, and they were
   all perils in the city also. Perils from the Gentiles [ex ethnOn] we
   know in Philippi (Ac 16:20) and in Ephesus (Ac 19:23f.). Travel in the
   mountains and in the wilderness was perilous in spite of the great
   Roman highways. Among false brethren [en pseudadelphois]. Chapters 2Co
   10; 11 throw a lurid light on this aspect of the subject.

   11:27 In labour and travail [kopOi kai mochthOi]. Both old words for
   severe work, combined here as in 1Th 2:9; 2Th 3:8, "by toil and moil"
   (Plummer). The rest of the list is like the items in 2Co 6:4ff. In cold
   [en psuchei]. Old word from [psuchO], to cool by blowing. See Ac 28:2.
   See the picture of the aged Paul later in the Roman dungeon (2Ti
   4:9-18).

   11:28 Besides those things that are without [chOris tOn parektos].
   Probably, "apart from those things beside these just mentioned." Surely
   no man ever found glory in such a peck of troubles as Paul has here
   recounted. His list should shame us all today who are disposed to find
   fault with our lot. That which presseth upon me daily [he epistasis moi
   he kath' hemeran]. For this vivid word [epistasis] see Ac 24:12, the
   only other place in the N.T. where it occurs. It is like the rush of a
   mob upon Paul. Anxiety for all the churches [he merimna pasOn tOn
   ekklesiOn]. Objective genitive after [merimna] (distractions in
   different directions, from [merizO] for which word see on Mt 13:22.
   Paul had the shepherd heart. As apostle to the Gentiles he had founded
   most of these churches.

   11:29 I burn [puroumai]. Present passive indicative of [puroO], old
   verb to inflame (from [pur], fire). When a brother stumbles, Paul is
   set on fire with grief.

   11:30 The things that concern my weakness [ta tes astheneias mou]. Like
   the list above.

   11:31 I am not lying [ou pseudomai]. The list seems so absurd and
   foolish that Paul takes solemn oath about it (cf. 1:23). For the
   doxology see Ro 1:25; 9:5.

   11:32 The governor under Aretas [ho ethnarches Hareta]. How it came to
   pass that Damascus, ruled by the Romans after B.C. 65, came at this
   time to be under the rule of Aretas, fourth of the name, King of the
   Nabatheans (II Macc. 5:8), we do not know. There is an absence of Roman
   coins in Damascus from A.D. 34 to 62. It is suggested (Plummer) that
   Caligula, to mark his dislike for Antipas, gave Damascus to Aretas
   (enemy of Antipas). Guarded [ephrourei]. Imperfect active of
   [phroureO], old verb (from [phrouros], a guard) to guard by posting
   sentries. In Ac 9:24 we read that the Jews kept watch to seize Paul,
   but there is no conflict as they cooperated with the guard set by
   Aretas at their request. To seize [piasai]. Doric first aorist active
   infinitive of [piezO] (Lu 6:38) for which see on Ac 3:7.

   11:33 Through a window [dia thuridos]. For this late word see on Ac
   20:9, the only N.T. example. Was I let down [echalasthen]. First aorist
   passive of [chalaO], the very word used by Luke in Ac 9:25. In a basket
   [en sarganei]. Old word for rope basket whereas Luke (Ac 9:25) has [en
   sphuridi] (the word for the feeding of the 4,000 while [kophinos] is
   the one for the 5,000). This was a humiliating experience for Paul in
   this oldest city of the world whither he had started as a conqueror
   over the despised Christians.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 12

   12:1 I must needs glory [kauchasthai dei]. This is the reading of B L
   Latin Syriac, but Aleph D Bohairic have [de] while K M read [de]. The
   first is probably correct. He must go on with the glorying already
   begun, foolish as it is, though it is not expedient [ou sumpheron].
   Visions [optasias]. Late word from [optazO]. See on Lu 1:22; Ac 26:19.
   Revelations of the Lord [apokalupseis Kuriou]. Unveilings (from
   [apokaluptO] as in Re 1:1). See on 2Th 1:7; 1Co 1:7; 14:26. Paul had
   both repeated visions of Christ (Ac 9:3; 16:9; 18:9; 22:17; 27:23f.)
   and revelations. He claimed to speak by direct revelation (1Co 11:23;
   15:3; Ga 1:12; Eph 3:3, etc.).

   12:2 I know a man [oida anthrOpon]. Paul singles out one incident of
   ecstasy in his own experience that he declines to describe. He alludes
   to it in this indirect way as if it were some other personality.
   Fourteen years ago [pro etOn dekatessarOn]. Idiomatic way of putting
   it, the preposition [pro] (before) before the date (Robertson, Grammar,
   p. 621f.) as in Joh 12:1. The date was probably while Paul was at
   Tarsus (Ac 9:30; 11:25). We have no details of that period. Caught up
   [harpagenta]. Second aorist passive participle of [harpazO], to seize
   (see on Mt 11:12). Even to the third heaven [heOs tritou ouranou]. It
   is unlikely that Paul alludes to the idea of seven heavens held by some
   Jews (Test. of the Twelve Pat., Levi ii. iii.). He seems to mean the
   highest heaven where God is (Plummer).

   12:3 I do not know [ouk oida]. Paul declines to pass on his precise
   condition in this trance. We had best leave it as he has told it.

   12:4 Into Paradise [eis paradeison]. See on Lu 23:43 for this
   interesting word. Paul apparently uses paradise as the equivalent of
   the third heaven in verse 2. Some Jews (Book of the Secrets of Enoch,
   chapter viii) make Paradise in the third heaven. The rabbis had various
   ideas (two heavens, three, seven). We need not commit Paul to any
   "celestial gradation" (Vincent). Unspeakable words [arreta remata]. Old
   verbal adjective [a] privative, [retos] from [reO], only here in N.T.
   Not lawful [ouk exon]. Copula [estin] omitted. Hence Paul does not give
   these words.

   12:5 But on mine own behalf [huper de emautou]. As if there were two
   Pauls. In a sense there were. He will only glory in the things
   mentioned above, the things of his weaknesses (11:30).

   12:6 I shall not be foolish [ouk esomai aphrOn]. Apparent contradiction
   to 11:1, 16. But he is here speaking of the Paul "caught up" in case he
   should tell the things heard (condition of the third class, [ean] and
   first aorist subjunctive [thelesO]. Of me [eis eme]. To my credit,
   almost like dative (cf. [en emoi] in 1Co 14:11).

   12:7 By reason of the exceeding greatness [tei huperbolei].
   Instrumental case, "by the excess." That I should not be exalted
   overmuch [hina me huperairOmai]. Present passive subjunctive in final
   clause of [huperairO], old verb to lift up beyond, only here in N.T.
   This clause is repeated at the end of the sentence. A thorn in the
   flesh [skolops tei sarki]. This old word is used for splinter, stake,
   thorn. In the papyri and inscriptions examples occur both for splinter
   and thorn as the meaning. In the LXX it is usually thorn. The case of
   [tei sarki] can be either locative (in) or dative (for). What was it?
   Certainly it was some physical malady that persisted. All sorts of
   theories are held (malaria, eye-trouble, epilepsy, insomnia, migraine
   or sick-headache, etc.). It is a blessing to the rest of us that we do
   not know the particular affliction that so beset Paul. Each of us has
   some such splinter or thorn in the flesh, perhaps several at once.
   Messenger of Satan [aggelos Satana]. Angel of Satan, the affliction
   personified. Buffet [kolaphizei]. See on Mt 26:67; 1Co 4:11 for this
   late and rare word from [kolaphos], fist. The messenger of Satan kept
   slapping Paul in the face and Paul now sees that it was God's will for
   it to be so.

   12:8 Concerning this thing [huper toutou]. More likely, "concerning
   this messenger of Satan." That it might depart from me [hina apostei
   aph' emou]. Second aorist active (intransitive) subjunctive of
   [aphistemi] in final clause, "that he stand off from me for good."

   12:9 He hath said [eireken]. Perfect active indicative, as if a final
   word. Paul probably still has the thorn in his flesh and needs this
   word of Christ. Is sufficient [arkei]. Old word of rich meaning,
   perhaps kin to Latin arceo, to ward off against danger. Christ's grace
   suffices and abides. Is perfected [teleitai]. Present passive
   indicative of [teleO], to finish. It is linear in idea. Power is
   continually increased as the weakness grows. See Php 4:13 for this same
   noble conception. The human weakness opens the way for more of Christ's
   power and grace. Most gladly rather [hedista mallon]. Two adverbs, one
   superlative [hedista], one comparative [mallon]. "Rather" than ask any
   more (thrice already) for the removal of the thorn or splinter "most
   gladly will I glory in my weaknesses." Slowly Paul had learned this
   supreme lesson, but it will never leave him (Ro 5:2; 2Ti 4:6-8). May
   rest upon me [episkenOsei ep' eme]. Late and rare verb in first aorist
   active subjunctive with [hina] (final clause), to fix a tent upon, here
   upon Paul himself by a bold metaphor, as if the Shechinah of the Lord
   was overshadowing him (cf. Lu 9:34), the power [dunamis] of the Lord
   Jesus.

   12:10 Wherefore I take pleasure [dio eudokO]. For this noble word see
   on Mt 3:17; 2Co 5:8. The enemies of Paul will have a hard time now in
   making Paul unhappy by persecutions even unto death (Php 1:20-26). He
   is not courting martyrdom, but he does not fear it or anything that is
   "for Christ's sake" [huper Christou]. For when [hotan gar]. "For
   whenever," indefinite time. Then I am strong [tote dunatos eimi]. At
   that very time, but not in myself, but in the fresh access of power
   from Christ for the emergency.

   12:11 I am become foolish [gegona aphrOn]. Perfect active indicative of
   [ginomai]. In spite of what he said in verse 6 that he would not be
   foolish if he gloried in the other Paul. But he feels that he has
   dropped back to the mood of 11:1,16. He has been swept on by the memory
   of the ecstasy. For I ought to have been commended by you [egO gar
   Opheilon huph' humOn sunistasthai]. Explanation of "ye compelled me."
   Imperfect active [Opheilon] of [opheilO], to be under obligation, and
   the tense here expresses an unfulfilled obligation about the present.
   But [sunistasthai] is present passive infinitive, not aorist or perfect
   passive. He literally means, "I ought now to be commended by you"
   instead of having to glorify myself. He repeats his boast already made
   (11:5f.), that he is no whit behind "the super-extra apostles" (the
   Judaizers), "though I am nothing" [ei kai ouden eimi]. Even boasting
   himself against those false apostles causes a reaction of feeling that
   he has to express (cf. 1Co 15:9; 1Ti 1:15f.).

   12:12 Of an apostle [tou apostolou]. "Of the apostle" (definite
   article). Note the three words here for miracles wrought by Paul
   [semeia], signs, [terata], wonders, [dunameis], powers or miracles) as
   in Heb 2:4.

   12:13 Wherein ye were made inferior [ho hessOthete]. First aorist
   passive indicative of [hessoomai], the text of Aleph B D instead of the
   usual [hettethete] from the common [hettaomai] to be inferior or less
   from the comparative [hettOn]. See [hessOn] in verse 15. [Ho] is the
   neuter accusative with the passive verb (Robertson, Grammar, p. 479).
   Forgive me this wrong [charisasthe moi ten adikian tauten]. Consummate
   irony to the stingy element in this church (cf. 11:9).

   12:14 Third time I am ready to come [triton touto hetoimOs echO]. Had
   he been already twice or only once? He had changed his plans once when
   he did not go (1:15f.). He will not change his plans now. This looks as
   if he had only been once (that in Ac 18). Note the third use of
   [katanarkaO] (11:9; 12:13, 14). They need not be apprehensive. He will
   be as financially independent of them as before. "I shall not sponge on
   you." Not yours, but you [ou ta humOn, alla humas]. The motto of every
   real preacher. To lay up [thesaurizein]. For this use of the verb see
   1Co 16:2 (Mt 6:19-21; Jas 5:3).

   12:15 I will most gladly spend and be spent [hedista dapanesO kai
   ekdapanethesomai]. Both future active of old verb [dapanaO] (Mr 5:26)
   to spend money, time, energy, strength and the future passive of
   [ekdapanaO], late compound to spend utterly, to spend out, [ek-], to
   spend wholly. Only here in N.T.

   12:16 I did not myself burden you [egO ou katebaresa humas]. First
   aorist active of late verb [katabareO], to press a burden down on one.
   Only here in N.T. Crafty [panourgos]. Old word from [pan], all, and
   [ergo], to do anything (good or bad). Good sense is skilful, bad sense
   cunning. Only here in N.T. and Paul is quoting the word from his
   enemies. With guile [dolOi]. Instrumental case of [dolos], bait to
   catch fish with. The enemies of Paul said that he was raising this big
   collection for himself. Moffatt has done well to put these charges in
   quotation marks to make it plain to readers that Paul is ironical.

   12:17 Did I take advantage [epleonektesa]. Paul goes right to the point
   without hedging. For this verb from [pleon] and [echO], to have more,
   see on 2Co 2:11; 7:2. By any one of them [tina--di' autou]. An
   anacoluthon for [tina] is left in the accusative without a verb and
   [di' autou] takes up the idea, "as to any one by him." Whom [hOn]. The
   genitive relative is attracted from the accusative [hous] into the case
   of the unexpressed antecedent [touton]. [Me] expects the negative
   answer as does [meti] in 18.

   12:18 The brother [ton adelphon]. Probably the brother of Titus (cf.
   8:18). Did Titus take advantage of you? [meti epleonektesen humas
   Titos?]. That puts the issue squarely. By the same Spirit [tOi autOi
   pneumati]. That translation refers to the Holy Spirit and makes the
   case instrumental. The locative case, "in the same spirit," makes it
   mean that Paul's attitude is the same as that of Titus and most likely
   is correct, for "in the same steps" [tois autois ichnesin] is in
   locative case.

   12:19 Ye think all this time [palai dokeite]. Progressive present
   indicative, "for a long time ye have been thinking." We are excusing
   ourselves [apologoumetha]. He is not just apologizing, but is in deadly
   earnest, as they will find out when he comes.

   12:20 Lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I
   would [me pOs elthOn ouch hoious thelO heurO humas]. An idiomatic
   construction after the verb of fearing [phoboumai] with [me pOs] as the
   conjunction and with [ouch] as the negative of the verb [heurO] (second
   aorist active subjunctive of [heuriskO], [me] the conjunction, [ouch]
   the negative. See Robertson, Grammar, p. 995. And I be found [kagO
   heurethO]. Same construction with first aorist passive subjunctive.
   Such as ye would not [hoion ou thelete]. Neat change in voice just
   before and position of the negative here. Lest by any means [me pOs].
   Still further negative purpose by repeating the conjunction. With
   graphic pen pictures Paul describes what had been going on against him
   during his long absence. Backbitings [katalaliai]. Late and rare word.
   In N.T. only here and 1Pe 2:1. If it only existed nowhere else!
   Whisperings [psithurismoi]. Late word from [psithurizO], to whisper
   into one's ear. An onomatopoetic word for the sibilant murmur of a
   snake charmer (Ec 10:11). Only here in N.T. Swellings [phusiOseis].
   From [phusioO], to swell up, late word only here and in ecclesiastical
   writers. Did Paul make up the word for the occasion? See on 1Co 4:6 for
   verb. Tumults [akatastasiai]. See on 2Co 6:5.

   12:21 When I come again [palin elthontos mou]. Genitive absolute. Paul
   assumes it as true. Lest my God humble me [me tapeinOsei me ho theos
   mou]. Negative final clause [me] and first aorist active subjunctive),
   going back to [phoboumai] in 20. He means a public humiliation as his
   fear. The conduct of the church had been a real humiliation whether he
   refers to a previous visit or not. That have sinned heretofore [tOn
   proemartekotOn]. Genitive plural of the articular perfect active
   participle of [proamartanO] to emphasize continuance of their sinful
   state as opposed to [me metanoesantOn] (did not repent) in the aorist
   tense.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 13

   13:1 The third time I am coming [triton erchomai]. Either the third
   that he had planned to come or that he had been twice. The warning is
   made by quoting De 19:15.

   13:2 As when I was present the second time [hOs parOn to deuteron].
   This translation assumes the second visit as already made. It is a
   natural way to take the Greek [hOs parOn]. But [hOs] with [parOn] can
   also mean "as if present" the second time (Authorized Version).
   Probably "as when" is the more natural rendering, but the other cannot
   be ruled entirely out in view of 1:15-23. If I come again [ean elthO
   eis to palin]. Condition of third class. The use of [palin] of itself
   suits the idea that Paul had not yet made the second visit as it means
   simply "again" or "back," but in Mt 26:44 we find [palin ek tritou]
   (again a third time) and so it is not decisive.

   13:3 A proof of Christ [dokimen tou Christou]. He will give it to them.
   "I will not spare." He will show that Christ speaks "in me" [en emoi].

   13:4 But we shall live with him through the power of God [alla zesomen
   sun autOi ek dunameOs theou]. So real is Paul's sense of his union with
   Christ.

   13:5 Unless indeed ye be reprobate [ei meti adokimoi este]. Paul
   challenged his opposers in Corinth to try [peirazete] themselves, to
   test [dokimazete] themselves, whether they were "in the faith" [en tei
   pistei], a much more vital matter for them than trying to prove Paul a
   heretic. Such tests can be made, unless, alas, they are "reprobate"
   [adokimoi], the very adjective that Paul held up before himself as a
   dreadful outcome to be avoided, 1Co 9:27).

   13:6 That ye shall know [hoti epignOsesthe]. Such a testing of
   themselves will give them full knowledge that Paul is not reprobate
   [adokimos]. The best way for vacillating Christians to stop it is to
   draw close to Christ.

   13:7 Though we be as reprobate [hemeis de hOs adokimoi Omen].
   Literally, "And that" [hina de]. Paul wishes them to do no wrong [kakon
   meden]. He has no desire to exercise his apostolic authority and
   "appear approved" [dokimoi phanOmen], second aorist passive subjunctive
   of [phainO]. He had far rather see them do "the noble thing" [to kalon]
   even if it should make him appear disapproved after all that he has
   said.

   13:8 Against the truth [kata tes aletheias]. He means in the long run.
   We can hinder and hold down the truth by evil deeds (Ro 1:18), but in
   the end the truth wins.

   13:9 For we rejoice [chairomen gar]. Paul had far rather be weak in the
   sense of failing to exercise his apostolic power because they did the
   noble thing. He is no Jonah who lamented when Ninevah repented. Your
   perfecting [humOn katartisin]. Late word from [katartizO], to fit, to
   equip (see verb in verse 11). In Plutarch, only here in N.T.

   13:10 That I may not when present deal sharply [hina parOn apotomOs
   chresOmai]. Late adverb from [apotomos], curt, cut off. In N.T. only
   here and Tit 1:13.

   13:12 With a holy kiss [en hagiOi philemati]. In the Jewish synagogues
   where the sexes were separated, men kissed men, the women, women. This
   apparently was the Christian custom also. It is still observed in the
   Coptic and the Russian churches. It was dropped because of charges made
   against the Christians by the pagans. In England in 1250 Archbishop
   Walter of York introduced a "pax-board" which was first kissed by the
   clergy and then passed around. Think of the germ theory of disease and
   that kissing tablet!

   13:13 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the
   communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all [he charis tou Kuriou
   Iesou Christou kai he agape tou theou kai he koinOnia tou hagiou
   pneumatos meta pantOn humOn]. This benediction is the most complete of
   them all. It presents the persons of the Trinity in full form. From 2Th
   3:17 it appears that Paul wrote the greeting or benediction with his
   own hand. We know from Ro 15:19 that Paul went round about unto
   Illyricum before, apparently, he came on to Corinth. When he did arrive
   (Ac 20:1-3) the troubles from the Judaizers had disappeared. Probably
   the leaders left after the coming of Titus and the brethren with this
   Epistle. The reading of it in the church would make a stir of no small
   proportions. But it did the work.
