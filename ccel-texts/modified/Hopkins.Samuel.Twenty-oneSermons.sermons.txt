Sermon I.

    WRITTEN IS THE YEAR 1801.

   The Reason of the Hope of a Christian, which he ought always to give to
   him who asketh it of him.

   I Peter, iii. 14, 15. And be not afraid of their terror, neither be ye
   troubled; but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always
   to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope
   that is in you, with meekness and fear.

   THE apostle Peter had a special commission to preach the gospel to the
   Jews, which did not exclude a regard to the uncircumcised Gentiles. He
   therefore writes this epistle to the Jews who were dispersed from the
   land of Israel, into various places in the Lesser Asia, and had
   embraced Christianity; with whom the Gentiles are included, who had
   become Christians, and had joined with the believing Jews. In
   consequence of their becoming Christians, they were hated, and suffered
   persecution by the unbelieving Jews and idolatrous Gentiles; who were
   disposed to inflict on them all the evils which were in their power;
   especially the former, who exercised the same ill will towards them
   which Paul had and acted out before his conversion, and which they
   manifested towards the apostles and all Christians; of which we have
   the history in the Acts of the Apostles.

   The Apostle, in this epistle to them, mentions many things to support
   and comfort them in their afflicted, suffering state, and encourage and
   animate them to persevere in the profession and practice of
   Christianity, to whatever reproaches, worldly losses and persecutions
   they might expose themselves hereby; and gives them many directions for
   their conduct in all circumstances, and towards all persons; especially
   in the present state of things. Of the latter we find an instance in
   the words now before us. The Apostle here alludes to the words of
   Isaiah in the eighth chapter of his prophecy. When the inhabitants of
   Judah were threatened with an invasion by the neighbouring nations, he
   tells them not to be afraid of them, but to sanctify the Lord of Hosts,
   and make him their fear and their dread. So the apostle tells
   Christians, when threatened with the greatest evils that the enemies to
   Christianity could inflict, not to be afraid of their terror, neither
   be troubled, but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. To sanctify the
   Lord in their hearts was to love him supremely, and trust in him alone,
   desiring that he might be exalted and glorified above all creatures
   forever. The same word in the original is translated hallowed, which is
   here rendered sanctify. "Hallowed be thy name:" that is, may thy sacred
   name and glorious character be made known, displayed and glorified to
   the highest degree, by all things that take place.

   "And be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you the
   reason of the hope that is in you." Christians are directed to be
   always able, ready and willing to give the reason of their hope, to
   every one who asketh it of them. This must be understood with some
   limitation. By every one who asketh, is meant every one who asketh in a
   proper, decent manner, and with an apparent, professed desire to know
   what reasons Christians can give for their hope. If any asked them to
   do this, with an apparent design to ridicule and mock them, and to get
   some advantage, and matter of accusation against them, which would
   expose them to suffering; they were not obliged to answer such, as it
   would be contrary to the command of Christ: "Give not that which is
   holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they
   trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent you."

   "With meekness and fear." Christians are not to be haughty and insolent
   in giving the reason of their hope, nor cuter into ostentatious and
   angry disputes with unbelievers. They must not despise and treat them
   with contempt for their unreasonable disbelief; but pity them, and
   treat them with condescension, tenderness and benevolence, not shewing
   or having any angry resentment for any injurious treatment they may
   have received from them; but suffering and bearing all injuries with a
   meek and quiet spirit and behaviour. All this is implied in meekness.
   Fear is here put for Christian humility, in opposition to
   high-mindedness, and self-confidence, boasting of their privileges and
   character, by which they are favoured and distinguished from those who
   are in a state of darkness and unbelief. It implies a sense of their
   own exceeding unworthiness, and utter insufficiency in themselves to
   defend and maintain the honour of the Christian cause, without constant
   support and assistance from divine grace; and continual liableness to
   fail of their duty, and dishonour Christ, by not speaking and behaving
   as becomes their Christian calling and profession. This fear is
   essential to the Christian character, and becomes Christians at all
   times. The apostle Paul exhorts Christians "not to be high minded, but
   fear; to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling," and
   tells the Christians at Corinth, that he was among them in fear and
   much trembling.

   The subject proposed to be considered, in a further improvement of the
   words before us, is, the hope of Christians, and the reason they have
   to give, and ought always to be ready to give, for this their hope,
   when properly required of them.

   I. It is to be considered what is included in the hope of Christians.

   This hope indeed implies and comprehends more than words can express,
   or the most enlarged mind on earth can conceive. The greatest
   Christians do in this state comprehend and know but a small part of
   what is contained in this hope. And they depend on the enlightening
   influences of the Spirit of Christ, for the increasing knowledge of
   this which they may and ought to obtain in this life. Therefore the
   apostle Paul prays for the Christians at Ephesus, "that God would give
   unto them the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;
   the eyes of their understanding being enlightened, that they might know
   what was the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of
   his inheritance in the saints." Christians may be assisted in their
   meditations on this pleasing and important subject, by attending to the
   following brief and scanty representation of their hope, taken from the
   holy scriptures.

   Jesus Christ is the Christian's hope. What is contained in his person
   and character; in what he has done and suffered; in the manifestations
   he has made of the divine perfections; in his revealed designs and
   promises to his church, and to every believer, is all the Christian can
   hope for, or can desire, and far, infinitely far, exceeds his highest
   expectations, and the utmost stretch of his conception and imagination.
   Jesus Christ has an infinite fulness for sinners. He has all they want,
   and they cannot conceive or wish for any greater or other good. And he
   gives himself, and all he has, his infinite fulness, to every believer.

   Christians hope by Christ to obtain the free pardon of all their sins,
   however many and great they are, and to be delivered from the curse of
   the law of God, even eternal destruction and misery, and from all evil.
   As the children of God, they hope for his kind protection to defend
   them from all real evil while in this world; that what is in itself
   evil shall be made to them a real good, so that all things shall
   conspire to promote their greatest good. They hope, in the best way and
   manner, and the most proper time, to be delivered from all sin and
   moral depravity, and made perfectly holy, by Christ their Saviour; and
   that their salvation shall be for the glory of God and the Redeemer
   forever; otherwise it would be no salvation to them. They trust in the
   wisdom and goodness of Christ to order the time and manner of their
   death so as shall be most for his glory and their good. They hope that
   when they drop their bodies into the grave they shall immediately enter
   Into a world of light and complete happiness, being wholly transformed
   into the moral likeness of Christ; and in the enjoyment of him, and of
   his favour and love, and beholding his glory; and in the happy society
   of the redeemed, shall enjoy uninterrupted, increasing felicity without
   end.

   The Christian's hope includes in it an assured and pleasing prospect
   that Christ will destroy the works and kingdom of the devil on earth,
   and set up his own kingdom, and give his people the possession of the
   world, tor at least a thousand years; which happy time for the meek,
   the saints, to possess the earth, and delight in the abundance of peace
   and happiness, shall commence and continue in a time and manner most
   agreeable to Infinite Wisdom and Goodness. And the Christian expects
   the set time will come, and is hastening on, when Christ will come to
   judgment, raise the dead, and assemble all the children of Adam before
   him, when he will sentence the impenitent wicked to everlasting
   punishment, and invite and bring his friends into the possession of his
   eternal kingdom, to enjoy perfect and progressing happiness forever;
   and that they shall see, and have a most pleasing and eternally
   increasing conviction, when all the enemies of Christ are put under his
   feet, and all things are adjusted and brought to their proper and
   designed issue, that all events which have taken place, even all the
   evil, sin and misery which has been, and will exist for ever, are
   included in the divine purpose and plan, which was in the highest
   wisdom and goodness fixed and ordained from eternity, and are
   necessary, in the most proper and desirable manner, and to the highest
   possible degree, to promote the glory of God in the most clear
   manifestation and brightest display of the divine perfections, and
   produce the highest happiness and glory of the eternal kingdom of God.
   This will be contemplated forever, and will be a source of growing
   entertainment, and part of the happiness which is included in the
   Christian's hope. The work of redemption by Christ is so grand,
   wonderful and complicated, the effect of infinite power, wisdom and
   goodness, exercised in the most astonishing condescention, grace and
   mercy, truth and faithfulness, to infinitely guilty, lost and miserable
   sinners, in a way honourable to a holy, righteous God, his law and
   government, and suited to humble and save sinful rebels, and raise them
   to the highest honour and happiness; and is attended with such
   infinitely great, important, glorious, eternal consequences; that the
   redeemed must enjoy unspeakably great and increasing happiness in
   searching into the wonders of this work, and loving, praising and
   adoring God and the Redeemer forever.

   Every true Christian hopes to enjoy all this, and more, which no tongue
   can utter, or heart conceive; and he shall actually possess it forever.
   He will stand at the right hand of Christ at the day of judgment, and
   enter with all the redeemed into eternal life and happiness, and enjoy
   the company and friendship of a most lovely and happy society, all
   sweetly united in love to Christ and to each other, under the best
   advantages to enjoy God, in the assurance of his favour and love, and
   to be happy in friendship with each other, and make rapid advances in
   knowledge, holiness and happiness forever.--But the theme is endless,
   and it is time to stop.--This is the hope of a Christian!

   II. The reason which Christians have to give for this hope which is in
   them, or entertained by them, is to be considered.

   This involves two particulars, which are in themselves really distinct,
   though implied in each other; and therefore it is proper to consider
   them separately. They are these: The reason they have to believe and be
   sure that the Christian scriptures, the foundation of all their hopes,
   are a revelation from God, containing infallible truth, without any
   error, in matters of faith and practice, and therefore to be relied
   upon with the greatest confidence and safety; and the reason of their
   hope that they are real Christians, and interested in all the blessings
   promised in the gospel to true believers in Christ.

   First, The Christian, in giving the reason of his hope, must tell what
   evidence he has that Christianity is a divine institution, and that the
   scriptures which contain a revelation of it were written by the
   inspiration of God.

   Here Christians are introduced to speak for themselves, and give the
   reason of placing their hope in Christ and the gospel. They have the
   following answer to give to those who ask them.

   1. We feel the want of a hope of some good and happiness which cannot
   be obtained and enjoyed in this life, and in this world. We find
   ourselves possessed of those mental capacities and desires which cannot
   be filled and satisfied with the enjoyment of any or all the things of
   this world, the objects of time and sense. We know we have a capacity
   of enjoying a higher and better good than this world affords, and a
   good which is unfading, and will last to be enjoyed without any end;
   and we feel strong desires, which we cannot suppress, of existing
   forever, in the enjoyment of objects which will render us completely
   happy. This has excited us diligently to search and inquire whether and
   where any ground and good reason can be found for a hope of enjoying
   the good and happiness which is answerable to our capacity and desires.

   2. If the Bible be excluded, upon the most diligent and extensive
   search we have been able to make, no sufficient reason has been found,
   or can be given, for a hope of a good adequate to the capacity and
   desires of man. The heathen who have not enjoyed the Bible, even the
   wisest among them, have not discovered any certainty of a future state.
   And all their conjectures about it, and ideas of happiness to be
   enjoyed after death if there be a future state, are so vague, uncertain
   and absurd, that they can give no satisfaction to a rational mind, but
   tend to the contrary. They have obtained no true notions of the
   character of the true God; so far from it, that they represent their
   gods in a ridiculous and shameful light, and as practising horrible
   vices. None of them, even their greatest philosophers, have been able
   to find out what true happiness is. They are indeed, and always have
   been, without the true God, and without a reasonable hope in the world.

   And this is true of the Mahometans. They profess indeed to believe in
   one God, which Mahomet taught them with a number of other things, who
   learned them from the Bible, with which he was in some measure
   acquainted; but they have no correct, consistent notions of the divine
   character, especially of his moral character. They do not know of any
   reasonable way for sinners to obtain pardon of their sins, and the
   favour of God; and consequently cannot have any reasonable hope of
   this. The most ignorant and vicious men among them have a promise of
   their prophet that they shall go directly to heaven, if they die
   fighting for his cause and their religion, or if they perform certain
   prescribed actions and ceremonies. And the heaven they hope for they
   think consists, not in holiness and in the enjoyment of the true God,
   and the mental happiness implied in this, but in those sensual delights
   and gratifications, more suited for beads than men; which are the
   objects of aversion and abhorrence, and not of hope, to a good and pure
   mind.

   The Infidels, Deists and Atheists who live in that part of the world
   called Christian are really without hope. The latter are professedly
   so: they have no belief of a future state, and have no hope of any good
   which they cannot enjoy in this life, which to every discerning mind is
   nothing but vanity and vexation of spirit. These choose to view and
   place themselves in such a low state of existence that they have no
   pre-eminence above the beasts, except that they are capable of
   suffering more pain and misery than the brute creation.

   As to the Deists, they profess to believe there is a God; but do not
   appear to worship him, or derive any enjoyment from their belief. Many
   of them, with Atheists, do not believe there is any future state; but
   say they expect to die as the beasts, and have no further existence.
   Others of them consider it as a matter of uncertainty whether they
   shall exist in a future state or not; and they who profess to believe
   they shall exist after death, can give no satisfactory account of the
   happiness they shall enjoy, nor any reason of their hope of happiness
   in the forgiveness of their sins and the favour of God, whom they have
   offended. For reason, on which they depend, affords no evidence that
   God will forgive them; but rather that they must fall under his
   displeasure, and be miserable forever. They can have no hope from the
   god they profess to believe exists. Having renounced the God revealed
   in the Bible, they are wholly at a loss about the character of their
   god. Some of them ascribe no moral character to him; and they who do,
   cannot agree in what it is; and none of them can tell whether, or how
   far, men have any concern in it, so as to have any influence on their
   conduct or happiness. So that they are all without any reasonable hope,
   having renounced the true God.

   Therefore, if the Christian hope be not founded upon reason and truth,
   but must be given up as fabulous and mere delusion, we are left without
   hope, and we must sink into the most gloomy darkness and despair. But,

   3. We find in the Bible an exhibition of that good which is suited to
   make us completely and forever happy, containing all that we can desire
   or hope for. It reveals a most agreeable and wise way for the pardon of
   sinners, and their reconciliation with God, and to enjoy his favour as
   much, and to an higher degree, and be much more happy, than if they had
   never sinned. It contains repeated and abundant promises of deliverance
   from all evil, and the everlasting enjoyment of the best and highest
   good of which we are or ever shall be capable. All this is offered and
   bestowed as a free gift on every one who is willing to receive it, and
   asketh for it. We will not enter into more particulars here in
   description of this hope. They have been represented in the former part
   of this discourse, and will of course come into view under the next
   head. We will only observe here, that the infinite good comprehended in
   the redemption of sinners, which is the subject of the revelation in
   the Bible, is the only proper and complete object of hope that can be
   conceived of or imagined by a reasonable and good mind, if it be true,
   and there is evidence that it is indeed a revelation which is given to
   men from God, Which leads us to say,

   4. There is clear, most satisfactory and abundant evidence, fully
   answerable to the nature and importance of the subject, that the Bible
   is true, and contains a revelation from God.

   But before we enter upon the short and summary detail of this evidence
   which we propose to give, the following things will be mentioned.

   Though the evidence of the truth of divine revelation is sufficient to
   convince the understanding and judgment of those who will seriously
   attend to the subject, though they have had hearts, and do not really
   love the truths it contains; yet they cannot have that satisfactory
   assurance that it is from God, and indeed a divine revelation, which
   those of upright and good hearts have, though their understandings and
   mental powers be not so bright and strong; as those of others whose
   hearts are not good.

   It may also be observed, that truths and objects of a moral and
   spiritual nature may be the objects of as great certainty, yea greater,
   than those objects and things whose existence is known only by our
   bodily senses; so that a man of an honest and good heart, and right
   taste and discerning, would doubt of the truth of the latter, rather
   than of the former, if one must be doubted of and given up as not true.

   We would further observe here, that if it were possible that the
   Christian hope is a mere delusion, which we know is not true, and is
   impossible; yet we should lose nothing by entertaining it. We shall in
   the issue be as well off as those who have no hope, if we should cease
   to exist at death, or in whatever state we should be, we should not be
   in a worse state than others, or than we should be had we not been
   Christians. We have a high enjoyment in our hope now, which will
   continue as long as we are in this world. It is constantly better to us
   than all worldly enjoyments, and we should be great losers by
   exchanging it with the most happy worldly man, for all his enjoyments.
   Our hope is a constant source of high enjoyment, which unspeakably more
   than counterbalances all the uneasiness and sufferings which are
   occasioned by it, be they ever so many and great. Therefore
   unbelievers, if they knew we were deluded, which they do not know, and
   never will, would act an unreasonable, injurious and cruel part, to
   take our hope from us, if they could, or even to attempt it; for if
   this could be effected, it would deprive us of more happiness than they
   ever did or can enjoy, which is better to us than all this world. And
   we should sink down into the most gloomy state of despair and misery,
   which they who never had the Christian hope cannot feel or suffer while
   in this world. [1]

   We now return to the point proposed, to speak of the reason we have of
   our hope, grounded on the evidence that the gospel is from heaven,
   which amounts to as great demonstrative certainty as there is or can be
   of any proposition which was ever proposed or thought of. We have read
   the Bible over and over again, and with much more care and attention
   than we bestowed on any other book. And the more we have read it, and
   attended to and understood the truths contained in it, the more clear
   and certain has the evidence appeared of its divine original, and the
   greater pleasure we have had in the things which it reveals.

   When we enter on this theme, it is not easy to determine where to
   begin, or where to end. There is so great a multiplicity of evidence
   that the scriptures contain a revelation from God, and the number of
   particulars from which this is proved is so great, that it would take
   more time than we now have, to mention all of them. We can only give a
   summary view of this evidence now, which we are sure is a sufficient
   reason of our hope, of which we shall never be ashamed.

   It is common and proper to distinguish the evidence that the Bible has
   a divine original, into that which is called external, and that which
   is internal, consisting in the doctrines, truths and duties which are
   revealed and inculcated therein. We shall endeavour to consider these
   separately, though they will naturally, and perhaps to the best
   advantage, be, in some instances, in a degree blended together.
   Certainly the honest mind will view them together, and at once, as
   strengthening each other, and amounting to a clear demonstration of
   this truth.

   The external evidence consists in the manner in which the Christian
   scriptures have been made, and given to the world; the men and their
   character who wrote them, and the manner of their writing; the miracles
   which have been wrought in confirmation of the truth of the facts
   related, and the doctrines and commands made known, and that they who
   spoke and wrote were inspired by God to speak and do what they did; the
   numerous predictions of things and events which should come to pass,
   many of which were accomplished soon, others have come to pass long
   since they were predicted, and many are fulfilling now before our eyes,
   in the revolutions which are taking place, and the present state of the
   nations and of the world; the spread of Christianity among the nations,
   by the men who were the principal instruments of propagating it, and
   the preservation and continuance of it in the world to this day,
   notwithstanding the great and constant opposition to it which has been
   made.

   These are the chief, but not all, the external evidences of the divine
   original of the Bible; which must be more particularly considered. The
   men by whom it was written appear to be men of good natural abilities,
   sensible, honest and serious, as men really inspired by God to write
   would be. They were not a number of men who lived at the same time, and
   could consult together, and lay a scheme what to write; but lived in
   different ages, the last above a thousand years after the first who
   wrote. They do not appear selfish, proud and vain, to seek their own
   worldly honour or interest, but the contrary. The manner of their
   writing is inimitable, and differs from the writings of all other men*
   This has been observed and illustrated by many authors, and is needless
   for us to repeat. They write an orderly history of the world from the
   beginning of it to the time of those last events which relate to the
   subjects on which they wrote. And this history is carried on by them to
   the end of the world by their predictions. This is the most ancient,
   well authenticated, consistent, important and useful history, that was
   ever formed by uninspired men, or ever will or can be. It exhibits one
   grand scheme and plan of events, all uniting and conspiring to bring
   all things to the most happy issue, worthy of the infinite Being who is
   infinitely powerful, wise and good. It is as really impossible that any
   uninspired man or number of men, especially who lived in such distant
   ages of the world, should make the writings which we find in the Bible,
   as it is for them to contrive and make the visible world: and we have
   as satisfying evidence that the scriptures contained in the Bible were
   written by the inspiration of God, as we have that the sun, moon and
   liars, and all the visible world, were made by him; especially if we
   take into view the facts which we are now going to mention.

   Moses, who was the first writer, gave abundant proof that what he
   wrote, said and did, was by the inspiration, command and direction of
   the true God, by the numerous miracles which he wrought, and the
   predictions he made, which were fulfilled directly, or in the time of
   his life, and have been since fulfilled. And here we would observe,
   that prophecy, when it is fulfilled, is a real miracle, as absolute,
   independent prescience is an incommunicable attribute of God; and when
   a man has ability to know and foretel events that are future, this is
   as much above what are called the laws of nature, as the ability to
   work any miracle whatever, and is an evidence of divine inspiration.
   Therefore miracles, and prophecy which comes to pass, may be considered
   together, as they are frequently united in the same event in the
   scriptures. Thus most of the miracles wrought by Moses in Egypt, at the
   Red Sea, and in the wilderness, during forty years, were accompanied by
   predictions of the miraculous event before it took place, though the
   latter was instantaneous with the former, and both were of the nature
   of a miracle. And so were all the prophecies of Moses which have since
   been fulfilled, by which, and by all the miracles done by him, his
   divine mission was fully confirmed, in the view of the whole nation of
   Israel; and this has been handed down through all ages since in the
   church, and been increasing by the fulfilment of many of his
   prophecies, and the discovery of the import and design of the
   institutions which he appointed, which he declared he received from
   heaven. And, indeed, all or most of the ordinances instituted by Moses
   contained predictions, pointing out the character of the Saviour who
   was to come into the world, and what was to be done and suffered by him
   for the redemption of man, which were exactly fulfilled in him,
   together with all the predictions of him by the prophets who arose
   after Moses. All the mosaic institutions, and all the miracles he did,
   and predictions he uttered, all the miracles and prophecies by the
   prophets after Moses, with all the events which took place, were
   designed and suited to prepare the way for that event, the incarnation
   of the Son of God; so that divine design and wisdom is to be seen, by
   those who will properly attend, superintending through the whole. It is
   impossible it should be a mere human contrivance. At the very time
   which was pointed out and fixed by the prophets hundreds of years
   before, when there was consequently a general expectation of the
   appearance of the promised Saviour, and the Hate of the Jews and of the
   world was made ready for such an event, the expected Messiah came, in a
   character and in just such circumstances as were described and foretold
   long before by the prophets. He wrought many miracles, by which he
   proved that he was the Son of God, the very person predicted by the
   prophets, and taught the most important truth, in a manner which was
   never done by any mere man. He was a perfect example of humility,
   meekness, uprightness, benevolence, wisdom and piety, and taught, both
   by precept and example, the nature and properties of true religion, and
   the only excellent and perfect morality.--But now we have insensibly
   run into what properly belongs to the next head, of internal evidence.

   He instructed his disciples into the meaning of those prophecies which
   related to him; and from this, and acquaintance with him, his doctrines
   and precepts, and the miracles he wrought, they believed with all their
   heart that he was the Son of God, who was to come into the world. The
   body of the nation of Jews, especially their teachers and leaders, the
   scribes and pharisees, were so sunk into depravity and ignorance, their
   hearts were so very bad and vicious, that they did not understand the
   prophecies concerning him; nor could they approve of his person,
   character and doctrines, all which condemned them; but they hated them
   with a hatred which could not be satisfied till they had put him to a
   cruel and ignominious death, which he had repeatedly foretold, and the
   consequent destruction of that nation, to his disciples, and the
   ancient prophets had predicted. He also said that he should rise from
   death on the third day. But his enemies had no expectation or belief of
   this, but were disposed to reject all the evidence that could be given
   of such a fact. And even his disciples and friends did not understand
   the prophets nor the words of Christ on this point, and knew not what
   to think of his being put to death as he was, and were wholly in the
   dark as to the consequence, till the evidence that he was risen from
   the dead was irresistibly forced upon them.

   When he had given incontestible evidence of his resurrection to a
   sufficient number of chosen, competent witnesses, who could not be
   deceived, and conversed with them a considerable time, and given them
   proper instructions, they declared that they saw him ascend towards
   heaven in a cloud till out of their light; and that two angels appeared
   to them, who told them he was gone to heaven, and would return again at
   the day of judgment. They retired, and waited till, as he had promised
   them, they received from heaven miraculous power to bear witness of his
   resurrection, and proclaim salvation to sinners upon believing in his
   name. They were soon endued with power, and enabled to work miracles to
   prove the truth of their testimony that Christ was risen from the dead,
   and gone to heaven, and had commanded them to preach the gospel to the
   world, and that in this they said nothing but what was contained in the
   writings of Moses and the prophets. They went forth, and, contrary to
   all human probability and expectation of the success of such a small
   number of poor, low, illiterate men, with such a message, so contrary
   to the strong prejudices and prevailing customs both of Jews and
   Gentiles, and to the lusts and evil propensities which naturally reign
   in the hearts of all men, they made numerous converts to Christianity,
   from among the Jews and the idolatrous heathen.

   It is impossible that these facts should take place, unless
   Christianity were from heaven, and the apostles were assured that what
   they related concerning Christ was true. That, in their then
   circumstances, they should undertake to propagate Christianity, without
   any worldly motives, and in the prospect of poverty, disgrace and
   suffering, which they knew was as contrary to the natural inclinations
   of men as any thing can be, cannot be accounted for, unless on the
   supposition they knew that what they declared was true, and most
   important to themselves and others, and that they could depend upon the
   promise of Christ to support and succeed them. And it appears to us
   that their success in propagating Christianity, and being supported in
   the midst of opposition. and suffering, till they had collected a
   number of churches, is a demonstration that divine power upheld them,
   and changed the hearts of men so as to dispose them to attend to and
   receive the gospel. This was as far above all mere human contrivance
   and efforts as is the production of the natural world, and cannot be
   accounted for without supposing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,
   and that the apostles were enabled to do those great and wonderful
   things by his assisting power, agreeable to the relation given of this
   matter in the Bible.

   And that the gospel has spread among the nations, and Christianity has
   been continued to this day, notwithstanding the constant and strong
   opposition which has been made to it in so many ways, is, as we may
   say, a constant miracle, and a clear evidence that it has a divine
   original; and is a demonstration that it is of God, according to the
   test proposed by the good sense of the learned Gamaliel. If this
   counsel, or this work, had been of men, it would have come to nought
   long ago: but since it has continued to this day, and men, with all
   their cunning and power, with which they have in all ages attempted it,
   have not been able to overthrow it, its divine original is
   demonstrated, and it must be of God. And we are certain that all they
   who do oppose Christianity, and attempt to overthrow it, are fighting
   against God, and will be disappointed and confounded.

   We will finish this head by mentioning the state in which the Jews now
   are, and have been since the destruction of Jerusalem and their temple;
   and the present state of the world -, which are agreeable to the
   predictions in the Bible. The state into which the Jews have fallen in
   consequence of the crucifixion of Christ by that nation, who wished
   that the guilt of his blood might fall on them and their posterity, is
   agreeable to the prophecies of Moses and the other prophets; to the
   predictions of Christ and the apostles; and are, in this view, a
   standing evidence of the truth of Christianity: which might be
   illustrated by a number of particulars, had we time to mention them.
   Their continuing a distinct people in their dispersion among the
   nations of the earth for so many ages, which is a sort of public,
   continual miracle, holds them in a situation in which they are prepared
   for the visible accomplishment of those many predictions and promises,
   which we find in the Bible, of mercy in store for them, by their being
   made willing to submit to Christ, and come into his fold, the Christian
   church, with the Gentiles: which is a confirming evidence of the truth
   of the gospel, and that this happy event will take place. And that the
   time is not far distant appears from other prophecies, and the present
   state of the world.

   This leads us to observe, that the state of the Christian church from
   the days of the apostles to this time, and to the end of the world, and
   the state, changes and revolutions of the nations of the world,
   especially so far as they have any relation to the church, are foretold
   in the prophetic part of scripture, particularly by the prophet Daniel,
   and in the revelation given to the apostle John; which have been
   exactly fulfilled so far as they relate to the past and present time.
   And we may hence rely upon the accomplishment of the predictions of the
   events which are yet to take place. The great apostacy which has taken
   place in the church of Christ, by Antichrist or the Pope, by which the
   church of Rome is become a corrupt, false church, was particularly
   foretold, with many particular circumstances relating to its character,
   and treatment of true Christians, &c. the rise of it, and the time of
   its continuance, and final overthrow. Many things predicted of this
   false church have already come to pass, which are publicly known, and
   needless for us now to mention. It is evident that this false church,
   which in scripture is called a harlot, with those who support her, and
   all her appendages, are on the decline, and hastening to the
   destruction predicted. Five vials of the wrath of God, predicted in the
   sixteenth chapter of the prophecy by John, have already been poured out
   on her, and the sixth vial is now running, under which Antichrist is to
   sink, and the way be prepared for his final overthrow; which is now
   taking place in sight of the world. While this is doing, according to
   the prophecy, the spirits of devils are to be let loose in the
   Christian world, as they never were before, and under their influence
   all orders of men are to become exceeding corrupt and wicked, more
   generally, and to a greater degree, than ever before, and own
   themselves in opposition to God and the Redeemer. And do we not see
   this representation fall fulfilling from year to year? Is it not known
   that infidelity, Deism, Atheism, and all kinds of gross error, and of
   vice and wickedness, which are the genuine fruits of these, are rapidly
   spreading, and prevail every where? Surely all must be sensible of this
   who can discern the signs of the times. Let who will shut their eyes,
   and live in ignorance, it appears to us a striking evidence that the
   events of this time are a fulfilment of the above mentioned prophecy;
   and that, after the accomplishment of the events predicted under the
   seventh vial, the millennium, or prosperous and happy state of the
   church on earth, so much the subject of prophecy, both in the Old
   Testament and the New, will commence.

   Having, as briefly as we could, stated the leading things in which the
   external evidence that the Bible contains a revelation from heaven
   consists, we proceed to mention what we call the internal evidence of
   the same truth. This, we think, is more than answerable to the fair and
   promising outside, if we may so call it, which we have been
   considering, and is suited to establish every honest and good heart in
   assurance that the gospel is of God.

   The Bible reveals the being, perfections, works and designs of God, and
   sets them in a more grand, important, rational and desirable light,
   than ever has or could be discovered by uninspired men, or has been
   conceived by any man who is not acquainted with the Bible. God is here
   represented as without beginning to exist, omnipotent, omniscient,
   omnipresent, infinitely and unchangeably wise and good, just, true and
   faithful; as the Creator of all things, and constantly upholding,
   directing and governing them in all their revolutions and motions; all
   which are included in a most wise plan of operation, which has been
   fixed by him from eternity, is endless, absolutely perfect, and
   immutable; that he exercises a most perfect and wise moral government
   over all his rational creatures, to whom he gives a natural capacity of
   moral action, and obedience to all his laws, which are perfect, just
   and good. The law of God respects and requires a perfectly right
   disposition and exercises toward him and all fellow creatures; to love
   him with all the heart, and our neighbour as ourselves. It assures
   favour and happiness to the perfectly obedient, and curses the
   disobedient, with a curse which implies endless destruction. In short,
   the Bible reveals such a God as must be most pleasing and desirable to
   every perfectly innocent and good mind. Such have all they can desire
   or wish for in such a God, such a law and moral government; therefore
   to them he is the only true God, and their chosen portion and
   happiness; while they know that all the notions that have been
   entertained of the Divine Character and his law by those who have not
   taken them from the Bible, and are not consistent with it, are
   erroneous, foolish and wicked.

   The Bible gives a particular and rational account of the creation of
   this visible world, which is no where else to be found; and of the
   creation of man, by making one man and one woman, from whom all mankind
   descended. It relates the sin and apostacy of these first: created
   parents of the human race, and how, by this, total moral depravity and
   sinfulness came upon all their children, by which they are all, in
   their natural state, under the curse of the law of God. That all men
   are by nature depraved and sinful, is a fact evident to all who attend
   to the matter; but how and in what way they are become so, none have
   been able to give any good reason, who have not been acquainted with
   the Bible, or have rejected the account that gives of it, which appears
   rational, consistent and satisfactory to those who have an upright and
   good heart, and even to the sober reason of all who examine it without
   a great degree of prejudice and pride.

   But the Bible reveals that which is infinitely more important to us,
   and to mankind, which never could have been known or thought of by any
   creature, had not God revealed it. This is the great design and work of
   the redemption of man by Jesus Christ, the Son of God; which is the
   great subject: of revelation, as the whole has reference to this, and
   would be needless in any other view. This fixes a divine stamp on the
   whole, as it makes a more clear, full and wonderful manifestation and
   display of the divine perfections, power, wisdom, holiness, goodness,
   justice, truth, grace and mercy, than otherwise could have been done;
   which cannot be known by those who never heard of this revelation, or
   who reject it as not coming from God.

   In the gospel all mankind are represented as sinners, transgressors of
   the law of God, and under the curse of it. And a way is opened by which
   sinners may be delivered from this curie, and be recovered to holiness,
   the favour of God, and eternal life, consistent with maintaining and
   honouring the law of God, and displaying his justice and truth, his
   hatred of sin, and disposition to punish it. This has been effected by
   the incarnation of the Son of God, who is really God manifest in the
   flesh; who by his suffering unto death in the flesh, and paying perfect
   obedience to the law, for man, and in his stead, has so honoured the
   law, both the precepts and penalty of it, that God may be just,
   according to the true spirit and design of it, and pardon and justify
   sinners who approve of the character and works of the Mediator, and
   trust in him. This is the sum of the matter, which might be enlarged
   upon, and illustrated without end. But we shall only say now, that to
   us the wisdom and all the perfections of God are displayed in the
   gospel; that this is the true God and eternal life, and that with good
   reason, and with the most perfect safety, we may place our highest
   hopes on this sure foundation.

   The disciples of Jesus appear to give a fair and honest history of what
   he said and did, and of the treatment he received. They neither give
   him or themselves any praise, encomiums or flattering titles. They only
   relate facts respecting him, themselves and his friends and enemies,
   without making any reflections in his or their own favour, or against
   his enemies. They relate their own faults, without offering any
   palliation or excuse. No uninspired writer ever did, or could, or ever
   will, write a history of any particular person, or of so many important
   and extraordinary events, in which he is as much interested, as those
   who wrote the historical part of the New Testament were in the facts
   which they relate, in the manner in which they have written. Christ
   uniformly spake and acted with a dignity, condescension, seriousness,
   wisdom and prudence which became a person of the character which he
   sustained, and the work he came into the world to perform. He never
   erred or made the lead mistake in all he said and did.

   Christ taught the most sublime, important and pure doctrines,
   respecting God and the state of man, the way of his recovery to the
   favour of God, to holiness and true happiness, and in what these
   consist. He taught that God was sovereign and independent in bestowing
   his mercy on men; that he had mercy on whom he pleased, for which men
   depend wholly on him; that all men were so wholly depraved and wicked
   at heart, that they refused to come to the light when set before them;
   that they hated the light; yea, that they hated him and God his Father,
   and continued to do so, till they were born again of the Spirit of God,
   by which a new, obedient heart was given; that previous to this they
   did not understand or see the things of the Spirit and kingdom of God;
   therefore all who come to the knowledge of the truth, and embrace the
   gospel, are taught of God; in which he has mercy on whom he will have
   mercy, making the distinction according to the dictates of hi$ wisdom
   and goodness, what will be best to promote the highest good of the
   universe, which cannot be done by the salvation of all. This is clearly
   and concisely expressed by Christ: "All that the Father giveth me shall
   come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out." This
   recommends the gospel to us as true and from heaven, as consistent and
   most excellent; as no man or set of men, uninspired, would have
   represented mankind in so bad a light, and so dependent on God for a
   new and better heart; or that every thing and circumstance relating to
   the salvation of men is under the direction of Infinite Wisdom and
   Goodness; all which is clearly taught in the Bible.

   This leads us to say, that the gospel appears tons evidently of divine
   original, and we are sure that it is not of man, because it represents
   man as so infinitely guilty, odious and ill-deserving, that he cannot
   recommend himself to the least favour by any thing he can do or suffer;
   and that it is unbecoming the holy and just God to pardon and save him
   out of respect to any thing good and deserving in him, but purely on
   the account of the atonement, righteousness and infinite worthiness of
   a Mediator, to whom the unworthy sinner is united by faith: so that the
   salvation of men, from the foundation to the top-stone, from beginning
   to the end, is of mere sovereign. wonderful mercy and grace, by which
   man is thoroughly abased and humbled, and his salvation must be
   ascribed, not in the least to himself, but wholly to the undeserved,
   sovereign grace of God. This is perfectly agreeable to the law of God,
   and the sinful, guilty state of man; and there is no other possible way
   in which he could be saved, consistent with the divine law, and the
   guilty state of man. It is impossible that this should be the
   contrivance of man, as it is directly contrary to his thoughts and
   reigning disposition, and is the principal reason of the opposition men
   make to the gospel, and why none will cordially embrace it till they
   have a new heart, a heart to confess their sins, and humble themselves
   in the sight of God, and receive offered mercy as a free, undeserved
   gift to the infinitely guilty and wretched, and with pleasure ascribe
   all the honour and glory of their salvation to God alone; by which they
   are prepared to enjoy true happiness, of which they were before wholly
   ignorant and destitute.

   We have another all-convincing evidence that the gospel is true, and
   has a divine original, from the duties and the nature of the religion
   taught and enjoined by Christ and his apostles, which are different
   from any thing of this kind recommended by men not inspired, and in
   many respects contrary thereto. The Bible teaches that all true
   religion has its beginning in the heart of man, in the fear of God, and
   consists in supreme love to him, and unreserved devotedness to his
   honour and interest in all our exercises and conduct, which implies
   constant devotion in prayer and praise, and a religious acknowledgment
   of him at all times, and in the proper seasons of public and social
   worship, as well as that which is more private and secret. Christ said,
   men must deny themselves, and forsake all they had, for his sake, in
   order to be his true disciples; that they must be humble, meek, upright
   and benevolent, even towards their worst enemies; do them all the good
   in their power, and pray for them: forgive those who injured them, and
   indulge no disposition to retaliate and avenge themselves; but be
   harmless, and injure no man. In sum, the religion and morality taught
   in the Bible, especially by Christ and his apostles, is as much
   superior, in its reasonableness and excellence, to any thing of the
   kind which has been taught by men who have not derived their sentiments
   from revelation, as light is to darkness, and is perfectly suited to
   make those who heartily embrace it and conform to it happy in this
   world and forever. And we must further observe, that the religion and
   morality inculcated in the Bible is urged by the strongest motives, not
   only as most reasonable, and tending to render society happy in this
   world; but as it is enjoined by divine authority, with the promise of
   eternal happiness to all who obey, and an awful threatening of endless
   punishment to all others; in which opposite states all shall be fixed
   at the great day of general judgment.

   We have now, in a summary way, given the reasons of our belief and
   assurance that the Bible contains a divine revelation, and of our hope
   in Christ. We see enough in him to satisfy us, even all we can wish, or
   hope for, or desire; enough to make us happy, beyond our present
   conception, in his eternal kingdom; and not us only, but all that shall
   believe on him, which we would earnestly urge on all those to whom we
   have access; knowing that all who believe shall be saved, and all who
   do not believe on him shall be damned.

   We are sensible that Christianity has been greatly opposed in all ages
   since its institution, and much has been written, and many objections
   have been made, against it, by men of great parts and learning, which
   have been fully and abundantly refuted by Christian writers, some of
   whole writings we have seen. We know also that infidelity has greatly
   increased of late, and is now increasing; and that many, who profess to
   believe Christianity to be true, are rejecting the most essential
   doctrines of it, and there are many others who do not cordially embrace
   it, or live answerable to the precepts of it. But this is so far from
   making us hesitate, or abating our belief and confidence of the truth
   of it, that we consider it as a confirmation that it is from God. For
   if mankind be so corrupt and wicked as to be enemies to the true God,
   which the Bible asserts, and is proved by their general conduct, then
   they must dislike and be enemies to all the manifestations of his
   character, and whatever he requires as most agreeable to him. Besides,
   the Bible relates many instances of this opposition to the truth, and
   predicts that the gospel would be opposed and rejected by men. Christ
   says to his disciples, "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst
   of wolves, and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake." And
   the Bible says, "The time will come, when men will not endure sound
   doctrine; and shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be
   turned unto fables." And it has been observed, that the present
   infidelity and wickedness which prevail in Christendom is particularly
   predicted in the Bible. Notwithstanding all this, we know the truth of
   the gospel is great, and will overcome; and that the gates of hell
   shall not prevail against it.

   Finally: We know that the Bible could not be invented and forged by
   dishonest, wicked men; for this is for many reasons not only
   improbable, but impossible. And we know that no honest, good men would
   have any hand in it, if it were a forgery. It follows that the very
   existence of it, in the form in which it is, is a demonstration that it
   came from God, and was written by divine inspiration. We have as great
   and full evidence of this, yea, greater, than we have of the existence
   of the visible world, or of any thing which we perceive by our bodily
   senses. [2]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] 1. Cor. xv. 19, "If in this life only we have hope Christ, we are
   of all men most miserable." These words have been understood by some in
   a sense which may be thought inconsistent with the sentiments expressed
   in the above paragraph. But on a careful examination, they will
   doubtless appear in perfect unison. To hope in Christ only in this
   life, is really to give up the Christian hope, and Christianity itself,
   as a groundless fable; and consequently to be deprived of all the
   enjoyment and happiness derived from Christianity, and the Christian
   hope, by which they have an unspeakably higher enjoyment, and greater
   degree of happiness, than unbelievers can have. And as they feel the
   vanity of all things in this world, their loss is irreparable, and they
   must feel themselves wretched, and sink into gloom, despair and misery:
   while the men of the world, by their ignorance, delusion and a worldly
   mind, knowing no greater good than they have or hope to obtain in the
   enjoyments of this life, are eagerly pursuing and fondly hoping for
   worldly good; by which they are, at present, prevented failing into
   that despair and misery, which will certainly come upon them, when this
   life shall end.

   [2] The above evidences of the truth and divine origin of Christianity,
   it is supposed every Christian is, or ought to be, able to produce on
   all proper occasions. Others are omitted, together with answers to the
   objections which are made to the Bible, because every Christian may not
   be supposed able readily to exhibit them. A more ample and able
   vindication of Christianity is contained in Dr. Trumbull's Twelve
   Sermons on the Divine Origin of the Holy Scriptures, and Mr. Fuller's
   treatise entitled, Christianity its own Evidence, &c; both which are
   recommended as worthy of the perusal of all.

   The same Subject continued.

   1 Peter, iii. 15. And he ready always to give an answer to every man
   that asketh you a reason of the hope that it in you, with meekness and
   fear.

   SECONDLY. Christians, in giving the reason of the hope that is in them,
   must give the reason, not only of their belief and assurance that the
   gospel is true, and a revelation from heaven; but also the reason of
   their hope that they do cordially embrace it, and are interested in all
   the blessings which are promised to all true believers. When they, in
   proper times and circumstances, are asked the reason of this their
   hope, by those who appear to want information, and to have a right to
   it, and it may promote a good and important end, they can make the
   following answer.

   We all hope that we, are friends to Christ, and are interested in the
   promises he has made to those who believe in him. But our hope is
   stronger or weaker at different times, according to the strength and
   constancy, or weakness and inconstancy, of our religious exercises, and
   the consciousness we have of them, and the sight of our own hearts. We
   sometimes attain a degree of assurance, or that confidence which
   excludes all sensible doubts.; but many of us, perhaps the most, have
   often many doubts, and some of us have generally many doubts and fears.
   Others are generally more confident, and seldom if ever doubt of their
   being real Christians. What is the cause of this difference it is
   impossible for us to determine; at least in many cases. But this we are
   confident of, that it is owing to our imperfection in knowledge,
   discerning, or Christian exercises, if we be real Christians, that we
   have the least doubt of it, and do not always enjoy joy an assurance
   that we are friends to Christ. At the same time we believe that the
   reason why some real Christians do not admit a doubt of their being
   Christians, is, their imperfection in knowledge, discerning, and
   Christian experience. There are others who profess to be assured
   constantly, without one doubt for a long course of years, that they are
   Christians, and shall be saved, whose life and conversation discover
   that they know not what it is to be a real Christian. But we will
   proceed to give the reason of our hope.

   In the first place we would observe, that we trust we have been
   convinced of sin, and reproved for it, by the Spirit of God, as none
   are but those to whom he applies the benefits of redemption. Antecedent
   to our hearts being renewed by divine power to new and gracious
   exercises, we were, the most of us, if not all, brought to a degree of
   painful conviction of our sinful and miserable condition, which we
   believe is the way which God commonly takes with those whom he designs
   to save. But as such conviction, and the exercises that accompany it,
   are so different in different persons, as to their degree, the length
   of their continuance, the attempts and exertions they make to help
   themselves, and the particular means by which they have taken place and
   continued; we shall not try to give account of them, which every one
   may do for himself, when it may be convenient. Besides, it would be
   deviating from our present purpose, which is, to give the reason of our
   hope that we are Christians, to enter into a description of the
   convictions of which the unregenerate may be the subjects. For no
   convictions or exercises which take place in the mind of a sinner,
   antecedent to his regeneration, or his having a new heart, can be any
   scriptural evidence that he ever will be renewed and become a
   Christian. There is no connection in nature, or by the declarations and
   promises of scripture, between any convictions and exercises of the
   unregenerate, and their becoming Christians. In any stage or degree of
   their convictions, change of sentiments, or external reformation, all
   may come to a full stop, and be lost; or, if they continue in any
   degree, they may never issue in a true conversion. We therefore mean to
   speak only of that conviction of sin, and humiliation for it, which is
   an evidence of our being regenerated, as it can take place only in a
   renewed heart, and is connected with salvation.

   Our eyes have been opened to see that the law of God, which requires
   our obedience to it, respects the heart and every motion and exercise
   of it which is of a moral nature, requiring that they all should be
   perfectly right and in conformity to it, and forbidding every thing
   contrary to this rectitude of heart, on pain of eternal punishment;
   that this law is perfectly right and good in all the requirements and
   threatenings of it. This has been attended with a conviction of the
   exceeding wickedness of our hearts, being wholly contrary to the law of
   God, and the source of every thing wrong in our outward actions. We
   could not but approve of the law as right, holy and good, and felt that
   we were wholly blameable for every thing in our heart and life contrary
   to this law, and were wholly without excuse. Our heart appeared to us
   to be naturally wholly depraved and wicked, and all sin against God so
   infinitely criminal and vile, and we so unspeakably guilty, having done
   nothing: but sinning against God and his law, that we felt and
   acknowledged from the heart that we deserved to have the penalty of the
   law executed upon us, that God would be just and glorious in doing it,
   and we must justify him in it, and remain forever without the least
   reason of complaint. Thus we submitted to God, and accepted the
   punishment of our iniquity, and felt a calmness and pleasure we never
   experienced before, in viewing with delight the divine character
   exhibited in his law, and works of creation and providence. We knew our
   heart to be naturally so totally depraved and wicked, hard, obstinate
   and impenitent, that it would never be made better by us, or by any
   means or creature, unless it were renewed by the almighty power of God,
   which he was binder no obligation to do; that we were utterly undone
   and lost in ourselves, that we were in the hands of God, as the clay is
   in the hand of the potter, to deal with us according to his sovereign
   pleasure and we heartily acquiesced in this, in being thus dependent on
   him. And when we were brought to a. more particular and realizing view
   of Christ, and the way of salvation by him, (of which we shall speak
   presently) our sins and the evil that is in our heart appeared in a
   worse light to us, and unspeakably aggravated, in that it was necessary
   that Christ should suffer so much to make atonement for sin, in which
   such great and astonishing love to sinners was manifested. Our abuse of
   the gospel, and disposition to slight and reject Jesus Christ, of which
   we had been actually guilty in ways and instances innumerable, appeared
   to us great and aggravated beyond description, and discovered the
   exceeding malignity and baseness of our heart; the wickedness and
   obstinacy in refusing to accept Christ offering himself clothed with
   love and salvation. Oh, who can express or fully conceive of the
   magnitude and aggravations of the sin of impenitence and unbelief, of
   which they are guilty who live under the gospel, and will not embrace
   it!

   Thus we have been convinced of sin, and reproved. for it, and we trust
   have submitted to the reproof in the exercise of repentance,
   condemnation, shame and abhorrence of ourselves. We think this is
   described by Christ when he says, "And when he is come (that is, the
   Holy Spirit) he will reprove the world of sin: of sin, because they
   believe not on me." And here we would observe, that this conviction of
   sin, from the beginning of it, and in its progress, has been attended
   with an evidence to us that the Bible is true and from God, in that it
   describes the character of man to be the lame which we found ours to
   be, when we saw the depravity and wickedness of our hearts. This
   description is given in the relation of the facts by which men in
   different circumstances have in all generations acted out and
   discovered the depravity and great degree of wickedness of their
   hearts, and in the many particular assertions of the great and total
   depravity of the human heart. And the gospel is founded on this, that
   mankind are all sinners to such a degree that they are wholly lost and
   undone, dead in trespasses and sin, enemies to God, and under the curse
   of the law, which is vindicated and honoured, both in the commands and
   threatenings of it, by the gospel: and it asserts that man is naturally
   so under the power of sin that he hates the light of truth, and will
   not come to it, but chooses to remain in the darkness of sin, till he
   is born from above, and has a new heart given to him. We are assured
   that no men not inspired by God would have written such a book, which
   represents man in a light so contrary to what men naturally think of
   themselves, or ever would have thought of it. We are sensible that our
   ignorance of ourselves, before we were convinced of our own sinfulness,
   as we have been describing it, was the ground of our ignorance of the
   Bible, and our criminal disregard to it, and by this conviction we have
   been confirmed in the truth of divine revelation, as we never were
   before. And we are certain beyond a doubt, that all the professed and
   open infidelity, or secret disbelief of the truth of the gospel, is
   owing to a want of a true and real conviction of sin. And in this view,
   we do not wonder at their unbelief; for how can they who are so wholly
   ignorant of their own moral character, and of their standing in any
   need of the provision made in the gospel, believe and embrace it? How
   can they believe who are proud, and have so high an opinion of
   themselves, and seek honour one of another? As well may they who feel
   themselves perfectly sound and whole, think they want a physician.

   We would observe further, that the conviction of sin and reproof for it
   has not been a transient thing, which soon palled away and was
   forgotten: contrary to this, it abides by us, continues and increases.
   Our hope of pardon of all our sins, and of salvation by Christ, does
   not abate, but increases it. We lee more and more the evil nature of
   sin, and the ill desert of it, as we increase in our sense of the
   righteousness and excellency of the law of God, the wisdom of the
   gospel, and the worthiness and glory of God and the Redeemer. And we
   daily see more and more of the sinfulness of our own hearts, our
   indwelling depravity, that sin cleaves to us in all our exercises, and
   defiles them. We have an increasing sense of our desert of everlasting
   destruction; of our constant and absolute dependence on Christ, his
   atonement and righteousness, for pardon and justification, and to renew
   our hearts, and for every right thought and exercise, of which
   assistance and grace we are infinitely unworthy; therefore, if we shall
   be saved, it must be all of free, undeserved grace. This conviction and
   sense of sin, and of our own helplessness and infinite unworthiness,
   accompanies all our exercises of religion and piety, as essential to
   them, and increases as we grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our
   Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

   We proceed to say, when we were led to a particular view of Jesus
   Christ, his character, work and design, all this appeared as a reality,
   and the wisdom, love and grace of God shined in him and the way of
   salvation by him, in a new, glorious and affecting light. And we could
   not but highly approve of all this, and the whole character of Christ,
   and were filled with wonder and pleasure. We saw there was all fulness
   in Christ, enough to supply every want of such sinners as we were; that
   there was every thing in him that we could desire, and nothing
   undesirable; and that all he has for sinners is freely offered, without
   money and without price, to all who are willing to accept of it. This
   view and sense of heart of the truth of the gospel, and of the
   worthiness and excellence of Christ, and approbation of his character,
   and the way of salvation by him, is so fixed in our hearts, that we
   have never lost it, though it is sometimes more clear, impressive and
   affecting than at others.

   Thus we have described the conviction and reproof we had of sin, and
   our consequent view and approbation of Christ and the gospel, as some
   of us have sensibly experienced these in this order, and it is the
   order of nature; for it is impossible that any man who is not Convinced
   of sin and reproved for it, so as to submit to God, approve of his
   character as legislator; and of his Jaw, should understand and approve
   of the gospel. Though there may be some, yea, many of us, who have not
   so distinctly and sensibly discerned the operations of their own minds
   as to ascertain the order in which their convictions and exercises took
   place, yet they are sensible they have had them all, as to substance,
   sooner or later, in a greater or less degree. Some of us have remained
   a longer and more sensible time, after we submitted to God in the
   manner which has been described, before we hid clear and affecting
   views of Christ and the gospel, than others, and our views of the
   latter have been more gradual. Others have had all crowded on their
   minds so much at once as not to be able to distinguish the former from
   the latter, so as to say which was first or last, from the perception
   of their own minds. And there is a great variety in the degree, way and
   manner, time and means, in and by which these things have taken place
   in different persons. Yet the work and effect appear to be the same, as
   to substance and the essentials of it.

   Not one of us have entertained a hope that we shall be saved, or have
   been led to approve of the gospel, and become friendly to God and his
   law, wholly from a persuasion somehow impressed on our minds, that
   Christ died for us and would save us, or something like this: for it is
   impossible that such a persuasion, be it ever so dear and strong,
   should be true, and therefore must be false, and a great and dangerous
   delusion: and they whose religion is built on this foundation only, are
   building on the sand, and going to inevitable ruin.

   Our hope that we belong to Christ, and shall be saved by him, is built
   on the evidence we think we have that we have cordially embraced the
   gospel, and have been brought to the exercise of the Christian graces,
   such as repentance, faith in Christ, love to God, our fellow Christians
   and our neighbours, or any of those Christian graces which are implied
   in these, and connected with them. Some of us, we believe, have, at
   their first conversion, had such clear and impressive views of the
   truth and excellence of the gospel, that they not only knew it was
   divine, but also that they did embrace it with all their heart, and
   strength of mind; that they were turned from darkness to marvellous
   light, and consequently should be saved; and the Spirit of God has so
   excited holy affections, and shined on his own work, as to be a witness
   with their spirits that they were born of God: and some have been so
   happy as to enjoy this evidence all their days, without much
   interruption; especially those who have been called to labour and
   suffer much for the cause of Christ and religion. There are others who
   at the time or their conversion have had such great light and strong
   affections, that they were confident, without the least doubt, that
   they had passed from death to life, who yet have soon fallen into
   darkness and doubts, whether they were really converted or not: others,
   who have had such mistaken notions about conversion, and the feelings
   and exercises in which it consisted, and of Christians, previous to
   their own conversion and after it, that when they really passed this
   change they did not know, and had not one thought that they were
   converted then, and for a considerable time after. But as real
   Christian exercises continued, and perhaps on some occasions rose
   higher, upon reflection on their own past experience and exercises,
   they have entertained a hope that they were real Christians; and the
   evidence of this has increased on passing through trials, and their
   hope has grown into a confidence which often excludes all doubt. All
   these differences, and those which have been before mentioned, and many
   others not mentioned, may and do take place among real Christians, from
   causes and for reasons which we do not pretend to be able fully to
   explore and explain. If they have been convinced of sin; have submitted
   to God, and embraced the gospel in the manner before stated; and have
   and exhibit the further evidence that they are Christians which we now
   proceed to mention; they may reasonably think themselves such, and must
   be embraced by us as the friends of Christ.

   Our evidence that we have really embraced the gospel, by which our hope
   is supported and strengthened, arises from those exercises, and the
   conduct, which have attended or followed the things which have been
   already mentioned.

   When we understood and believed the gospel, as before described, it had
   a powerful influence on our hearts and affections, which is lasting,
   and never wholly lost; at some times less sensible, at others more so,
   and is on the whole, we hope, increasing. We were brought into a new
   moral and spiritual world, and our affections were taken off from the
   things, the enjoyments and pleasures of this world, on which they were
   before fixed, as the great and chief good; and fixed on the infinitely
   important, glorious and beautiful objects of the invisible and
   spiritual world revealed in the Bible. Our minds have been so renewed
   and transformed by divine power accompanying the gospel, we hope, that
   we have no longer lived unto ourselves; but have with strong affection
   devoted ourselves to Christ, and given ourselves away to him, to serve
   him, and promote his honour and interest. And in our attention to his
   character, and the truths contained in the gospel, our affections and
   the exercises of our minds are excited to a higher degree and greater
   strength than they ever were towards any worldly object, or possibly
   could be: at the same time we are conscious that they are not flighty
   and imaginary, but solid and rational. We feel a fixed determination
   and resolution to follow Christ, and adhere to the practice of
   Christianity, by divine assistance: and whatever we were before, and
   though some of us were openly vicious, we are, by the knowledge of the
   gospel, and the power it has had on our hearts, become strictly
   conscientious, in all our thoughts, exercises of heart, words and
   actions; watchful and careful that they all may be conformable to the
   divine commands. And what is found contrary to these in our hearts, of
   which we see much, we lament, and, with pain and sorrow, condemn. As to
   all external vicious conduct in words and actions, we hope we are
   thoroughly reformed, and condemn and abhor ourselves for being guilty
   of them, and for all our sins; and have an earnest longing to be
   delivered from all sin, and to become perfectly holy, which we hops is
   what Christ means by "hungering and thirsting after righteousness." We
   think this change in us could not be wrought by any thing short of
   divine power, accompanying the gospel, by which it has been made unto
   us "the power of God unto our salvation." And we hope we have received
   "the spirit of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."

   We hope we have received from God the spirit of love, such love which
   in the nature and exercises of it differs from all kinds of love
   natural to man, and is peculiar to Christians, and conformable to the
   moral character of God, which consists in love. This love consists most
   essentially in disinterested good will, or goodness of heart. This has
   fixed our hearts in the first place and chiefly on God, in cordial and
   strong desires that he may be exalted, infinitely blessed and glorified
   forever, and readiness to devote ourselves to answer this end; and when
   we reflect on the subject, and learn that God is glorifying himself by
   every thing that has, does or will take place to eternity, we are
   highly pleased, and rejoice. And when we consider that the work of
   redemption by Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is suited to make the
   greatest display of the divine perfections, both in them who shall be
   saved and in them who perish; and that all the sin and misery that do
   or ever shall take place, will serve to praise and glorify Christ, and
   promote the greatest possible good of the universe; and that Christ
   will bring the redeemed and all the friends of God to the highest
   happiness and glory in his eternal kingdom, even to unspeakably greater
   happiness than could possibly have taken place if no sin and misery had
   ever existed, and consequently there could have been no such character
   as that of God manifested in the flesh, and no such works as he has
   done to glorify God and redeem the elect; when we consider and realize
   all this, we are filled with comfort, wonder and joy, finding in this
   divine plan all that benevolence can wish, even the highest possible
   good of the universe. This is an object suited in the highest possible
   degree to please the benevolent, and to raise their gratitude to the
   highest pitch to the God of love, and Redeemer of men.

   This same love, which fixes our hearts on God, and renders us friendly
   to his being, felicity and glory, and causes us to rejoice that he will
   be glorified, and produce the greatest good of which the created
   universe is capable, unites us also to all the friends of God;
   especially the friends of Christ among men, whom we consider as our
   brethren and sisters in Christ, who bear the image of Christ in their
   hearts, and are friends to, and labouring to promote, his interest
   among men, in which we also are engaged; who are the special objects of
   the benevolence, complacency and delight of Christ. For these we have a
   peculiar friendship, desiring and rejoicing in their welfare, loving to
   serve them, and do them all the good we can; and we have a peculiar
   complacency and delight in them and their friendship, conversation and
   company, which we cannot enjoy in others. This, we hope, is that love
   of our brethren which in the scripture is connected with love to God,
   and is peculiar to true Christians.

   We hope we have that benevolent, universal love to all our fellow men
   which is peculiar to Christians, which leads us to wish them the
   greatest good they are capable of enjoying in this life and in the
   world to come, and to do good as far as we have an opportunity. And we
   hope we love even our enemies, so that whatever evil they do, or
   attempt or desire to do us, this does not make us to cease to wish them
   well, and to do them all the good we can, and to pray heartily for
   their welfare; always studying and endeavouring, if it be possible, to
   live in peace with all men.

   We have been led by our acquaintance with Christ and the gospel, we
   hope, in some good measure to keep our bodies under, and crucify the
   flesh with the affections and lusts; to avoid all intemperance and
   unlawful sensual indulgence, and lay aside passion, anger, envy and
   malice; and to put on humility, meekness, and a calm and quiet spirit;
   and to practise that self-denial, and government of ourselves, our
   appetites and particular propensities and inclinations, according to
   the holy rules of the gospel, so as not to injure ourselves or any one
   else by the criminal indulgence of them. We hope our selfishness or
   covetousness, pride and levity of mind have been so far subdued as not
   to reign in us; and that the contrary principles of benevolence,
   humility and sober-mindedness have dominion in our hearts; that we set
   our affection on things above, and not on things on the earth; that we
   see the vanity of the world and the things and enjoyments of it; and
   are impressed with a sense of the reality, importance and excellence of
   the things and enjoyments of religion, and feel unhappy when these
   things are in any measure out of sight, and our religious exercises
   respecting them do sensibly subside.

   We love and greatly prize the Bible. It is better to us than all the
   riches in the world, or than all other books. We also prize and read
   the books which serve to explain the Bible, and vindicate the doctrines
   and duties contained in it. We have great delight in reading and
   meditating on the Bible, especially at times, when the truths we find
   there are impressed on our minds. We make the Bible the rule of our
   faith and practice.

   We spend much time, when we are alone especially, in meditating on the
   subjects of religion, and are pleased with religious conversation in
   the company of Christians. We have great pleasure in secret prayer,
   especially when, as we think, the Holy Spirit enlarges our hearts and
   helps our infirmities, in a clear and affecting view of divine things.
   We are pleased with joining with others in social worship when we have
   opportunity, either in the families where we live, in private Christian
   societies, or in public assemblies. The Christian sabbath, and the
   institution of baptism and the Lord's supper, appear to us to be wise
   and good, suited to promote the highest good of men, and the honour of
   Christ, and we endeavour conscientiously to attend upon them; and are
   much instructed and edified by the preaching of the gospel, when the
   great truths of it are explained and vindicated, and the duties therein
   revealed are properly urged, and the preacher with suitable engagedness
   declares all the counsel of God.

   We hope we live in the exercise of an unconditional submission to God,
   without making any reserve, with respect to all the events which do or
   shall take place, whether greater or smaller, and whether they relate
   more immediately to ourselves, or to the church, or to the world in
   general. We firmly believe that God has determined, and does order,
   every thing, every event, both great and small, that comes to pass,
   according to the counsel of his own will, which is perfectly wise and
   good; and we are disposed and love to say, Thy will be done, with
   respect to all events which do take place now, or shall come to pass.
   Nor do we, and we dare not, ask for any thing in prayer to God which we
   do not know is agreeable to his will to grant, absolutely, but
   conditionally, if it be agreeable to his will to do it; if it be not,
   we are prepared to say from the heart. Thy will be done. We have such a
   constant conviction and confidence that the divine will is infinitely
   wise, right and good, that it is matter of support, comfort and joy,
   that the Lord God Omnipotent reigns, and hath done, and will forever
   do, whatsoever pleaseth him, being infinitely above all controul; so
   that his counsel standeth forever, and the thoughts of his heart to all
   generations.

   We add in the last place, that we trust that our conversation and
   conduct before the world is agreeable to our Christian profession, and
   the holy rules of the gospel. If this were not true, but the contrary,
   we acknowledge all our supposed inward exercises, which have been
   mentioned as evidences of our Christianity, are not to be relied upon
   by us. and may be justly considered as mere delusion by all others. But
   if what we suppose be true, for which we appeal to all who are
   acquainted with us, and we have been brought by the influence of the
   gospel of the grace God to deny all ungodliness, and every worldly
   lust, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present evil
   world; we think it to be a strengthening evidence, in connection with
   our inward convictions and exercises which we have experienced, and
   have now related, that we are the subjects of the power of Divine
   Grace; and that, whatever we once were, we are now washed, and
   sanctified, and justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the
   Spirit of our God; and that all who behold our blameless and good
   conversation in Christ, ought to consider it as an evidence in our
   favour, and of the truth and excellence of Christianity; and that they
   who speak evil of us as of evil doers, and falsely accuse us, ought to
   be ashamed.

   Thus we have endeavoured to give an honest and true account of the
   reason of the hope we entertain, that by believing the gospel it is
   become the power of God to us, to our salvation. We have omitted some
   things which might have been mentioned, and perhaps have made some
   needless repetitions. Imperfect as this account is, we wish it may
   prove some advantage to Christians, and matter of conviction to
   unbelievers. [3]

   III. The reasonableness and importance of the direction and command
   which has been explained, is to be considered and proved. This may be
   done by the following observations.

   1. It must be supposed that every real Christian is able to comply with
   this direction, and can give the reason of his hope, when properly
   inquired of and asked. If this were not true, the command, which
   extends to all Christians, would be indeed unreasonable and nugatory.
   It is therefore reasonable to suppose and be certain that every
   Christian has good reason for the hope that is in him, and can give it
   when there is a call for it. This is a subject which he thinks upon and
   studies more than any other. He certainly does meditate upon it night
   and day. He considers and examines over and over again the evidence he
   has of the truth and divinity of Christianity. The theme is familiar to
   his mind, and the evidence of the truth increases, in his view, in
   strength and clearness; and, of course, he is constantly, and with
   solemn concern, considering the evidence he has of his being a real
   Christian. He must therefore be always ready to give the reason of this
   hope that is in him. And it is reasonable and important that Christians
   should do this, when asked, because,

   2. It is greatly for the advantage and benefit of Christians to be
   prepared and ready to give the reason of their hope, and actually to do
   it, when they are asked in a proper manner.

   This has a greater tendency to keep their minds awake to these subjects
   than mere private meditation; to increase their knowledge in these
   things, and to strengthen and invigorate their exercises, and establish
   their own hearts in the ground and reason of their hope. Free and
   serious conversation upon interesting subjects of religion is attended
   with advantages to Christians, which could not be enjoyed if every one
   kept all his religious thoughts and exercises wholly to himself. This
   is confirmed by reason and the experience of Christians. And many, if
   not all, have found, by communicating to others the reasons of their
   belief in Christianity, and of their hope that they themselves were
   Christians, their hearts more established in the truth and importance
   of the Bible, and their hope of salvation by Christ become more clear
   and strong, by being quickened in their religious exercises.

   3. A compliance with this command tends, many ways, to the good of
   others. It tends greatly to the benefit of Christians to converse with
   each other freely on these subjects; to communicate to one another
   their reasons for believing the gospel, and how, and in what way, they
   were brought to a clear conviction and assurance of the truth and
   divinity of it; and what have been their views and exercises, on which
   they ground their hope that they do cordially embrace the gospel, and
   are the real friends of Christ. By this they become particularly
   acquainted with each other, and obtain the knowledge of the discerning,
   views and exercises of their hearts, which could not be so well and
   fully obtained in any other way. This lays a foundation for an
   intimacy, love and friendship, which are sweet, edifying, lasting, and
   peculiar to Christians. This tends to increase the knowledge of
   Christians, and establish their hearts in the belief of the truth, and
   excite and quicken their Christian affections, while they hear others
   give the reason of the hope that is in them. And this appears to be an
   important part of Christian communion, while they drink into the same
   Spirit, and mutually partake of the comfort and blessings of the
   gospel.

   This also has a tendency to promote the best good of unbelievers. If
   Christians have nothing to say for themselves, and are silent, when
   they who are not Christians, with apparent serious desire to know, ask
   them to give the reason of their hope, this will greatly tend to
   prejudice them against Christianity and professed Christians, and lead
   them to think that the gospel is unreasonable, and cannot be supported.
   But when they find Christians able and ready to give the reason of
   their hope, when asked, and they have it laid before them, they have
   matter of conviction that Christians can speak for themselves, and that
   Christianity is founded in reason and truth; and it may by divine
   influence reach their hearts, as the means of their salvation. And
   doubtless this has been the means of the salvation of many. But if this
   should not be the happy consequence, and the unbeliever persist in
   rejecting the gospel to his own destruction, the Christian has done his
   duty; and his labour shall not be in vain in the Lord, but answer some
   important end.

   4. In this way Christians honour Christ and his cause. They who are not
   able, or are not disposed, to give the reason of their Christian hope
   when properly asked to do it, must be numbered among those who are
   ashamed of Christ and of his words. Of such, He says, shall the Son of
   Man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of the Father, with the
   holy angels. He will consider and treat them as a disgrace and
   dishonour to him, should he own them to be his disciples and friends.
   But, on the contrary, he says, "Whosoever shall confess me before men,
   him will I confess also before my Father who is in heaven, and before
   the angels of God." As these, by confessing him before men, honour
   him., he will honour them before the universe, in his state of the
   highest exaltation and glory. They who are able and ready to give the
   reason of their Christian hope to those who ask them, to whatever shame
   and sufferings they may expose themselves by this, do hereby confess
   and honour Christ before men, which they cannot do effectually in any
   other way, if this be refused or neglected. And this is one important
   way for Christians to exhibit their true character, and show their zeal
   and courage in the cause of Christ, and honour and promote it in the
   world. How reasonable then and important is this injunction of the
   Apostle!

IMPROVEMENT.

   I. FROM this text, and the subject, we have warrant to conclude, that
   they who are not able to give a reason for their hope in the sense
   explained, or they who refuse to do it to any one, at any time, are not
   real Christians, whatever they may pretend.

   There are too many, who would pass for Christians, who can give no good
   reason why they believe Christianity to be true and divine, or why they
   hope to be saved by it. They can give no account of any particular,
   sensible impressions made on their hearts by any of the truths of the
   gospel, or of any view or exercise which indicates a real change of
   heart. There are others to whom the general arguments for the truth of
   the gospel are familiar, and they can talk well and readily upon some
   of them; but if they be asked what their own inward exercises are with
   respect to the gospel, and what is the ground of their hope that they
   are Christians, their mouths are immediately shut, and they have
   nothing to say, unless it be to object against the propriety of asking
   or answering such a question, as no one has any business to inquire, or
   right to know, what are their inward exercises; every one ought to keep
   these to himself, &c. Others will inveigh against Christians telling
   their experiences, as it is called, and insist it is nothing but mere
   enthusiasm. All these may be justly considered as having no good reason
   for hoping themselves to be Christians.

   There are others who are forward enough, and even too forward, to tell
   of their religious experiences, and give a narrative of their
   conversion, which they seem to think to be extraordinary and excellent.
   And they do it when there does not appear any particular call to do it.
   They appear to be proud of their religious experiences, and often speak
   of them in a light and ostentatious manner, directly contrary to
   meekness and fear. These are so far from obeying the Apostle's
   direction, that they abuse and pervert it, and do not appear to be real
   Christians.

   II. It hence appears how reasonable and important it is that Christians
   should give the reason of their hope, when they join to a church, and
   make a Christian profession; and that they should be asked concerning
   their doctrinal knowledge, and experience of the power of divine truths
   on their hearts. Churches have a right to know of such the reason of
   their hope, and with what views, exercises and motives they desire to
   join them. And by this means they get acquainted with them as they
   could not in any other way, and a foundation is laid for future
   intimacy and Christian communion. They therefore must be blameable, and
   give reason to fear they are not Christians, who refuse to join a
   church be cause they cannot be admitted unless they will give the
   reason of their hope, as above explained. And those churches are guilty
   of great and criminal neglect who admit members without any examination
   of them respecting their doctrinal and experimental knowledge of
   religion, or asking them to give the reason of their hope. The
   consequence generally is, that the members of such churches have no
   particular intimacy or acquaintance with each other, not so much as
   they have with the men of the world, or those who make no profession of
   religion; and know little or nothing of each other, and are in no
   respect distinguished from non-professors, but merely by having made a
   profession, and meeting together at the Lord's table.

   III. This subject is suited to awaken Christians to a concern to be
   ready, and more ready than Christians in general have been and are, to
   give an answer to those who ask them the reason of the hope that is in
   them. They ought to strive to be yet better able to offer the most
   clear and convincing evidence of the truth, authenticity and excellence
   of Christianity, and to increase in the strength and constancy of every
   Christian grace; that they may have increasing evidence in their own
   minds that their hope is well founded, and be able to give more
   satisfying and striking evidence to others that they are Christians
   indeed; and so shine as lights in the world, in the midst of a crooked
   and perverse nation.

   Christians have no reason to be ashamed of their hope and the gospel,
   let who will speak against and ridicule it. It has and will stand the
   test of the most severe rational trial and examination. The more it is
   examined by unprejudiced reason, the brighter its truth and divine
   excellency shine; and it will stand and prevail, until the light of it
   shall fill the world, as the waters cover the sea, and all the opposers
   of it shall be turned into everlasting darkness. Wherefore let
   Christians gird up the loins of their mind, be sober, and hope to the
   end, for the grace which is to be brought unto them at the revelation
   of Jesus Christ; and be always ready to give an answer to every man
   that asketh them the reason of the hope that is in them, with meekness
   and fear.

   There is a special reason for a careful, courageous practice of this
   apostolic direction, at this day, which is the time in which the sixth
   vial is poured out, predicted Revelation sixteenth chapter, when the
   spirits of devils are allowed to go forth to the inhabitants of the
   whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of God
   Almighty. These evil spirits are now among us, and have great influence
   on the minds of men, in the uncommon, rapid spread of infidelity, and
   all manner of error and vice. Christians therefore now have a loud and
   special call to watch and be sober, to vindicate the truth, and honour
   Christ and his cause in all possible ways. Let them hear and obey the
   words of Christ, which he spake with particular reference to this time:
   "Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his
   garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame."

   [3] It is supposed that the evidence given above by Christians, of
   their hope of a saving interest in Christ, is common to every real
   Christian, without which no man has reason to think himself to be one.
   But in many other particulars, not mentioned here, Christians may
   differ, and one have views and exercises which another has not
   experienced in the same manner and degree, which may be a strengthening
   evidence to those who have them, and to those to whom they relate them,
   that they have tasted that the Lord is gracious. If any desire to see
   the subject treated more largely, they are referred to President
   Edwards on Religious Affections.

SERMON III.

    WRITTEN IN THE YEAR. I767.

   On Christian Friendship, as it subsists between Christ and Believers,
   and between Believers themselves.

   Cant. v. 16. This is my beloved, and this is my friend.

   FRIENDSHIP affords the highest and most sweet enjoyment that is to be
   had in this life, or that rational creatures are capable of. Yea, it is
   in some sense the only source of real enjoyment and happiness; so that
   to be perfectly without this, in every kind and degree of it, is to be
   wholly destitute of all true enjoyment and comfort. This gives pleasure
   and sweetness to all other enjoyments, and without this they all fade,
   and become insipid and worthless; yea, every thing will be rather a
   burden, and worse than nothing: whereas, this will give a degree of
   enjoyment and pleasure, when stripped of every other good; so that he
   who is in circumstances to exercise and enjoy friendship is in a degree
   happy, let his situation and condition otherwise be what it may: and it
   is impossible he should be perfectly miserable, so long as he is within
   reach of this sweet, this heaven-born cordial.

   It is probable that the most voluptuous sensualist that lives would in
   a great measure lose his high relish for the pleasures he is so eagerly
   pursuing, and all his sweets would be turned into bitterness, if he
   should feel himself perfectly, and in every sense, friendless: for none
   can be found, however sunk and sordid their minds have become by vice,
   who have no sort of taste for friendship; though it may be, on the
   whole, a very corrupt taste. To be sure, if any such may be found, they
   seem to be sunk, in this respect, below the brutal creation; for it is
   observed that among them there is an appearance of love of society, and
   at lead a resemblance of love and friendship.

   However lost to all true friendship mankind in general are, yet a
   desire of the esteem and love of others is found in every breast, and
   is as essential to man as a desire of happiness; and therefore cannot
   be rooted out, but by destroying his natural powers, by which he will
   cease to be man.

   Hence it is that no inconsiderable part of the future misery of the
   wicked will consist in feeling themselves perfectly friendless, and the
   objects of the hatred and contempt of all intelligent existence in the
   universe, while they find themselves in every respect in the most
   wretched, deplorable circumstances, and have a most keen aversion to
   being hated and contemned, and a strong desire of the love and esteem
   of others.

   As real or disinterested benevolence is essential to true friendship,
   we have reason to think there are but few instances of it in this
   degenerate, selfish world; and where it does take place in any degree,
   it is in a very low and imperfect one; so that what many in all ages
   have been convinced of and asserted from long experience, may be relied
   upon as a certain truth, that this is a friendless world. However,
   there is a sort of friendship, which is at bottom a merely selfish
   thing, being founded only in self-love, or which is the result of what
   may be called instinct, or natural affection; which is very common, and
   in many instances rises very high, and answers many valuable purposes
   to mankind in this present state, it being many ways of great service
   to mankind, as it prevents many evils that would otherwise take place,
   and promotes the good of society, and often gives a degree of pleasure
   and enjoyment. But, so far as true virtue or holiness takes place, a
   foundation is laid for a different kind of friendship, which is
   immensely higher, more noble and excellent, and consists in exercises
   and enjoyments which surpass those of all other friendships, more than
   the exercises and enjoyments of improved reason excel those of a brute,
   or the brightness of the meridian sun, that of the meanest glow-worm.

   And God has, in his adorable wisdom and goodness, contrived and
   provided that this friendship should be exercised and enjoyed in the
   highest perfection, being raised to the greatest possible heights,
   attended with the best and most advantageous circumstances.

   The scripture leads us to conceive of the Deity as enjoying infinitely
   the most exalted and glorious friendship and society in himself, for
   which there is a foundation in the incomprehensible manner of his
   subsistence in the three persons of the adorable Trinity. Here eternal
   love and friendship takes place and flourishes to an infinite degree,
   in an infinitely the most perfect and glorious society, the ELOHIM, the
   Father, Son and Holy Ghost. And the society and friendship for which
   men are formed by holiness, without which they cannot be perfectly
   happy, may be considered as an imitation and image of this, by which
   they are made in the likeness of God, and partake with him in the same
   kind of happiness, which he enjoys to an infinite degree. And, in order
   that men might partake with him in the exercise and enjoyment of love
   and friendship to the highest degree and the greatest advantage, God
   has not only laid a plan to promote and effect the highest and most
   perfect love and friendship towards each other in the most exalted and
   happy society forever; but has so contrived, that they shall be brought
   into the nearest and most intimate union and friendly intercourse with
   himself, by which they shall in some sense, yea, to a great degree, be
   united to the Eternal and most Glorious, divine Society, and partake of
   the same river of enjoyment and pleasure, which proceeds from the
   throne of God and the Lamb, in a peculiar and eminent sense.

   To effect this in the best manner and to the greatest advantage, the
   invisible God, who eternally dwelt in the high and holy place,
   infinitely beyond the comprehension and reach of a creature, must come
   down, and make himself viable, that he might be the head, the life and
   soul of a visible and most glorious society. This has been done in the
   incarnation of the Son of God, by which the greatest purposes of God's
   moral kingdom are answered in the highest possible degree, and all
   happy intelligences, especially the redeemed from among men, are
   brought into a near union with God, and are under special advantages to
   receive communications from him, and enjoy his love and friendship in a
   manner and degree which could not have been in any other way. This is
   the mutual love and friendship spoken of in the text, which takes place
   between the incarnate Son of God, the divine Redeemer of lost men, and
   his church or spouse, or every one of the redeemed.

   He is in a peculiar and distinguished sense the friend of the redeemed;
   and he is the beloved of their soul in a sense and degree in which no
   other person is, or can be: and hence there is a mutual love and
   friendship between them, which is beyond comparison the most intimate,
   intense, sweet and exalted of any thing of the kind between any other
   friends and lovers, unspeakably surpassing all other friendships in
   nature and degree, attended with the highest, most noble, transporting,
   foul-ravishing enjoyment and delight, that can possibly exist, or be
   conceived of.

   This union of hearts, this mutual love and friendship between Christ
   the Redeemer and Saviour, and believers in him, or the redeemed, is
   represented in scripture by the inclination and affection between the
   two sexes of which mankind consist, under the influence of which they
   mutually seek and come into a peculiar union and intimacy with each
   other, in which they may enjoy each other, and be happy in the exercise
   of mutual love and friendship. It is represented by the sweet love and
   affection between the bridegroom and his bride, and the mutual love and
   friendship, and solemn engagements, by which the husband and his spouse
   are united, and become one, and are happy in each other. And this
   similitude is, beyond doubt, most wisely and properly chosen, by which
   to represent this spiritual union and friendship, as it is in many
   respects the most lively, striking emblem and image of it that can be
   found in all nature; and is especially calculated to give men the best
   and most clear idea of it, and to give and keep up in their minds a
   conviction and sense of the reality, nature and happiness of such a
   union, love and friendship.

   This seems to be the design of this song from which the words of the
   text are taken. It is indeed a Love-song, in which the highest, most
   noble, pure and honourable love and friendship between Christ and his
   people is represented and celebrated under the similitude of two lovers
   whose hearts are united in the strongest, the most pure and sweetest
   love of esteem, benevolence and complacency, in the exercise of which
   they desire and seek the enjoyment of each other in the nearest union
   and greatest intimacy, in the near relation of husband and spouse. This
   is therefore called The Song of Songs, i.e. the most excellent song,
   especially the best and most excellent of all the songs of Solomon,
   which we are told were a thousand and five, as the theme, the subject
   and matter of it, is by far the most important, entertaining, excellent
   and sublime; in order to which Solomon was divinely inspired.

   As the virtuous, pious and pure love between a man and his spouse is in
   many respects the most lively and instructive image of the union and
   love between Christ and his church, God, in his wisdom and goodness,
   saw fit to give such a representation of it in a divine song, as what
   was greatly needed, and would be exceeding useful to his church and
   people. And though the carnal and inattentive, or those who are
   strangers to this divine love and friendship, may call it all
   foolishness, and in their boasted wisdom despise and ridicule it, or
   improve it only to carnal, low and obscene purposes; yet the children
   of true wisdom will justify the wisdom of God herein, and adore his
   goodness, while they find themselves instructed, quickened and edified
   hereby. And every true, chaste virgin who is espoused to Christ as the
   best friend and spiritual husband, will attend to it, and meditate upon
   it, with a peculiar relish, and sweet and holy delight, which
   unspeakably surpasses every thing the unholy soul can enjoy, or even
   imagine. The words of the text are the conclusion of the answer to a
   question put to the spouse, viz. What is thy beloved, more than another
   beloved? She readily answers, by giving a particular description of his
   charming beauties and superlative excellence, by which he is
   distinguished from all others, the chief among ten thousands; and then
   sums up all in one word, by saying, He is altogether lovely. He has the
   highest beauty, excellence and perfection, and has nothing else. Having
   thus given his character, she says, with reference to the question.
   This is my beloved, and this is my friend. This is the person, this is
   the character, with which I am so deeply in love; I am not ashamed to
   own him to be the beloved of my soul. And this is my best friend, whole
   heart is set on me, and he loves me as much as I can desire.

   The mutual love and friendship between Christ and the believer, you
   will observe, is expressed here. The true Christian has set his love on
   Christ; he is his beloved; he has given his heart to him, as to one who
   is the chief among ten thousands, and altogether lovely. And Christ
   loves him most tenderly, in the character of a true, faithful and
   all-sufficient friend and patron, and so returns love for love.

   The words do then lead us to attend to Christ, as he is here pointed
   out, in the character of the beloved friend of his people, the redeemed
   from among men.

   It may be said in general, that Christ, the glorious head and husband
   of his church, has every thing in him that can possibly come into the
   character of the best friend, and that to an inconceivable and infinite
   degree; and there is nothing belongs to him but what serves to complete
   and perfect this character; yea, he is at an infinite distance from
   every thing else. And his relation to his people, and all his conduct
   towards them, are such, and such are all the circumstances of this
   friendship, as to conspire to make it the most sweet, ravishing, noble
   and exalted that in the nature of things can be; and render him in the
   highest possible degree a desirable, worthy and excellent friend.

   But, for the better illustration of this point, the following
   particulars may be attended to.

   1. He is the most able friend, even an omnipotent and all-sufficient
   one. He can do whatever he pleases. He has a sufficiency of power and
   wisdom in all possible cases, and is perfectly able to do for his
   friends, who love and trust in him, whatever they need, or can possibly
   want to have done. All other friends are deficient in this respect:
   though they may have some sufficiency and ability to do some things for
   us, yet it is but infinitely little they can do, compared with what we
   want to have done. We are infinitely needy; and must be eternally most
   miserable and wretched, unless we have some friend to help us, who is
   fully able to go through with the work, and do all we want to have
   done, even in the most extreme, and, without such a friend, a desperate
   case. Now Christ is such a friend. he is understanding and wise,
   perfectly to know what our case is, and what we want, and what is the
   wisest and best way to afford relief, and supply all our wants; and he
   has full power to do whatever his wisdom dictates. And in this respect
   he is distinguished from all other persons in the universe; none but he
   was able to befriend us in the case in which we are. This will more
   fully appear, before we have done.

   2. He has the heart of a friend in all respects, and to the most
   perfect degree; or, he is willing and fully engaged to do all he can do
   for his people; all they can possibly want to have done in any case,
   and at any time. All other friends fail here. Though they are able to
   do but little for their friends comparatively, yet they nave not
   goodness enough to do all they can, in all cases, and at all times.
   They have not the heart of a friend to perf9Ction; so are not friendly
   to the utmost of their power at all times, but may be very unfriendly
   in some instances; therefore cannot be relied upon without caution, and
   danger of being disappointed. But Christ has the heart of a friend to
   infinite perfection, so that he can be relied upon in all cases,
   without any limits or danger. His benevolence to his people is without
   any bounds, and sufficient to surmount the greatest difficulties in the
   way of their good, and prompt him to do things infinitely great for
   them, and bestow on them the best and the greatest good, however
   unworthy and ill-deserving they are, and however criminal and vile
   their conduct has been towards him, in the most aggravated and horrid
   abuse of his goodness.

   3. He is a friend on whom we are dependent, and to whom we are indebted
   and beholden in the highest possible degree. This gives great advantage
   to love and friendship, where the friends and lovers are not equal, but
   one superior to the other, and the other's benefactor and saviour to
   such a degree as to lay his friend tinder the greatest obligations to
   love and gratitude, And the greater this dependence is, and the more
   one friend has received from, and is indebted to another, in this way,
   the more sweet and happy is the love and friendship between them. It is
   indeed contrary to pride, and an heart that is not formed for true
   friendship, to be thus united to such a superior as a friend, and to be
   thus dependent upon, and wholly indebted and beholden to him for every
   thing; but it is not so, but directly the contrary, with the truly
   humble sinner: that friend will be most agreeable to such an one on
   whom he is most dependent, and to whom he is in the highest degree
   obliged; and we cannot form an idea of any other two friends so happy
   as these, when this is the case to the highest possible degree, or
   conceive of any friendship so great, advantageous and sweet as this. It
   seems indeed to belong to the nature of true creature friendship, even
   to desire and delight in this circumstance, viz. to be greatly indebted
   and beholden to the friend we esteem and love: the greater obligations
   we are under to him the better pleased we are, and the more sweet is
   the love and friendship. This seems to be owing to two things
   especially; one is, that hereby we have a clear and striking evidence
   of our friend's love to us; which must give sweetness and enjoyment in
   proportion to our love to him. The other is, that hereby we are led to
   feel and exercise a love of gratitude, which is peculiarly sweet, in
   proportion to the love of esteem, benevolence and complacency we have
   for our friend. In this view, the more we are obliged, the better; and
   the greater satisfaction and sweetness we have in the friendship. And
   on the other hand, the more the other has done for the obliged friend,
   and the greater benefactor he has been to him, the higher enjoyment and
   happiness he has, in proportion to his benevolence and love to him.

   Hence it is, that where persons have undertaken to represent the
   highest and most affecting instances of true love and friendship, and
   the greatest degree of enjoyment and happiness in such friendship, and
   exhibit this to the best advantage in a feigned story or romance, they
   have formed a history of some one of a high and excellent character,
   and of a generous, benevolent spirit, setting his heart on one in a
   mean, low and miserable state and circumstances, to be his spouse. She
   is, for instance, taken captive by her enemies, and reduced to the
   greatest poverty and distress, and her life eminently exposed. He, in
   order to redeem and deliver her, and procure her for his bride and
   spouse, goes through a long series of self-denial and sufferings; is at
   great expense, and does great exploits, and exposes his life to an
   eminent degree, without which she must have perished in the hands of
   her cruel foes. And thus he delivers her, by risking all that is dear
   to him in her behalf, and, in a sense, giving his own life for her; so
   that she entirely owes her life, and all she has, to him, and is under
   the greatest imaginable obligations to him. In this way he procures her
   for his spouse. and brings her into the nearest union to. himself, and
   a foundation is laid for the greatest happiness in each other, in the
   enjoyment of the most sweet love and friendship; every way to an
   unspeakably greater degree than could have been in different
   circumstances, or in any other way, in which she would not have been so
   much dependent upon, and so greatly obliged to him.

   This is but a faint shadow of the case before us, with respect to
   Christ, the friend and bridegroom of his church and people. They are
   fallen into an infinitely calamitous and evil Rate; a state of
   complete, total and eternal destruction; into the hands of the devil,
   their great and potent enemy, and under the displeasure and curse of
   the God that made them: being infinitely guilty and ill deserving, the
   prisoners of justice, bound over to suffer his eternal wrath; not being
   able or disposed to help and deliver themselves in the least degree.
   The Son of God was the only person in the universe that was able to
   redeem and save them; and he was not under the lead obligation to do
   it. But he voluntarily offered himself, and undertook this most
   difficult, costly and mighty work; and that from pure love and
   benevolence to these lost and infinitely miserable creatures, and a
   desire to procure and present to himself a glorious church, a bride,
   not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but perfectly beautiful
   and holy, and without blemish, being brought into the nearest and
   everlasting union and friendship with himself.

   In order to this, he gave himself for them. Though he was a person of
   infinite dignity, riches and worth, he became poor, and humbled himself
   so as to become a servant, and subjected himself to the greatest
   ignominy and sufferings, even unto death. He voluntarily put himself
   into the place and circumstances of his spouse, and when her whole
   interest lay at stake, and she was in a state of complete destruction,
   he took the whole of her destruction and sufferings on himself, and
   went through with the matter: he drank the whole of the bitter cup,
   that she might escape; he gave his life for her ransom, and spilt his
   own blood in the most trying circumstances, that he might completely
   redeem her from the jaws of the most dreadful and eternal destruction,
   and deliver her from the hand and power of all her enemies. He has
   survived the dreadful scene, having completed the greatest and most
   difficult work that ever was, or ever will or can be undertaken, and
   yet lives to espouse the cause of his people; and will not stop till he
   has completed the matter, and sanctified and cleansed every one of them
   with the washing of water by the word, and brought them into the most
   near, and an everlasting union and friendship with himself, in the most
   perfect enjoyment of his love, riches, honours and happiness forever
   and ever.

   Thus the redeemed have a Friend, not only in himself most excellent and
   worthy, and full of the greatest benevolence and goodness, but one on
   whom they are in the highest degree dependent, and to whom they are
   indebted and obliged in the highest imaginable or even possible degree,
   in a manner which is most pleasing to them, and serves to render him
   unspeakably more excellent and worthy in their eyes, and give a
   sweetness to their love and friendship, which could not be known, in
   any other circumstances.

   No other creatures in the universe have such a friend as this. The
   angels have no such friend. When some of them fell into sin and wo,
   they had no friend to redeem them. And the redeemed from among men have
   had infinitely more done for them, and they are infinitely more
   dependent on the Son of God for all good and happiness, and indebted
   and obliged to him, than the angels are. They are the bride, the Lamb's
   wife, who are by him redeemed out of great tribulation, from a state of
   infinite wo, in which they lay perfectly helpless; that he might enjoy
   them forever in a peculiar union and friendship, which exceeds every
   thing of this kind in all possible degrees. These circumstances lay a
   foundation for a sweetness and enjoyment immensely higher than could
   take place in any other way. In a sense and acknowledgment of what
   Christ has done for them, and their peculiar dependence upon, and
   obligations to him, the redeemed will exercise a kind of humble, sweet
   and beautiful love towards their Friend and Redeemer, which is peculiar
   to them, and never could have had an existence in any other way but
   this; and which will be the eternal source of a most sweet and high
   enjoyment, which no stranger, none but the beloved bride, not even the
   angels, can intermeddle with or taste. In the exercise of this
   peculiarly sweet love and friendship towards their infinitely dear and
   glorious Friend and Redeemer, they will eternally sing a new song,
   which none but the redeemed, the bride, the Lamb's wife, can possibly
   sing or learn, to all eternity; no, not even the highest and bed angel
   in heaven; saying, "Worthy is the Lamb to receive power, and riches,
   and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory; for thou wast slain,
   and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, and hast made us kings and
   priests unto God." Well then may they now begin to say, with a
   heart-felt sweetness, and joy which is unspeakable and full of glory,
   "This is my beloved, and this is my friend."

   4. Jesus Christ is a friend who has exercised the highest degrees of
   love, and has given the greatest possible testimonies of it.

   In order to true friendship there must be mutual love. This is
   essential to the character of our friend, that he loves us; and he acts
   in this character, and maintains friendship, by exercising love, and
   giving proper tokens and manifestations of it, on all occasions.
   Solomon observes, that "A friend loveth at all times." And he is the
   greatest friend, whose love is the strongest, and is exercised and
   manifested in the most difficult and trying circumstances.

   Now Christ has distinguished himself from all others in this respect,
   and has discovered himself to be infinitely the greatest and best
   friend. This appears from what was said, under the last particular, of
   what Christ has done and suffered for his spouse; for in all this he
   exercised and expressed his love, and that in the most trying
   circumstances, and to the highest possible degree. One thing that
   recommends a friend, and adds to his worth and excellence, and makes
   him dear to his beloved, is, that he is a tried friend; he has
   persevered in his friendship, and exercised and expressed his love in
   the most difficult case imaginable i in doing which he has been at the
   greatest pains and cost, while he had the created temptations to give
   up his beloved. Jesus Christ is such a tried friend, and that to the
   greatest possible degree.

   "Greater love hath no man," says this greatest and chief of all
   friends, "than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." But
   Christ's love and friendship has infinitely exceeded this. He has done
   and suffered more for his people than merely dying for them, a thousand
   times over. He drank the bitter cup for them, which was infinitely more
   than merely dying a violent death. He was made a curse for them, and
   suffered a sense of the wrath of God. This drank up his spirits: the
   foretaste of it threw him into the most amazing agony: and this made
   him cry out, in inexpressible and most astonishing anguish, "My God, my
   God, why hast thou forsaken me!" What is the most cruel death that ever
   martyr suffered, to this? The martyrs have been able to rejoice in the
   midst of all the keenest tortures enemies could inflict. They have sung
   in the flames, and found it the most happy, joyful hour they ever saw.
   And so might Christ have done on the cross, had he but their supports,
   and no more to suffer than they. But what he suffered in his death was
   something infinitely greater and more terrible. Under this infinite
   weight he hung on the cross, and at last bowed his head and gave up the
   ghost. This was dying in a sense and degree in which no other person
   ever did. To die thus was infinitely more, and greater, and more
   dreadful, than the death of all the ten thousand martyrs who have
   fallen a sacrifice to the cruelty of their bloody persecutors. Yea, it
   was as great a thing and equivalent to the eternal death and
   destruction which the redeemed deserve, and were exposed to: for he
   died in their stead; he took their death and eternal destruction on
   himself. On him it fell in its full weight, and he bore and went
   through it all. He knew what it would cost him to espouse the cause of
   sinners; yet he voluntarily undertook, put himself in their
   circumstances (sin only excepted) and went through with it, without
   flinching in the least degree. Here is an instance of love and
   friendship, to which there neither is, nor can be, any parallel in the
   universe. This is the evidence and token of love which Christ has given
   to his people; which is infinitely the greatest that ever was, or can
   be.

   Besides, the love of Christ to his people will appear yet greater, if
   we consider their native character and disposition towards him. He
   loved them, and died for them, when they were not only mean, worthless,
   unworthy and infinitely guilty, but his enemies, disposed to hate,
   despise and oppose him, in his whole character and in all his ways; and
   even in his most astonishing works of love and kindness to them. Herein
   he has commended his love to us, in that, when we were his great and
   inexcusable enemies, he died for us. It is a much higher exercise of
   love, and a greater testimony of it, to love and die for an enemy, a
   base, odious injurious creature, than it would be to do this for an
   excellent, benevolent and much esteemed friend.

   What higher evidence and testimony could Christ give of his love of
   benevolence, to those whom he redeems, than this! And what higher act
   of love and friendship can there be! Surely his love to his people
   cannot be doubted of. And if he thus loved them when they were, his
   vile enemies, he will continue to love them now they are reconciled,
   and have chosen him for their best friend and patron. And this is an
   exercise and evidence of a strong and wonderful love, that will
   unspeakably endear him to them, and add an inexpressible sweetness to
   this friendship forever.

   And, as the effect and further, evidence of this love, see gives them
   his Holy Spirit to change their hearts, deliver them from the dominion
   of sin, and the slavery to Satan, in which they naturally are, and
   implant lasting principles of holiness and love to him, by which their
   hearts are purified, and unite themselves to him, with the most perfect
   bond and union of love and friendship. This is another pledge of his
   great, everlasting and unchangeable love to them. And the saints in
   this world, so far as they have the evidence that they are the subjects
   of such a work of grace, may well rejoice, and with unspeakably sweet
   delight give praise "unto him that has loved them, and washed them from
   their sins in his own blood." What wonderful, sovereign love and grace
   Is this, which overtakes and falls upon the guilty, sinful wretch,
   while in his full career to hell, running on in the most daring, mad
   opposition to Christ, and contempt of him, without the least
   disposition to hearken to the voice of wisdom, and turn at his reproof!
   Every true Christian ascribes all this to Christ, and is so affected
   with his preventing, sovereign love and grace, herein exercised and
   manifested, as to taste an unspeakable sweetness in it. With what sweet
   delight does he often say, "If I have the least degree of love to
   Christ, and a heart to know, submit to and trust in him, this is the
   effect of his eternal preventing, sovereign love and grace, which alone
   has made the difference between me and those who run on in their mad
   course to hell! Not unto me, not unto me, but to thy wonderful,
   distinguishing love and grace, be all the glory!"

   It may be also observed here, that Christ has given, them his Spirit,
   by which they are sealed to the day or redemption, and as the pledge
   and earnest of their eternal inheritance, so a pledge and token of his
   unchangeable, everlasting love to them. He has indeed given himself,
   and all things, to them; he has made them heirs of the whole universe.
   He has made and is doing all things for their sakes. He says to his
   church or redeemed ones, "I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of
   Israel, thy Saviour; I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for
   thee. Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable,
   and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people
   for thy life." (Isa. xliii. 3, 4.) Surely Christ shews the greatest
   love imaginable to his people, since he gives them all he has to give,
   and withholds no one good thing from them. Now the more love he has to
   his people, and the higher and more clear evidence he gives of it, so
   much the more excellent and valuable friend he is to them; and their
   happiness in him as a friend will be in proportion to this. How
   infinitely distinguished, in this respect, is Christ from all other
   friends! Well may the Christian say, "This is my beloved, and this is
   my friend.

Sermon IV.

   The same Subject continued.

   Cant. v. 16. This is my beloved, and this is my friend.

   5. JESUS CHRIST, the Christian's friend, is a person of infinite
   dignity, worth and excellence. He has all this to the highest possible
   perfection and extent, so that no imagination can possibly exceed it.
   This his true dignity, worth and excellence, in himself considered,
   infinitely heightens his character and worth as a friend, and lays a
   foundation for the most sweet, exalted and growing happiness in his
   love and friendship to all eternity. He who has no true worth and
   excellence cannot be justly valued and delighted in at all, as a
   friend, and there is no foundation for a happy friendship with such an
   one. Worth and excellence therefore comes into the essence of the
   character of a friend: and the more any one has of this, the more is he
   to be prized as a friend, and the greater happiness is to be enjoyed in
   his love and friendship. A friend gives himself to his beloved; so that
   the more dignity, worth and excellence he has, the more he gives to the
   person he admits into union and friendship with him. Therefore the more
   worth and excellence any person has, the more we naturally, and justly,
   prize his love and friendship, and the more sweetness and pleasure we
   have in it. We prize and delight in the love of another in proportion
   to. our esteem of him, and the sense we have of his true excellence,
   dignity and worthiness. How much better is it to us to be the objects
   of the love of some dignified personage, who appears to us to have all
   the excellence and attracting charms of human nature, and to have him
   our friend, than to have the love and friendship of one who is in our
   eyes absolutely worthless and contemptible! I need not therefore, yea,
   I cannot, say of how much advantage the dignity and excellence of
   Christ is in this friendship, in this view. The higher the Christian
   rises in his esteem of Christ, the more he sees of his dignity and
   excellence, the more pleased and delighted he will necessarily be in
   being the object of his embraces and love. Surely then he had rather in
   this view be beloved by Christ than by all the world besides; and
   nothing can fill his breast with such overflowing delight as to be able
   to say. This is my beloved, and this is my friend. And this lays a
   foundation for esteem and complacency, without which there can be no
   happy friendship; and the higher this rises, the more happiness and
   enjoyment there is in a friend. Christ in this respect is distinguished
   from all other persons in the universe, as the best friend, in union
   and love to whom there may be the highest happiness. We are in
   ourselves so mean and low, and of such little worth, that we cannot
   enjoy friendship to the best advantage with those who are our equals.
   The more dignified and excellent our friend is, and the more
   distinguished he is from us, and the more above us, in this respect,
   the more happy shall we necessarily be in his love and friendship. In
   Christ therefore believers have all that can be desired in a friend, in
   this respect. In him they have an inexhaustible fund for high and
   growing enjoyment; and, in a sense of his dignity and excellence, their
   ravished hearts will swell with, extatic delight, while they feel and
   say, "This is my beloved, and this is my friend."

   6. Jesus Christ is the most condescending, familiar friend.

   Where there is a great imparity in two friends, the one very high,
   honourable and worthy, and the other mean and low, it is inconsistent
   with the most sweet and happy friendship, unless he who is dignified
   and exalted, and is every way so much superior to the other, knows how,
   and is disposed, to exercise condescension equal to his true dignity
   and worth, so as to practise as great familiarity and intimacy with his
   friend who is so much beneath him, as if he were his equal. But where
   this is the case, the great superiority of one to the other gives a
   great advantage to the friendship, and renders it more sweet and happy
   to the inferior; so that the more worthy and exalted his friend is, the
   higher enjoyment he has in the friendship. This imparity in station and
   dignity is commonly in the way of the enjoyment of true friendship
   among men in this world; because the great and exalted know not how to
   condescend and stoop to the mean and low, in a manner and degree that
   is in such a case necessary, but are disposed to keep themselves at a
   distance.

   But Christ is in this respect the most excellent friend; for his
   condescension and humility are equal to his high exaltation and
   dignity, and he admits his friends, however mean, unworthy and
   despicable they are in themselves, to as great familiarity and
   intimacy, as if he were but their equal; so that his superiority and
   dignity give great advantage to the friendship, in this respect.

   And here it is of importance to observe, that his incarnation, or union
   to the human nature, by which he is a real man, even Immanuel, God with
   us, is of infinite advantage with respect to this. God is infinitely
   the best friend; but it is impossible he should communicate himself to
   creatures, and become their condescending, familiar friend, in any
   other way, so well, and to so great advantage, as by uniting himself to
   their nature, so as to become one of them. In this view, as well as on
   many other accounts, the incarnation of the Son of God is a most wise
   and gracious contrivance, as it is adapted in the highest possible
   degree to promote the happiness of creatures, especially of the
   redeemed, in the love and enjoyment of God. God hereby comes down to
   creatures in a way and manner suited to their nature and capacity, and
   discovers and communicates himself to them to the greatest possible
   advantage; and there is a foundation laid for that condescension to
   men, and intimate love and friendly familiarity between Christ and his
   people, which could not have been in any other way. The Most High God
   is become a man, a most meek, humble, condescending man, able and
   disposed to take his people into the most intimate union and
   familiarity; while this man has all the dignity and honour of divinity.
   Thus the man Christ Jesus will eternally be the medium of a kind and
   degree of communication of the Deity to creatures, which could be in no
   other way, and which is every way adapted to raise them up and make
   them happy: and the redeemed have a most condescending, intimate friend
   in the person of Christ, who is both God and man, who cannot be
   equalled by any other person in the universe; and in union and
   friendship with whom, they have the highest enjoyment and happiness.

   The condescension of Christ, as a most tender, intimate and familiar
   friend, is truly wonderful, and has not, nor ever will have, any
   parallel in the universe. This he practised in a manner and degree
   truly astonishing, towards his friends and disciples, when he was on
   earth. He condescended to their weakness, and adapted himself in his
   instructions to their low, childish way of conceiving of things, and
   meekly bore with their stupidity and unteachable perverseness. He dwelt
   with them night and day, and admitted them to embrace and kiss him from
   time to time. We may look on this as an image and specimen of the
   condescension and familiarity w4th which he treats his people at all
   times. Though he is now exalted in the highest heavens, and has taken
   the throne of the universe, and rules over all, angels and authorities
   and powers being made subject: unto him; yet this has not lifted him up
   in any degree, so as to dispose him to keep at a greater distance from
   his people; but he practises as much condescension towards the meanest
   of them, and receives them to as great a nearness and familiarity, as
   ever he did in his state of humiliation. His condescension and goodness
   in this respect infinitely exceeds that of any other friend, and is
   equal to his exaltation, greatness and dignity. In this he excels all
   other friends, as much as he does in honour and dignity.

   No other friend is so easy of access as he: his friends are Welcome to
   him at all times; yea, he is always present with them, so that they may
   converse with him whenever they please, in the most intimate, familiar
   manner, without keeping the least distance, and without any reserve. He
   is all attention to them whenever they turn their thoughts with their
   hearts towards him, and no thing can divert him from conversing with
   them, or interrupt the correspondence, but their withdrawing
   themselves, or turning away from him. He is ready to meet them and
   attend upon them at what time and place they please; yea, he calls
   after them, and invites them to look towards him, and speak to him. He
   says to each one of his friends, "Let me see thy countenance, let me
   hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely."
   Behold, he stands at the door of every one, and knocks, and whoever
   opens to him, he comes in and sups with them, and they with him.

   And here it is worthy of special remark, that their meanness,
   unworthiness, and past ill treatment of him, is not in the least in the
   way of this his condescending goodness and kindness. He has no
   disposition to retaliate for their folly and ingratitude, and keep them
   at a distance for this: he is as condescending and kind to the meanest
   and most unworthy and guilty, as to any whatsoever. And while he thus
   condescends, and is good and kind to them in the most liberal manner,
   he does not upbraid them for their past follies, or because they, are
   so much beholden to him. He gives most bountifully, and with the
   greatest liberality, and upbraideth not.

   And he is not, nor ever will be, ashamed of any of his people who have
   united themselves to him as their chosen friend, however mean and
   despicable in themselves; but he will appear as their friend, at all
   times, and in the most public manner, and own them to be his friends,
   and confess their names before his Father, and before his angels. Yea,
   he is so far from being ashamed of them, that he looks on them as an
   honour to him. They are unto him "a crown of glory, and a royal
   diadem," in the hand of this their condescending friend: they are unto
   him "for a name and for a praise and for a glory," as the bride is the
   ornament and glory of her husband. Such a friend as this has every true
   Christian, in which he is infinitely distinguished from all other
   friends; who is most exactly suited to the circumstances of the
   redeemed from among men, and to raise their happiness in friendship
   with him to the highest key.--But I have yet many other things to say
   of this most excellent and blessed Friend.

   7. By all his condescension, love and kindness towards sinners, and
   entering into the nearest and dearest friendship with them, he does not
   degrade himself in the least, nor lose any degree of his true dignity,
   worth and excellence; but has greatly honoured himself hereby.

   This is a very important and essential article in this friendship; for
   if this were not true, it would be a very unhappy union, and no good
   could come of it, either to Christ, or those on whom he sets his love.
   If this were a dishonourable friendship on Christ's part, he would by
   this lose his merit and worthiness in the sight of the Father; so could
   be of no avail to recommend the sinner on whom he sets his love, of
   which he stands in infinite need, and without which he cannot be happy
   in the favour of God; which will be more particularly considered under
   the next head.

   The Jews attempted to reproach our Lord, and cast an odium upon him, by
   saying that he was a friend of publicans and sinners. If he had been so
   in the sense they meant, it would have been indeed a reproach and
   disgrace to him. If he had been their friend in a sense which did imply
   the least degree of love and approbation of their character as sinners,
   and if he had espoused their cause in this view, and under the least
   influence of this, he would so far degrade himself, and render himself
   and his love worthless, odious and despicable in the sight of all holy,
   worthy beings. This therefore would have wholly spoilt his character as
   the Almighty Friend and Redeemer of sinners. But Jesus Christ is
   infinitely far from this. Though he is the friend of sinners, has
   espoused their cause, and befriended them as no other person ever did
   or could; yet he has not hereby appeared in the least degree a friend
   to sin, but the contrary to an infinite degree. lie has befriended
   sinners, consistent with the most perfect and even infinite hatred of
   sin, and so of their character as sinners, and so as to manifest his
   hatred and abhorrence of them to the highest possible degree. In his
   highest act of love and friendship to sinners, he did in the highest
   possible degree, and in the most public, convincing, striking manner,
   justify the Divine Character and law which the sinner had opposed and
   contemned, and condemn the sinner. The highest angel in heaven cannot
   conceive to this day, and never will to all eternity, how Christ could
   have condemned sin more effectually, and set the sinner in a worse and
   more odious light, and shewed his love of holiness and hatred of sin
   more fully, than he did when he died on the cross. In this he did in
   the highest possible degree justify God in threatening and cursing the
   sinner, and being disposed to punish him forever, while he voluntarily
   took that punishment on himself, that the sinner might escape.

   In Christ then are united the greatest friend to God and his law, and
   to the cause and interest of holiness, that ever was known in the
   universe; and at the same time the greatest friend of the sinner. These
   two seeming contraries are united in the same person and character, and
   expressed in the most perfect manner, and to the highest degree, in the
   same conduct. Therefore, when Christ stooped the lowest, and
   condescended the most to befriend sinners, he did in the highest degree
   and most effectual manner espouse the cause of God in opposition to the
   sinner, and appeared in his greatest excellency, and was most worthy
   and meritorious, in God's light. How these two could be united in the
   same person and the same act, was far above the wisdom of angels; and
   herein, in a special manner, is Christ the wisdom of God.

   Well may the Christian boast and say, "This is my friend;" who is also
   the greatest friend to the supreme Lawgiver of the universe, and has so
   become my friend, and stooped to espouse my cause, and take me into the
   nearest and dearest relation to himself, as at the same time to
   maintain and express his dignity, worthiness and excellency, and merit
   infinitely in the sight of the Father.--This leads to another
   particular.

   8. Christ improves all his worth and excellence in the behalf and for
   the benefit of his people. It is all theirs, and improved to their
   advantage, in the best manner, and to the highest degree; so that it is
   in effect all given away to them, being most effectually, and to the
   best purpose, placed to their account.

   Sinners want such a friend; and no other person could befriend them to
   any purpose, to himself or to them, but one who is infinitely excellent
   and worthy. They being infinitely hateful, guilty and ill-deserving in
   themselves, and having nothing by which they can abate their
   ill-desert, and render themselves a whit the more deserving and
   acceptable, on its own account, they must be eternally hated and
   cursed, unless they have something to recommend them which is not in
   themselves, but in some other: and this must be something infinitely
   valuable and excellent, or it cm in no measure or degree countervail
   their odiousness and ill-desert so as in the least to recommend them to
   their offended Lawgiver and Sovereign. And it will not become him to
   forgive them and show them any favour, unless they have something to
   recommend them, and repair the dishonour they have done him by
   violating his law, and despising his character and government.
   Therefore, unless some one did espouse their cause and undertake for
   them, who has worthiness and merit enough to restore the honour of
   God's broken law, and effectually recommend sinners to their offended
   Sovereign by interposing his own worthiness in their behalf, they must
   be the objects of his displeasure and wrath forever, as what is most
   fit and right.

   Now Christ is the only person in the universe who was able effectually
   to espouse their cause in this respect, and act the part of a friend to
   them. He has worthiness and merit enough in the eyes of the offended
   Deity, effectually to procure pardon and favour for the sinner, if
   properly interposed in his behalf, so that it might be fit to reckon it
   to his account. And this Christ has done in the most lit and proper
   manner. He has put: himself in the sinner's stead, has borne the curse
   he lay under, and paid the greatest honours to the divine law and
   character; which is so pleasing and acceptable to the Majesty of
   Heaven, that he is ready to pardon and. bless any one who is a friend
   to Christ, and trusts in his merit and worthiness alone to recommend
   him.

   Christ repeatedly spoke of this to his disciples in the most express
   manner, and told them that their love and union of heart to him did
   effectually recommend them to the Father, and interest them in his love
   and favour, to as great a degree as they needed, or could desire. His
   words are, "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is
   that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father. If
   any man love me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him.
   For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have
   believed that I came out from God."

   We cannot reasonably suppose that Christ means to declare in these
   words that their love and friendship to him did, on its own account, or
   because of the excellency and worth of it in itself considered,
   recommend them to the Father, and procure his love and favour to them,
   as a testimony of his well-pleasedness with their persons and love,
   considered as by themselves, and separate from Christ. We cannot
   understand our Saviour thus in these words; for this would set them in
   direct contradiction to the whole New Testament, which teaches us that
   sinners are pardoned, and received to the favour and love of the
   Father, purely out of respect to Christ, to his righteousness and
   worthiness, which alone recommends them to him; and not any exercises
   and works of their own. But his meaning must be, that the Father is so
   well pleased with him, and loves him so well, considered in the
   capacity of mediator and a friend of sinners, and his merit and
   worthiness in this character is so great in his light, that he is ready
   to be well pleased with and love any sinner who unites himself to him
   in true love and friendship, and trusts in him in this relation and
   character. Such love and union to this friend is a sufficient ground
   and reason of the Father's loving him; and so the Father loves him,
   because he loves and is united to his Son, who is infinitely honourable
   and worthy in his light, and is infinitely near and dear to him: and
   who has done and suffered so much in the behalf of the sinner, that his
   merit and worth might be improved for his benefit, in which he has
   honoured the Father, and in the most excellent way and manner possible,
   and to the greatest advantage, employed all the interest he has with
   the Father, to procure his love and favour to the sinner who is thus
   united to him. The Father loves his Son so well, he is a person of such
   infinite dignity and worthiness, and has exercised such an high degree
   of virtue, and has honoured him so much, in what he has done and
   suffered for sinners, improving all his merit with the Father in their
   behalf; that nothing is wanting but the sinner's loving him and
   trusting in him in this character, so uniting himself to him as his
   true friend, in order to the Father's loving him. The Father has such
   love to his Son, and the Son stands in such a relation to sinners, that
   the sinner who loves the Son is necessarily beloved by the Father,
   purely from the love he has to his Son, however odious, vile and
   unworthy he is in himself. And thus the Father loves them, because they
   love his Son; and can do no otherwise, unless he ceases to love his
   Son; for the love he has to his Son will necessarily operate so, and
   induce him to love those who love his Son, and to whom the Son is a
   friend, and acts as their friend before the Father, presenting his
   merit, and all he has done and suffered for his honour, desiring that
   this may be reckoned to them, and that they might have pardon and
   favour on his account. For the Father to withhold his love and favour
   from such is really to withhold his love and favour from his Son; and
   therefore if he love the latter, he will love the former; and there is
   no other possible supposition in the reason and nature of things.

   And this view of the matter (by the way) may lead all the attentive to
   see what is the true meaning and import of the do6lrine of the
   imputation of the merit and righteousness of Christ, for the pardon and
   justification of the sinner, who believes in and cleaves to him in the
   character of a mediator; and how reasonable it is, and exactly
   agreeable to the nature of things.

   If we have a friend who loves us, and there is a mutual friendship
   between us and him, who we know has great favour and merit with one
   whom we have offended, and whose love and favour we want, and who is
   very dear to him, and greatly beloved by him; we are naturally, and
   with the greatest reason, ready to trust in such a. friend to procure
   for us the favour we want. And if the dignity and worthiness of our
   friend is sufficient, and his merit with the person we have offended is
   so great as to countervail our offence, and worthy of so great a favour
   as we want, and we know he is engaged to make the best use of his merit
   and worthiness in the eyes of that person to procure of him this
   favour, having exerted himself in all possible ways in our behalf, and
   so as greatly to please and honour him; if we have such a friend, we
   may be sure of obtaining the favour we want, however unworthy we are,
   and how much soever we have offended this person, and though he has no
   disposition to shew us the least favour on our own account; but,
   considered as we are in ourselves, and unconnected with our friend, is
   disposed to hate, condemn and destroy us: and in proportion to our love
   to our friend, and sense of his dignity and worthiness, and of the high
   virtue and excellence of what he had done in our behalf, shall we have
   confidence of obtaining the favour we want, and with boldness approach
   the offended person in his name.

   If a subject has incurred the just displeasure of his prince, and
   greatly wants his pardon and favour; how happy does he count himself,
   if he has some great personage his friend, who is near the prince, and
   has great honour and favour with him! especially if he knows this great
   and honourable personage is ready to improve all the interest and
   influence he has with the prince, in his behalf, and for this end has
   been at vail pains and expense to make good the damage the prince had
   sustained by his crime, and render it honourable for him to grant the
   pardon, and bestow the favour he wants. In such a case we all know the
   criminal cannot fail of obtaining the pardon and favour he needs, if
   his friend at court has dignity, merit and worthiness enough, in the
   eyes of the prince, to be worthy of such a favour. The prince's love to
   this personage will naturally, and necessarily, flow out to the person
   whose friend he is, and who loves him. And in this case we see the
   merit and worthiness of this great and excellent personage is imputed,
   or transferred to the account of the unworthy criminal, to recommend
   him to that favour, and procure it for him, of which he is most
   unworthy in himself, and which it would have been utterly unfit and
   indecent for the prince to bellow upon him, had it not been for this
   his connection with this worthy person.

   This is in some degree a parallel to the case before us. Jesus Christ,
   the Christian's friend, appears with such dignity and honour in the
   court of heaven, and has done such astonishingly great and wonderful
   exploits to secure the honour of the Almighty Sovereign and Lawgiver of
   Heaven and Earth, and render it consistent with his granting pardon and
   favour to sinners; and has so pleased and honoured the Father, and is
   so dear and excellent in his eyes, that he is ready to love and shew
   favour to any sinner who loves this worthy personage, and is a real and
   hearty friend to him; whose interest he espouses before the Father, and
   interposes all his merit in his behalf. This is quite sufficient to
   recommend the most guilty, ill-deserving wretch on earth to all the
   favour that Heaven can bellow. He has no need to plead any thing but
   his relation and union to the Son of God, as his true and hearty
   friend; he wants nothing else to recommend him to the highest honours
   and happiness in God's kingdom forever. The Father of the Universe will
   love him with a dear and everlasting love, and embrace him as his dear
   child, the friend of his well-beloved, his dearest Son. And all the
   angels will love, serve and honour him forever, because he bears the
   character, and stands in the relation, of a friend to the Son of God,
   and is one whose interest he has espoused, and whose name he will
   confess before the Father and before the angels.

   Thus the Christian has a friend who is not only most worthy and
   excellent in his eyes, with whom his heart is pleased and charmed; but
   this excellence and worthiness is reckoned to his account, and is
   become his righteousness, by which he is recommended to pardon and
   favour with God; so that the Supreme Majesty and Lawgiver of Heaven and
   Earth hereby becomes his eternal friend and father. Therefore the
   higher sense the Christian has of Christ's excellency and worthiness,
   and the more he loves him, the more confidence, assurance and joy will
   he naturally have in his merit and righteousness, and say, "In the Lord
   Jesus Christ have I righteousness: In him shall I, with all the seed of
   Israel, be justified, and in him only will I glory."

   9. Christ is not only a friend who is full of good will and benevolence
   to his people, but he highly esteems them, and has great and most sweet
   complacency and delight in them.

   This is abundantly represented in this song. Christ often calls his
   spouse, the church, his fair one: and she is to him the fairest among
   women. His language to his church, and to every true member of it, is,
   "O my dove, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for
   sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely." "Behold, thou art
   fair, my love; behold, thou art fair: thou hast doves' eyes within thy
   locks. Thou art all fair, my love, there is no spot in thee. Thou hast
   ravished my heart, my lifter, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart
   with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. How much better is
   thy love than wine 1 and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
   How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! Since thou
   wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved
   thee."

   There is something mysterious and wonderful in this; that Christ should
   thus esteem and delight in those who are in themselves, and in their
   natural state, so mean, despicable, vile and odious. But this comes to
   pass by his putting his own beauty and excellence upon them, forming
   them after his own likeness, and receiving them into the nearest
   relation to himself, by which they become clothed with his
   righteousness and worthiness, and partake of his honour and fulness: so
   that in this near relation, and beautified and adorned with his own
   beauty and holiness, they are honourable in his eyes, and he takes
   great complacency and delight in them. And as he is continually
   purifying and adorning them more and more, and will go on to do it
   until not the least deformity, not so much as spot or wrinkle, remains,
   and they are become most perfect beauties, so his complacency and
   delight in them is increasing, and is now greater, in the view of what
   they shall soon be brought to, even the most consummate beauty and
   glory, like a king's daughter, all glorious within, and her clothing of
   wrought gold: and they shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of
   their Father, the most beautiful, glorious bride of the Lamb.

   Now this adds an unspeakable value and sweetness to this friendship. In
   proportion as any one esteems, loves and delights in another, he
   naturally, and even necessarily, desires to be the object of his esteem
   and complacency; and consequently this gives him a sweet enjoyment and
   happiness, so far as he has evidence that it takes place, and in a
   degree equal to his view and sense of the worthiness and excellency of
   his friend. How great then must be the happiness of the believer in his
   friendship with Christ, from this circumstance! He has the highest and
   growing esteem of his person and character, and is more and more
   ravished with his superlative beauty and excellence; and nothing can be
   more desirable and sweet to him than to have the approbation and love
   of this glorious, excellent personage: and nothing is wanting to
   complete his happiness, but to know that he is the object of the
   complacency and sweet delight of his best beloved and most. esteemed
   friend. The thought of this is most transporting to his soul; and the
   more he is persuaded and assured of this in this world, the more
   ineffable sweetness does he taste and enjoy in this friendship. What
   then will be the happiness of this exalted friendship, when the beloved
   faint shall be made to shine forth as the sun in the most perfect
   beauty, and shall behold the dignity, beauty and excellence of his
   glorious Friend and Redeemer in the meridian brightness and splendour
   of his glory, and his heart shall glow with the highest and most
   perfect love of esteem and complacency towards him, while this his
   infinitely glorious and excellent Friend returns love for love in the
   most full and ample manner, and embraces him as his dearest and best
   beloved, giving him the greatest possible assurance that he takes
   unspeakable delight and satisfaction in him, and will do lo to all
   eternity! This will raise the redeemed to heights of happiness, and
   sweet, extatic delight, beyond all conception, in the enjoyment of
   their exalted, most dear and best beloved friend, while they find
   themselves embraced by him in the high exercises of sweet love and
   complacence, being perfectly pleased and ravished with their love, and,
   in the highest and most exalted sense, "his left hand is under their
   head, and his right hand doth embrace them." How will their hearts
   swell with the thought, and be filled full, and even run over, with
   ineffable delight and joy, while they think, and with the greatest
   assurance say, "This is my beloved, and this is my friend!"

   And it is worthy of observation here, that their dependence on Christ
   for all their worthiness, beauty and excellence, as they receive it all
   from him, by which they become the objects of his esteem and
   complacency, they being wholly without any thing of this kind, and
   infinitely to the contrary of it as he finds them; this their
   dependence on him will greatly add to the sweetness and enjoyment,
   while they find themselves thus esteemed and beloved by him; for it is
   unspeakably more desirable and sweet to become the objects of his love
   and complacency in this way, than in any other.

   The spouse who venerates, esteems and loves her husband far above all
   others, is happy in his embraces, and the tokens of his esteem,
   complacency and delight in her, in proportion to her sense of his
   dignity, worthiness and excellence. And if she has received all that
   which recommends her to him as the object of his peculiar esteem and
   delight, from him, or some way by his means, this will greatly add to
   the sweetness of her enjoyment, in a sense of his great condescension
   and goodness, and her peculiar obligations to him. This is a faint
   emblem of the case before us; for these things take place in the
   friendship we are considering, to an immensely greater degree, and in a
   far more exalted manner, than can be in any thing temporal and earthly.

   And, by the way, it may be here observed, that the redeemed will have
   greatly the advantage of an eels in their friendship with Christ in
   this particular. As Christ has been a greater friend to the redeemed
   than to angels; has exercised immensely more benevolence and kindness,
   and done infinitely more for them, and so laid them under infinitely
   greater obligations to esteem, love and honour him; so he exercises a
   greater love of esteem, complacency and delight towards them, than the
   angels are the objects of: and that because, he puts a peculiar and
   distinguishing beauty and dignity on them, of which the angels do not
   partake. As the King's bride, the queen, however mean her state was
   before she married him, is more honourable, and is much more the object
   of his esteem and complacency, and he takes much more delight and
   satisfaction in her, than in any of the most dignified servants and
   greatest nobles of his court, however great and honourable they are in
   themselves, and she enjoys a peculiar sweetness in his love, and a much
   higher pleasure and happiness than any of them can do; so the bride,
   the Lamb's wife, is more happy in the embraces and peculiar love of her
   glorious Friend and Husband, the King of the Universe, and tastes more
   sweetness in a sense of his distinguished affection to her, than the
   angels, those noble servants of the King of Heaven, ever will or can
   do. Christ will eternally exercise and manifest a peculiar complacency
   and delight in them as their distinguished friend and redeemer: and
   this will be the source of a peculiar enjoyment and happiness, m which
   they will be distinguished from all other creatures, in the love and
   embraces of such a friend as no others ever had, or ever will have.

   10. Christ is as much the friend of every individual, and the
   friendship between him and each one is as great, sweet and happy, and
   every way to as great advantage, as if he was the friend of no other
   person; yea, much more so.

   Herein this friendship differs from, and has the advantage of, all
   others. If the love and affection of other friends is divided among a
   great number, and they have one common friend in whose friendship they
   share, each one has a less share than if he was the only beloved: and
   if we have one friend whom we esteem and love much above all others, it
   seems most agreeable at lead to have a peculiar and distinguished share
   in his affection, and to have him a friend to us in a sense and degree
   in which he is not to any other; so that a partner or rival in his
   affections and friendship is rather undesirable than pleasing, and
   tends to give an alloy to the friendship, rather than a sweetness. This
   is in a peculiar manner so in love and friendship between the sexes.
   The bride or spouse is jealous of any rival in the affection of her
   husband; she is contented with nothing short of having the whole of his
   love and affection centring in her: she naturally monopolizes it to
   herself exclusively, and cannot bear to have any one share with her in
   this friendship; and if this should be the case, it will spoil the
   friendship for her, and the more she loves him, the more unhappy and
   miserable she is.

   And this, by the way, is a very strong and striking evidence, among
   many others, that this song, in which the text is found, is not a
   common love-song; as in this respect it is formed on a plan contrary to
   the nature of common love and friendship between the sexes, or the
   bride and her lover, and which is only suited to the case before us.
   The beloved spouse is in this song represented not as a single person,
   but as a company or society of persons united in seeking and setting
   their affections on one person as their common friend and lover. The
   spouse seeks company in her love to the bridegroom, and endeavours to
   draw other women to join with her in loving him, and speaks of others
   being united with her, in this, with approbation and pleasure:
   "Therefore the virgins love thee:--Draw me, we will run after thee:--WE
   will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than
   wine; the upright love thee." "Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou
   fairest among women? whither is thy beloved gone aside? that we may
   seek him with thee. My beloved is gone down into his garden, &c.--Thou
   that dwelleth in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice."
   This is a very unnatural representation for a woman to make with
   relation to her beloved friend, with whom she is seeking a union and
   friendship, in which a companion or rival would be most disagreeable.
   But it is perfectly agreeable to the case before us; for the spouse of
   Christ is not a single person, but a company or society united together
   in the same love and affection, to one common friend, lover and
   husband: and every individual believer, or friend of Christ, is so far
   from monopolizing his love, and desiring to be the only object of it,
   that it is a great addition to the sweetness and happiness of this
   friendship, that others join with him in the same love, and equally
   share in the love and friendship of this glorious friend and
   bridegroom. Each one enjoys as much of Christ's love, has as full and
   large a share in his heart, and enjoys him every way as much, as if he
   had no other lover and friend in the universe: so that, however great
   the number is on whom Christ sets his heart, this does not in any
   degree lessen the privilege and enjoyment of any individual; for he,
   their common friend, has an inexhaustible, infinite fulness, and is
   just as much, and all that, to each single one, as if he was the only
   object of his love. Therefore the more love and benevolence the
   believer has to Christ, and the higher the friendship rises, the more
   pleased will he be to have him esteemed and beloved by others; and the
   more happiness and joy will he have that others share with him in the
   blessings of this friendship, in proportion to his benevolence to them,
   and delight in their welfare; which will always keep pace with his love
   to Christ and delight in him as the best and most glorious friend: so
   that every true friend of Christ is effectually formed and prepared to
   enjoy a peculiar pleasure and happiness in a happy and beautiful
   society, who are equally devoted to this same friendship, and share
   equally with him in the sweet love and affection of his dearest and
   most exalted friend.--This leads to another particular.

Sermon V.

   The friendship of Christians between each other.

   Cant. v. 15. This is my beloved, and this is my friend,

   11. THIS friendship between Christ and the true Christian lays the best
   foundation for union of heart, and sweet, exalted friendship with
   others.

   Christ is the grand medium of all union and friendship in the universe.
   In this respect all things, both which are in heaven and which are on
   earth, are gathered together in One, in Christ. Christ has reconciled
   the angels to men, and made them, who otherwise must have been their
   eternal enemies, great friends to them, and willing to devote
   themselves to the most friendly offices and acts towards the heirs of
   salvation, and spend their whole time, and exert all their powers, in
   ads of kindness, in the most benevolent, friendly manner ministering to
   them. And angels and the redeemed from among men shall finally be
   brought by Christ to dwell together forever, united in the most
   friendly, loving society. And he has not only reconciled God to men,
   and laid a foundation for their reconciliation and union with him; but
   has opened a way, and made full provision, for reconciling men one to
   another, and uniting them in the most dear and happy union and
   friendship, which in many respects surpasses all that there was any
   foundation for in man's primitive state of innocency. Sin has broken
   all bonds of true union and friendship among men; has set them at
   variance one with another, and introduced a most unhappy and horrible
   jar and discord; so that the true character of man in his natural state
   is, "Living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another." Thus
   all true friendship has fled from the earth upon the apostacy of man,
   and that which is most directly contrary to this took place to a most
   awful degree. And man must have remained in this state of hatred and
   enmity one with another forever, had not Jesus Christ undertaken in his
   behalf. He has taken a most wise and effectual method to bring them to
   a union, love and friendship one with another, at the same time that
   they are united to him, and become his friends; a union and friendship
   which is unspeakably dear and sweet, and immensely surpasses all other
   friendships, except that which is between Christ and them. This
   friendship has its foundation in love to Christ, and union of heart to
   him, and is not really any thing distinct and separate from this. The
   believer's love to Christ, and love and friendship to his fellow
   saints, or all that are united to Christ in the same love and
   friendship, is really one and the same undivided flame of love and
   affection; so that the same bond of love which Unites their hearts to
   Christ, does also at the same time unite them to each other t and the
   higher their love and friendship to Christ rises, and the stronger the
   exercises of it are, the more sweet and perfect is their love and
   friendship one to another. And this their love to each other is really
   love to Christ: it is the same affection, exercised and expressed in
   this way. This is represented in this light by Christ himself, when he
   tells us in what a light this matter will be set at the day of
   judgment; "And the King shall answer, and say unto them, Verily I say
   unto you, in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these
   my brethren, ye have done it unto me." If the acts of love and kindness
   which Christians do, one towards another, are really done to Christ,
   and are acts of love to him; then the whole of the love and friendship
   between them, of which these outward acts are the testimony and fruit,
   is really the same thing with love to Christ. This is the great and
   peculiar happiness of this Christian friendship, and renders it a most
   refined, exalted and even divine friendship, and brings them into that
   sweet union, and peculiar oneness, for which their great Friend and
   Patron once prayed: "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also
   which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one,
   as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in
   us."

   The believer's love to Christ, in a sense of his superlative beauty,
   excellence and worthiness, naturally, and even necessarily, leads him
   to love and delight in all those who are in any degree conformed to
   him, and bear his image and likeness: for this is not a different thing
   from loving Christ himself, as this likeness or image of Christ is
   Christ himself formed and living in them. And this likeness to Christ
   will be more especially lovely and charming to the friend of Christ, if
   it consists summarily in love to Christ, in a high esteem of him, and
   true benevolence and affection to him, which is the case here: for the
   more any one loves and esteems Christ, the more desirous he will be
   that others shall love and esteem him, and the more pleased and
   gratified he will be with the love and esteem which others exercise
   towards him; and the more will he love and esteem them, and be more
   benevolent towards them. He whose heart is full of benevolence and good
   will to Christ, must be pleased with and delight in the friendly
   benevolence of others to him; and this will also excite a peculiar
   benevolence and good will to such.

   Besides, in proportion to the love any one has to Christ, he will have
   an affection for those who are beloved by Christ; so that Christ's love
   of benevolence and complacency to his people has great influence in
   uniting them to one another in the dearest love and affection. He who
   greatly loves a dear friend, will naturally love all that are friendly
   to him, and all to whom he is a friend. His being a friend to them will
   necessarily recommend them to him, and render them the objects of his
   complacency and benevolence. This takes place in the case before us, in
   the most happy manner, and to the highest degree. In this view and to
   this purpose it is that Christ proposes his own example of love to his
   disciples, as a motive and inducement to them to love one another, with
   that love and friendship which is peculiar to Christians, as he knew it
   would have the most powerful influence upon them: "This is my
   commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you." No other
   society of friends have such a powerful motive to love one another as
   this which Christ lets before his disciples. He has loved them so as to
   give his life for them, and he has made their interest his own to all
   intents and purposes; and they are dear to him, and precious in his
   light, answerable to what he has done and suffered for them. If
   therefore they love him, if he is honourable and precious in their
   light, and they are friends to his interest; they certainly will love
   those who are so dear to him, and have such an interest in his
   affections. How greatly does this recommend Christians one to another,
   and render them dear and precious in each others' eyes, and promote a
   sweet and noble friendship, which is known to no other person in the
   universe!

   And it may be further observed, that this sweet, humble, Christian
   love, which is the image of Christ's love and grace, serves further to
   endear Christians to each other, and increase and heighten their
   friendship to each other: for there is a peculiar and inexpressible
   sweetness and enjoyment in being beloved by those who are so amiable
   and honourable in our eyes, and with such an ardent, humble, sweet and
   pure affection as Christian love is. The Christian, who has a sensible
   and most pleasing idea of this love and affection, cannot feel himself
   embraced by others with this tender, beautiful, noble love and
   friendship, without an ineffable sensation, which fills his heart with
   the most sweet delight and joy, and kindles a flame in his soul of holy
   love and gratitude to them, in which he returns love for love, and
   embraces them with the arms of the most delightful, tender and
   heart-melting friendship. Thus the mutual love of Christians serves to
   sweeten and increase their affection to each other, and blows the coals
   and kindles up the fire of friendship to a more intense and vehement
   flame. The more sensible any one is that he is the object of the
   Christian love of another, whom he esteems highly as an amiable
   disciple of Christ, and the more evidences and tokens he has of this
   love, the more will his heart be inflamed in love to him; which again
   will increase and heighten the other's love: and thus, by the influence
   of their mutual love and friendship, the sweet flame rises higher and
   higher, until they are all melted and dissolved, and turned into a most
   pure, active, perfect flame: like two brands on fire, which burn flow,
   and give but a moderate heat, when apart; but being put together, by
   the mutual action and influence one on the other, the heat increases
   into a burning flame, which soon sets them all on fire.

   Again: Their being united in the belief of the same system of sweet,
   important truth, and engaged in the same common interest, and in the
   same pursuits, and having the same views, designs, temper and
   disposition; and being, as to substance, in the same state and
   circumstances; in all these respects, and many others, being alike,
   united and bearing a resemblance to each other, like the children of
   one family, united under one kind, wise friend and father; Christians
   being thus united, and bear in Of this likeness to each other in so
   many respects, is many ways a great advantage to this friendship, and
   greatly adds to its beauty and sweetness, and serves to increase their
   love, and the union of their hearts to each other.

   As this is such a pleasant, delightful, as well as noble, important
   theme, in which every Christian has so much concern and experience, it
   is proper and pleasing to add a few words more, and descend into some
   particulars.

   This friendship, which Christians have one with another, by virtue of
   their union and friendship with Christ, the greatest and best friend,
   and the fountain and source of all true friendship among men; this love
   and friendship has true humility as its foundation and basis, and its
   peculiar beauty and glory.

   Pride is most contrary to true friendship, and always interrupts and
   spoils the exercises and enjoyments of it, so far as it takes place.
   Every one's observation and experience will bear an incontestible
   testimony to this, and shews that true friendship is found no where but
   among the meek and humble. Now Christians, by virtue of their love and
   union to Christ, and the friendship with him which has been described,
   are become humble, meek and lowly, so are in a peculiar manner formed
   for true and sweet friendship with each other; a friendship which far
   surpasses that of any other creatures in the universe. Their native
   state and circumstances, sinful, lost, enemies to God and the Saviour,
   infinitely miserable, guilty, odious and ill-deserving, lays a
   foundation for self abasement and humility, when truly discerned and
   understood, which cannot take place to the same degree in any other
   circumstances. And their absolute and exceeding dependence on Christ,
   and his rich, sovereign grace, for righteousness and strength, and
   every good thing, serves to set them low, and abase them forever, in
   their own eyes. And the wonderful, amazing humility of Christ their
   beloved friend, which he exercised in his astonishing stoop and low
   abasement for their sakes, by which he in a sense became the least in
   the kingdom of God, strikes their minds with a peculiar energy, and
   conspires with the above mentioned circumstances to humble them and lay
   them very low. The friends of Christ are therefore in this sense little
   ones; little in their own sight, and in true humility: they have taken
   Christ's yoke upon them, and have learned of him, who is, above all
   others, meek and lowly of heart. And as they have, under the teachings
   of Christ, a clear and affecting view of their own character, as
   sinners, in all its meanness, contemptibleness and odious deformity,
   which they cannot have of others, their fellow Christians, they
   naturally have a much meaner thought of themselves than of others.
   Therefore, in the exercise of this true friendship, they are not
   disposed to exalt themselves, and be jealous of their own honour and
   prerogatives, and be displeased because others do not love, esteem,
   respect and honour them so much as they desire, and they think they
   ought to do. No! but directly the reverse of this; they are ready to
   think others their Christian friends have too high an esteem of them,
   and a love and friendship for them of which they are altogether
   unworthy. Thus Christians are always disposed to abase and humble
   themselves, and, in the exercise of this love and friendship, are
   preferring others, and setting them above themselves: and thus they are
   "kindly affectioned one to another," in the strongest and sweetest
   friendship, "with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another."
   Nothing is done through strife, or vain glory; but, in lowliness of
   mind, each esteems others better than themselves. And, as the chosen,
   holy, beloved friends of Christ, they have "put on bowels of mercies,
   kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long suffering; forbearing one
   another, and forgiving one another, even as Christ has loved and
   forgiven them. As by pride and an haughty spirit cometh contention, so
   the meekness and humility of mind, which is essential to every true
   lover of Christ, prepares true Christians for a sweet, holy and
   intimate friendship one with another, which no other persons are
   capable of, and in which there is a truly noble enjoyment and pleasure,
   which the world can neither give nor take away, and which cannot be
   told to him who has never tasted it.

   Moreover, the uprightness and faithfulness of which every one is
   possessed, who is a friend to Christ, and which is peculiar to them,
   adds a great degree of excellence and happiness to Christian
   friendship, which can be enjoyed in no other union and connection.
   Sincerity, truth and faithfulness come into the very essence of true
   friendship; and the more there is of these, the more safe and happy are
   persons in their friendship. When it may be said of any, what is said
   of the wicked in general, even all that are not friends to Christ,
   "that there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is
   very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with
   their tongue; "they are not capable of true friendship, whatever may
   pass between them that may be called by that name. They may have a sort
   of love and union to one another, on some occasions and in certain
   cases, as a company of pirates or banditti may have a sort of union and
   friendship, grounded wholly upon self love and interest. But this is a
   very low, mean thing at best; it cannot give the enjoyments of true
   friendship; and, such as it is, there can be no dependence upon it,
   that it will continue. It being built on no liable principle, it shifts
   and changes, flourishes or dies, according to external changes, and the
   shifting of humours, interests and circumstances. They may be great
   friends one day, and the next be at swords' points, hating and opposing
   each other more than any body else; improving all their former
   intimacy, and the confidence they had put in each other, as an
   advantage put into their hands of betraying and injuring one another to
   the utmost of their power. There are so many instances of this every
   where among mankind, that every observing person must: have abundant
   evidence of the justice of this remark.

   The true friends and disciples of Christ are of a different character:
   they are sincere, upright, true, and faithful. Therefore they are
   commonly characterized by this in scripture--the upright, the just, the
   faithful; by which they are distinguished from all others. They are of
   a sincere, upright and faithful spirit, which is peculiar to them.
   This, therefore, prepares them for a union and friendship with each
   other, which can be found no where else. They may open their hearts and
   divulge their secrets to each other, without danger of being betrayed,
   and trust and rely on one another with a great degree of confidence and
   safety: and there is a proper foundation for a lasting and growing
   friendship, whatever changes there may be in external circumstances.
   Thus they have the character of Solomon's true friend, who "loveth at
   all times." They love without dissimulation. In obeying the truth,
   through the Spirit, their souls are purified unto unfeigned love of the
   brethren; and they love one another with a pure heart, fervently. He
   who is possessed of Christian sincerity, integrity and faithfulness,
   has a pleasing idea, of which they who are not of this character have
   no true conception; and his heart is united to, and delights in, those
   who appear to be of this character, With a peculiar love and affection.
   And the love of such to each other is not built on any worldly
   circumstances and connections, or self interest. It is a more noble,
   exalted, sincere affection, and is built on more steady, lasting
   principles, of which the poor, if they are the disciples of Christ, are
   as much the objects as the rich: and it goes forth as freely and
   strongly to those who are overlooked and despised by the men of the
   world, as to the great and honourable. How much has such a friendship
   the advantage of all others! and how greatly happy must such friends be
   in each other! Every thing that is called love and friendship, in this
   world, is not worthy the name, when compared with this.

   And the friends of Christ, who are most acquainted with each other, do
   naturally enter more and more into a near, intimate and tender
   friendship. As their acquaintance increases, the higher does their love
   arise. And their mutual kindness and acts of love and helpfulness one
   to another, and constant, earnest prayers for each other, tend to keep
   up and increase their friendship, and render it more and more perfect,
   sweet, delightful and profitable.

   Thus, by virtue and in consequence of Christians' union to Christ, and
   friendship with him, a peculiar, dear love and friendship takes place
   between them, which is the most sincere, exalted, noble and ravishingly
   sweet exercise and enjoyment that can take place among creatures. Their
   souls are united and knit together with the bands of the most; pure,
   strong and Lifting friendship, as the soul of Jonathan was to David,
   when he loved him as his own soul. And as the love and friendship
   between them was, so is that between the friends of Christ; even
   wonderful, passing the love of women. It is unspeakably more pure,
   strong, fervent, sweet, noble, steady and durable, than any affection
   and friendship which takes place between the sexes, or any persons
   whatsoever, which is founded only in instinct, or the principles of
   nature.

   This love and friendship is indeed very imperfe6f in this state,
   through the great imperfection and deficiency of their love to Christ,
   and their holiness; and by reason of that ignorance of each other which
   takes place in a great degree, which prevents their certainly knowing
   who are true friends to Christ, and who are not, and having a full and
   adequate idea of what is truly excellent in them, and their having so
   much about them which is contrary to true friendship, as is all their
   remaining corruption and sinfulness of heart. And this friendship is
   also imperfect in this state, and often, if not always, is the occasion
   of some uneasiness and pain, in the midst of all the sweets of it, by
   reason of external circumstances. They are often banished from each
   others' presence, and obliged to live at a distance, by which their
   acquaintance and intercourse is in a great measure interrupted. But if
   this is not the case, and they have much opportunity to be together,
   and have friendly intercourse, they are liable to misunderstand each
   other, and are often unable to communicate the sentiments and friendly
   exercises of their souls to their friends so clearly as would be
   necessary in order fully to gratify their love and friendship. And,
   besides, Christian friends in this state are liable to, and are
   actually the subjects of, many calamities and distresses of body and
   mind. Now, the more love and benevolence we have for our friends, the
   higher sympathy shall we have with them under their troubles, and their
   burdens and calamities will necessarily become ours in some measure; so
   that the higher degree of love and friendship we have for them, the
   more shall we suffer with them when they are in trouble. And though
   there is a pleasure even in this pain; yet, according to the
   supposition, pain there is, and necessarily will be, in such a
   situation.

   This view of the matter shews us that perfect love and friendship does
   not take place in this state; nor can it exist to the best advantage,
   unless in a state of perfection.

   However, even in this state of weakness and imperfection, where there
   is so much remaining darkness and sin in the best Christian, and there
   are so many disadvantages to friendship, true Christian friendship
   affords the most sweet, refined, noble enjoyment that can be had in
   this life. It surpasses all other friendships, in this respect, more
   than the brightness of the meridian sun exceeds the shining of the
   meanest glow-worm. They are by far the happiest persons on earth, who,
   being friends to Jesus Christ, are, by virtue of this, formed for true
   love and friendship to each other, and are brought into a union and
   oneness of heart and affection, by which they delight in, embrace and
   enjoy each other in the arms of the most pure and ardent love. A
   society of such friends and lovers is the most blessed society on
   earth, whatever their worldly circumstances are. All earthly good, all
   the riches, honours and pleasures of this world, are not to be compared
   with this; yea, they are utterly to be despised and contemned, in
   comparison with this. And all other unions and friendships that take
   place among men, which are not founded on love and friendship to
   Christ, are insipid, mean and worthless, compared with this Christian
   friendship, which has infinitely the advantage of them so many ways.
   This the christless person may disbelieve; and it may be impossible to
   convince him of it, as he has really no true idea of the thing. But he
   who has tasted the sweetness of this friendship, is a witness of the
   refined, superlative pleasures of it, and prefers it to all other
   friendships, unspeakably more than he who is athirst prefers the pure,
   living, crystal stream, to a warm, dirty, putrid puddle. Well may the
   words of the Royal Singer be applied to this noble and happy union and
   friendship: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to
   dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the
   head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down
   to the skirts of his garments."

   There has been comparatively little of this Christian friendship, we
   have reason to believe, in the world, hitherto; but few who have known
   the pleasures of this sacred union; and most of those who have felt and
   exercised a degree of this divine friendship, have had but a very
   imperfect and low degree of it; so that it has never had advantage to
   appear in its true beauty, and happy, glorious effects. This pure,
   soul-exalting and refreshing love to Christ, and union and friendship
   to each other, has yet been a great stranger in this world: but the
   time is coming when the world shall be full of it; when all nations
   shall become the friends and servants of Christ, and that in the
   exercise of a high degree of love to him. And their love and friendship
   one to another will bear a proportion to this. Each one will find
   himself surrounded with those who give satisfying and abundant evidence
   of their love to Christ, and beautiful, growing conformity to him, and
   of their peculiar benevolence to, and delight in, all the disciples of
   Him whom they so ardently love--will therefore see himself loved and
   embraced by them, with the tenderest and mi oft pleasing affection and
   friendship. And how will his heart glow with ardent love to, and sweet
   delight in them, while he associates and converses with them with the
   most dear and unreserved intimacy! yea, their hearts will burn with the
   fire of this sacred love and friendship, whenever they see, or even
   think of, one another. Then every breast shall swell with a degree of
   pleasure and joy, which yet has been but little known; and a happiness,
   which has yet been hardly tailed in this world, shall spread itself
   like a mighty, pure river of delight, over the face of the earth. But
   this friendship will not come to its full perfection and glory in this
   state. We cannot therefore have the most profitable, or even a just
   idea of it, unless we raise our thoughts to that world, and glorious
   kingdom, into which all the friends of Christ will be shortly gathered,
   and united in one most amiable and happy society, in the presence of
   their common, most kind, excellent and exalted friend, in the best
   circumstances, and every way under the highest possible advantages to
   exercise and enjoy the sweetest and most perfect mutual love and
   friendship with Christ and one another. All that precedes this is very
   imperfect, and only preparatory and an introduction to this most
   perfect and happy union and friendship, where the most pure and exalted
   love will be exercised to the highest pitch, without any restraint, and
   so as to give the highest possible enjoyment.

   There their love to Christ will be perfect; they will be all turned
   into a pure and most vehement flame of love to him; and his love will
   be shed abroad, and poured out on them, as most plentiful, refreshing
   floods of water upon the parched ground; which they will drink in with
   the highest relish, and most sacred, ravishing, delight. And they will
   each one appear in the perfect and most amiable image of Christ,
   perfectly excellent, beautiful and lovely, and full of the most sweet
   and lively affection to each other. The more they love Christ, and the
   greater assurance and sense they have of his love to them, the more
   love will they have to each other. They will have the greatest esteem
   of, and complacency in, one another. They will have as free intercourse
   and as great intimacy with each other as they can desire: there will be
   nothing to keep them at the least distance. They will be perfectly
   acquainted with each other, and have the most happy and easy way of
   communicating their thoughts, and pouring out their whole hearts and
   souls into each others' bosoms, and expressing their love to and
   delight in each other. If the intimacy Christian friends have with each
   other here is so pleasant, and it is so sweet to be beloved by them;
   what will it be to be embraced with such strong, constant love, and
   enjoy a familiarity and intimacy, in which they will mingle souls,
   without any reserve or restraint, and which will inconceivably exceed
   the greatest intimacy, and most tender embraces, of the dearest friends
   in this world! How happy must they be whose love is made perfect, and
   flows out to each other, without any restraint, in a most rapid
   torrent, and is gratified every way to the highest possible degree! And
   there will be nothing to cloy or abate this love; it will never fail or
   change, unless it be to grow more ardent and strong. The longer they
   live together, and the more they are acquainted with each other, the
   higher will their love and friendship rise. And their benevolence to
   each other will be pleased and gratified to the highest degree; for
   their friends, to whom they wish so well, are in the most happy
   circumstances, are as happy as they can possibly wish and desire: so
   that all their good will to each other will be exercised and expressed
   in the greatest satisfaction and joy in their happiness. And what kind
   offices, may we suppose, these friends will be constantly doing for
   each other, by which they will gratify and promote the happiness of one
   another!

   And their acquaintance and special connections in this world, and
   especially the good they have been the instruments of doing to each
   other here, will greatly serve to increase and sweeten their love and
   friendship in heaven. With what unspeakable delight will these things
   be remembered and recounted to each other there! With what ineffable
   love and gratitude will the converted and saved embrace those who have
   been the happy instruments of this; while they, on the other hand,
   shall be to such the occasion of their peculiar joy, and their crown of
   rejoicing forever, and be embraced by them with inexpressible
   tenderness, love and delight.--And, Oh, how wall they that have been
   most intimately acquainted here, and united in love, and have most
   abounded in ads of kindness and friendship to each other, and have been
   greatly instrumental many ways of promoting the spiritual good and
   salvation of each other; how will such, however they may be parted by
   death for a while, meet, with peculiar and unspeakable joy, in that
   world, and love and embrace each other forever in the arms of the most
   tender, sweet, exalted, growing friendship! In a word, there shall be
   no sinful mixtures in their love and friendship, and no defects, as
   there always are here; but it will be most pure and untainted. The more
   they love one another, not the less, but the more, will they love
   Jesus, their common friend: there will be no need of caution and
   restraint; no danger of running to excess. There will be the most
   perfect, refined pleasure, without the least pain, which unavoidably
   attends the most exalted friendship in this world. All the tears their
   friendship has occasioned here shall be forever wiped from their eyes.
   There shall be nothing but the most perfect, sweet union and harmony;
   nothing in the way of their expressing their love, and enjoying each
   other, without the least danger or fear of having it interrupted, or of
   their being parted from the friendly embraces of each other, to all
   eternity. What a world of love and friendship will this be! Though all
   who enter into the school of Christ have some experience of the sweets
   and happiness of this friendship, yet how low and childish are our
   thoughts and conceptions of this matter. Surely eye hath not seen, nor
   ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of any of the saints,
   the things which Christ has laid up for them that love him, and have
   entered into this divine friendship with him, and with each other,

   A little of this friendship, in this world, naturally, and even
   necessarily, leads these Christian friends, while they feel the
   imperfections, impediments and interruptions of this love and
   friendship here, to look forward to, and long for, that perfect state,
   where this divine affection shall be exercised and gratified to the
   highest degree, and they shall eternally swim in a boundless ocean of
   love. The more this friendship flourishes in their breasts now, the
   more weaned are they from earth, and all its enjoyments; the more are
   their hearts fixed on heaven, and the higher and stronger are their
   longings for the enjoyment of the society and friendship of that world
   of love; and the greater is their hope and assurance of enjoying it
   forever.

   And who can be willing to live and die a stranger to this Christian
   love and friendship, and so miss of that world of happiness in which it
   shall issue, and where it shall flourish forever! Who can be content to
   give up his heart to that love and those friendships only, which are
   attended with certain disappointment, and only serve to perplex and
   torture the mind, and will assuredly issue in darkness, horror, and
   eternal hatred and discord!

   Blessed, unspeakably blessed, are they in whose hearts this love and
   friendship is begun; who, because they love Christ, love his people
   also; and know that they love Christ, and have passed from death to
   life, because they love the brethren.

   Let us then love one another, not in word, neither in tongue only, but
   in deed and in truth; that hereby we may know that we are of the truth,
   and assure our hearts before God. For this is his commandment, that we
   believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another.

SERMON VI.

   The Friendship between Jesus Christ and Believers.

   Cant. v. 16. This is my beloved, and this is my friend.

   I PROCEED to mention other particulars relating to Jesus Christ,
   considered in the character of the believer's friend, and the
   distinguished privileges and happiness of this friendship.

   12. Jesus Christ is an unchangeably faithful and everlasting friend.
   Faithfulness is essential to the character of a friend: without this
   there can be no safety in intimacy with and confidence in him. Through
   unfaithfulness and inconstancy professed friends often betray one
   another; and many friendships are very short-lived, and dissolve and
   turn into enmity and discord. But Christ is a most faithful,
   unchangeable friend. He never will forsake those who give themselves up
   to this friendship; but will do all for them, and be all to them, that
   they trust in him for, or can expect from him, in the character of a
   most able and kind friend; yea, he will always outdo all their
   expectations and wishes. Moreover, he will take effectual care to
   secure and perpetuate their love and friendship to him; so that the
   friendship on their parts shall never cease after it is once begun. We
   have great need of such a friend as this: yea, such a friend is
   absolutely necessary for us in this state of weakness, darkness and
   sin, and where we are surrounded with innumerable, implacable enemies
   to Christ and to us; who are potent and subtle, and are continually
   doing their utmost to prevent, interrupt and destroy this friendship.
   If Christ was not security for us in this respect; if he was not able,
   and had not undertaken, to prevent our falling away from this union and
   friendship; alas I how soon should we break our most solemn engagements
   and vows, violate the most sacred obligations, and ties of the dearest
   friendship, and turn enemies to the greatest and best of friends! There
   is no trust to be put in any man with respect to this. But in him there
   is safety; he has engaged that they who once choose him as their
   Almighty and best friend, shall persevere in their love to him. And he
   is faithful who has promised. With regard to this, the eternal God and
   Redeemer is their refuge, and underneath every faint are the
   everlasting arms of this Almighty and most faithful friend and Saviour.
   This is he who was Peter's friend, and prayed that his faith and love
   might not fail in the fore trial and dangerous conflict he had to go
   through. And it was wholly owing to his care and faithfulness, that
   Peter did not wholly fall from his friendship to Christ; but his trial
   and fall were the occasion of the increase of his love to his best,
   most faithful and dearest friend, so that it soon rose to such an
   ardent flame, that he was able with the greatest confidence to say,
   "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee." Such a
   friend have all who love our Lord Jesus Christ; in sincerity; for whom
   he once loves, he always loves to the end. How safe and secure then do
   they feel themselves in this love and friendship, that it shall
   certainly continue and flourish to eternity, who are able to say. This
   is my beloved, and this is my friend!

   13. Christ is a most meek, tender, compassionate, forgiving friend.

   If he did not excel in these things to an infinite degree, he could not
   be our friend. We have injured him more than any other person in the
   universe; and have done more to affront him, and provoke him to anger,
   than ever was done to any other. And even his friends have
   comparatively but a very small degree of love and friendship to him; it
   is a mere nothing, compared to, what they ought to have, and he is most
   worthy of. They are guilty of the most amazing, stupidity, and base
   ingratitude, and in many ways and respects act a most foolish, wicked
   and unfriendly part towards him, by which they are violating the most
   sacred laws of friendship, and the highest imaginable obligations. No
   friend but this in the universe would bear such treatment, and yet
   continue his love and friendship. And was he not meek, tender,
   compassionate and long suffering beyond any parallel, he would so
   resent such treatment and horrid abuse of him as to withdraw his
   friendship, and renounce them forever. But as a tender father pitieth
   his children, so he pitieth his friends; he is long-suffering, abundant
   in goodness and tender mercy, and ready to forgive all their folly, and
   wicked abuse of his love. He will forgive them, not seven times only,
   but seventy times seven; yea, without any bounds or limits. His loving
   kindness he will not utterly take from them, nor suffer his
   faithfulness to fail. We have a striking instance of this in his
   treatment of his friends when he was on earth. They remained in a great
   degree ignorant and unteachable under his constant instructions. They
   were inattentive, stupid, perverse and unbelieving, in a manner and
   degree that was very criminal and provoking. Yet he bore with them, and
   forgave them, and continued his love and kindness to them. He continued
   to treat them with the greatest tenderness and love. He constantly
   attended to their interest, and laboured for their good, and his love
   and gentleness made them great. in the last hours of his life, when the
   dreadful scene of his sufferings for his people was just before him,
   he, as a most tender friend, accommodated himself to their weakness; he
   attended to their case, their sorrow and trouble touched his heart, and
   he pitied them? and set himself to instruct and comfort them, in the
   most kind and tender manner. Such an astonishingly kind, tender and
   forgiving friend had they. And with transports of joy may every one of
   his true disciples say. This is my beloved, and this is my friend.

   14. Christ is the most wise, kind and able physician, to heal and cure
   all his friends of the disorders and diseases that attend them. Such a
   friend they want, and ho other could answer the end of a friend to them
   but such an one. He finds them in a most dreadful condition, even dead
   in trespasses and sins. They are undone and slain, having died a most
   shockingly dreadful and truly accursed death. Their souls are bruised
   and mangled in the most horrible manner, and torn all to pieces, as it
   were, limb from limb. And the devil, who has had a great hand in the
   horrible slaughter, and has the power of death, sits brooding over and
   watching his prey. In this respect they may be compared to a dead
   corpse of one who has been most cruelly broken on the rack, every joint
   being dislocated, and each bone broken to pieces, and all the flesh
   terribly bruised, and torn from the bones and sinews. In this state
   Christ finds them. He dispossesses the devil, and breathes into them a
   degree of life, and healing influence. He finds them thus cast out as
   in the open field, and speaks the sovereign, omnipotent word, and bids
   them live: and that time is a time of love. The soul in the exercise of
   this new life cleaves to Christ as its healer and husband, and becomes
   his in a covenant of love and friendship which never can be broken.
   Christ brings them into his house, and his banner over them is love. He
   binds up their wounds, pouring in oil and wine; and washes away their
   blood from them. And now do they first begin to have a degree of
   sensibility, and to feel their dreadful disorders, their wounds,
   bruises, and putrefying sores. They who are wholly dead in trespasses
   and sins, and under the dominion of enmity against God and the
   Redeemer, are in this respect like the dead corpse: whatever dreadful
   wounds and disorders, are upon them, they are quite insensible of the
   matter. But as soon as a degree of life and restoration takes place,
   there is a proportionable degree of sensibility: they feel their
   disorders and wounds, and the need they stand in of healing; and that
   they want a physician infinitely distinguished from any mere creature
   in wisdom, power and goodness; who has a remedy which no other has or
   can have. They see Christ to be such a physician. They immediately say,
   "There is balm in Gilead, there is a physician there, exactly suited to
   my case." And into his hand they commit their disordered souls,
   despairing of a cure, unless wrought by his most skilful, tender hand.
   Christ, as their most faithful and kind friend, undertakes for them. He
   faithfully and constantly attends to their case; searches every wound
   to the bottom, and applies the best remedy, and that in the wisest
   manner, and in the best and most seasonable time; so that the cure in
   the end may be most: complete and perfect, not leaving spot or wrinkle,
   or any such thing, and attended with the most advantageous
   consequences. And he will never leave them till he has completed it, He
   could indeed cure them perfectly, all at once, at a word's speaking, as
   he did many bodily diseases when he was on earth, and not go into such
   a long process, and continued course of applications, under which the
   patient is often put to much pain, and seems to himself to grow worse,
   rather than better, and sometimes is ready to despair of a cure, and
   say, "All these things are against me." But he takes the latter and not
   the former method, because that, on the whole, it is far the wisest and
   best; the cure is much more perfect and glorious in the end, and
   attended with consequences unspeakably more happy for the subjects of
   it. How happy then are the friends of Christ in this respect! They are
   connected with, and united to, a friend, who is a most skilful and kind
   physician, and has furnished himself with every remedy that is needed,
   to heal and cure them, under their singular, and otherwise desperate,
   disorders. And he is infinitely engaged in the best manner to effect
   the most complete, happy and glorious cure, and that without money and
   without price. He is the Lord, that bindeth up the breach of his
   people, and healeth the stroke of their wound. O Christian, This is thy
   beloved, and this is thy friend!

   15. Christ is a friend who is infinitely happy, is independent and self
   sufficient, and has the highest honours in the universe put upon him.

   This is an unspeakable advantage in this friendship, and renders it
   immensely more sweet and happy to the friends of Christ than it could
   otherwise be. If our friend is in a state of calamity and suffering, in
   any respect and degree, or is exposed to calamity and evil, it of
   course becomes our calamity, and we necessarily share in the evil with
   him, in a degree proportionable to our benevolence and friendship. This
   renders friendship very unhappy in many instances in this world,
   because the beloved person is very unhappy. For true benevolence to our
   friend is crossed by every degree of evil that he suffers, and desires
   he may have all the honour and happiness he is capable of; and
   therefore cannot be perfectly satisfied and pleased with any thing
   short of this. And if our friend is as much honoured and as happy as we
   can imagine and desire, this will give us an enjoyment, and render the
   friendship sweet and happy, in proportion to the degree to which it
   rises and is exercised. For, as we necessarily dare in the evil that
   our friend suffers, so we do in his happiness. There is therefore the
   best foundation laid for happiness. in this friendship, that in the
   nature of things can be, whereby our love and benevolence to Christ is
   gratified, and pleased to the highest possible degree.

   Christ has indeed been subjected to a state of calamity and suffering;
   he has suffered disgrace and pain to the most amazing degree, and that
   for his friends: but he has, on the whole, lost nothing by it. If he
   had, this would have been an undesirable circumstance, which could not
   possibly be removed, but must have been an alloy to this friendship,
   and a source of uneasiness to the friends of Christ, forever. For it
   will necessarily give pain to any one who has entered into true
   friendship with another, to have his friend a loser in any respect,
   especially to have him in the least degree a loser on his account. He
   cannot bear to think of being an injury or disadvantage to his friend
   in any reaped, and that, on the whole, he should be a loser by him; and
   it is as impossible to reconcile true love and friendship to this, as
   to unite the opposite parts of a contradiction. But what Christ has
   suffered for his people is, in this respect, no disadvantage to this
   friendship; for, as has been just now observed, he has on the whole
   lost nothing by it, but has been an infinite gainer. His humiliation
   and sufferings, even unto death, have been the occasion of his greater
   happiness, and high exaltation. By this means, and in this way, he has
   been anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows, and been made
   to drink of the river of God's pleasures: and this has been the
   occasion of his being made king of Zion, and raised to the throne of
   the universe, invested with all power in heaven and on earth, as the
   sole ruler in God's moral kingdom, and final judge of all. Because he
   thus humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of
   the cross, therefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
   which is above every name. He is richly rewarded, more than ten
   thousand fold, for all he expended and suffered for the redemption of
   his people, and their redemption and salvation is the occasion of a
   high degree of happiness and honour, which he could have obtained no
   other way.

   This does not indeed lessen their obligations to him, for what he has
   done and suffered for them, in the least imaginable degree; for they
   are every way as great as if he had been an infinite loser by the
   means. But this is suited to gratify and please his benevolent friends
   to the highest degree, and add a sweetness and joy to their friendship,
   inexpressible. The language of their friendly, benevolent hearts is,
   "Let him be most blessed forever: let him be exalted in the glory of
   his salvation, and have all the honours of the universe given to him."
   And when they see him exalted, honoured and blessed, as heir of the
   whole universe, and independent Lord and possessor of all things; and
   that this is the consequence and reward of what he has done for the
   redemption of sinners, with what unbounded joy must their hearts
   expand! while, with the most sweet, ineffable delight, they join their
   hearty Amen, and say, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, was dead and
   is alive, and liveth forever more, to receive power, and riches, and
   wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. To him be
   glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen" This circumstance greatly
   adds to the happiness of this friendship, and spreads ineffable
   sweetness through the soul of the true Christian, when he is able to
   say, "This is my beloved, and this is my friend."

   1 6. All that Christ requires of his friends is, to act the part of
   friends to him, and to maintain, cultivate and improve this friendship
   between him and them.

   This greatly recommends him as a friend, and is a happy circumstance of
   this friendship between him and his people. His condescension, love and
   goodness to his friends, and the intimacy and unreserved familiarity to
   which he admits them, have been already particularly considered. He
   does not take state on himself so as in any degree to keep them at a
   distance; nor does he impose heavy burdens on them, and subject them to
   hard, slavish service, as the master does his servants, in order to
   their enjoying his favour and friendship. No; he docs not call them
   servants, nor in any respect treat them as such; but he calls them
   Friends, and treats them according to this most dear, soft and tender
   name. And all he expects and requires of them is, that they cleave to
   him as their friend, and as becomes his true friends, and in all
   respects aft up to this most endeared and exalted character. In this
   regard the law of Christ is nothing but a law of love and friendship,
   as nothing else is required; it is therefore called the perfect law of
   liberty. All that Christ requires of his friends is, that they return
   love for love; that they receive and cleave to him in all proper ways,
   as their Almighty, infinitely excellent, kind, bountiful and benevolent
   friend; that they constantly look to him, and trust in him, as such,
   for all they want; relying wholly on his friendship and goodness, and
   being heartily willing, with all thankfulness, delight and joy, to be
   wholly and infinitely indebted to him for all things, as being in
   themselves nothing but emptiness, insufficiency, wretchedness, guilt
   and deformity; heartily acquiescing in it that he should do the office
   of such a friend to them; that they heartily love, esteem, honour and
   rejoice in him, in this character; live a life of nearness and intimacy
   with him, and follow him wheresoever he goes; and do all those acts of
   love and kindness to him that become his friends, and by which they may
   properly express and discover their true and superlative love and
   friendship to him. Thus he tells his disciples that he required nothing
   of them but that in which they might express and evidence their
   friendship to him. "Ye are my friends," says he, "if ye do whatsoever I
   command you."

   What a sweet and delightful work then are all the friends of Christ
   called to! viz. to love the most excellent, worthy, dear and kind
   friend, and cultivate the greatest intimacy and most sweet friendship
   with him. In one word, he only requires them to be happy in him, in the
   nearest and highest enjoyment of him as their friend, in the exercise
   and gratification of an inclination and affection, which gives the most
   ravishingly sweet and delightful enjoyment that in nature can be.
   Surely all the friends of Christ may say from their own experience,
   "His yoke is easy, and his burden light. His commandments are not
   grievous, but perfectly delightful; and in keeping them there is a
   great reward. The ways of wisdom are pleasantness, and all her paths
   are peace. We have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as
   in all riches." And now, O Christian, what does the Lord, thy
   all-sufficient friend and Redeemer, require of thee, but to say, with
   joy unspeakable and full of glory. This is my beloved, and this is my
   friend, and live answerable to such a high profession and character?

   17. Another advantage and peculiar happiness of this friendship is,
   that the friends of Christ have just as much evidence that He is their
   friend, as they have that they are friends to him; and this evidence
   rises, and is clear, in proportion to the degree of exercise of love
   and friendship to him.

   It has been observed, that it is essential to true love and friendship
   for any one to desire to be the object of his love, and to have him his
   friend, on whom he has set his affections. And the more sincere and
   strong our friendly affection and love to another is, the more do we
   desire to be the objects of his love and friendship; and the greater
   uneasiness and pain will attend suspicions of his love to us. As it is
   the sweetest, happiest thing in the world, even the highest enjoyment
   we can imagine, to be beloved, especially by those for whom we have an
   high esteem, and a strong and most friendly affection; so, perhaps,
   nothing is more disagreeable, or will give a more sensible, cutting
   pain, than to find ourselves neglected and quite cast off by such. And
   this is eminently true in the case before us. True friendship to Christ
   does render it above all things desirable to him that exercises it, to
   be the object of Christ's love and favour. And to be cast off by him,
   and be the object of his displeasure and wrath, is to such an one,
   above any thing else, undesirable and dreadful. In this case, above any
   other, "Love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave: the
   coals thereof are coals of fire, even a most vehement flame."

   This has often proved a great unhappiness in human love and friendship,
   especially that which takes place between the sexes. Many a one has
   been most cruelly tortured and undone by this. They have had a vehement
   affection and love for another, while they have found themselves not
   beloved, but slighted and despised: this has proved to them an
   insupportable burden, spread darkness over all things under the sun,
   rendered them incapable of enjoying any thing, and made them weary of
   their own life; and has often put an end to it by a lingering, cruel
   death.

   But the friends of Christ are in this respect most happy. They can no
   further doubt of his love to them, than they question their own love
   and friendship to him. If they love him, and are his true friends, he
   is certainly their friend. Yea, if they love him in sincerity, though
   in never so imperfect and low a degree, they are the objects of his
   love, and a friendship is begun between Christ and them which will
   continue forever. For this Christ has given his word to all his
   friends. He has said, "I love them that love me; and he that loveth me,
   I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him. And him that cometh
   to me, 1 will in no wise cast out."

   We want nothing then, in order to be assured that Christ loves us with
   a strong and everlasting love, and is our unchangeable friend, but to
   know that we love him: or, in other words, we may be certain that
   Christ loves us, so far as we have good evidence that we sincerely
   desire and prize his love and friendship. And our evidence of this will
   be in proportion to the degree of our love to him, or the strength and
   constancy of our affection and friendship. This is true in all
   instances of love and affection to any friend; the evidence that we do
   love them, and are their friends, will be in proportion to the degree
   and constancy of the exercise of our love and friendship to them, and
   the expression of it in all proper ways. This love always evidences
   itself, and is attended with a consciousness that it does exist in our
   hearts, in proportion to the strength and constancy of its exercise;
   and we may love a friend to such a degree, as to remove all doubt, yea,
   render us absolutely assured that we do love him.

   So it is in this case; if we doubt whether we are true friends of Jesus
   Christ, it must be because we are not so, or are so in a very weak and
   low degree, and with great inconstancy, and there is much in our hearts
   and actions directly contrary to love and friendship. And as this love
   rises, and becomes more and more a constant, vigorous exercise and
   flame in the heart, the Christian will have higher evidence and greater
   confidence that he is a friend to Christ; and consequently that Christ
   is his friend. And nothing is wanting but a constant, vigorous exercise
   of this love, in order to a constant consciousness and prevailing
   assurance that this glorious person is our beloved, and consequently
   that he loves us, and is our friend.

   Thus we see how happy this friendship is in this respect, by which it
   is distinguished from all other friendships whatsoever. Full provision
   is made for the gratification of love to Christ in all respects. In
   proportion as the Christian loves Christ, he enjoys him, and his love
   and friendship is gratified and pleased, in a sense and evidence of
   Christ's love to him. So far as he prizes Christ's love, and really
   desires to have him his friend, from true love to him, and has a sense
   and evidence that he does love him, just so far he has a sense and
   evidence that Christ actually is his friend, and does love him; so that
   this desire is gratified and answered, and turned into a degree of
   sweet enjoyment, in proportion to the strength and constancy of it.
   When the Christian therefore can with confidence say, "This is my
   beloved," he may with equal assurance add, "This is my friend." For
   these God has joined together: and nothing, neither angels, nor
   principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
   height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be ever able to
   separate them.

   18. This friendship between Christ and the believer will reconcile men
   to death, and support and comfort them under the death of others, their
   Christian friends.

   It tends to make death desirable and sweet. Friends have been so united
   in this world, and had such a love for each other, that if one must
   die, the other would choose to die with him; and so the death of one
   has made death desirable to the other. But the friendship of which I am
   speaking has a much more powerful influence this way, in many respects.
   When a friend to Christ, with his heart full of love to him, looks into
   the grave, and considers that there his dearest Lord and friend once
   lay, this will sweeten the grave to him, and make the thought of laying
   his head in the dust pleasant, and he will be ready to say, with one of
   his friends of old, "Let me die with him." Besides, friendship to
   Christ reconciles to death, and renders it desirable, and the thought
   of it sweet, as it is the only way to the full enjoyment of Christ, and
   a dwelling with him in his holy and glorious kingdom. The friend of
   Christ longs to be delivered from all contrariety to him, as what is
   most odious, and the greatest burden, and to get rid of all ignorance,
   and coldness, and indifference, towards him, and be turned into a
   perfect, pure flame of: love to him; to dwell in his presence, and
   honour, praise and serve him day and night: and when he sees death to
   be the only way to this, he is not only reconciled to it, but is ready
   to long for it. And when he sees that his Almighty Friend has conquered
   death, and taken away the sting of it, with what courage and joy can he
   look it in the face; while with him who was one of Christ's great
   friends on earth seventeen hundred years ago, and is now with him in
   heaven, he desires to depart and be with Christ, which to him is far
   the best of any thing he can conceive of or wish for.

   Again, this friendship with Christ gives the best support under the
   death of dear Christian friends, and lays a foundation even for comfort
   in it. Herein it has the advantage of all other friendships. The more
   strongly they take place, the more is death dreaded; because this puts
   an utter end to the friendship, and cuts off all hopes of ever seeing
   and enjoying one another again. It is in this view that St. Paul speaks
   of the sorrow and mourning of those that were no Christians, on the
   death of their dear friends, as those who have no hope. They are left
   quite disconsolate on the death of their friends, because they have no
   hope of ever seeing and enjoying them again. But Christians have no
   reason to mourn so. They may part with each other here with high hopes
   and full assurance of meeting again in a short time, and enjoying each
   other, to a much higher degree, and in a better manner, than ever they
   did before, in the presence of Christ, in his glorious kingdom.

   When our dear Christian friends are torn from our fond embraces, and we
   are deprived of their sweet company, and know we shall see them no more
   on earth; the more we love Christ, and the greater is our benevolence
   to them, the more comfort and joy shall we have in the thought, that
   they have ceased from sin, yea, from all their labours and troubles,
   and are gone to be with Christ, our great and common friend, and enjoy
   the benefits of this friendship to an immensely higher degree than we
   can here; that they will soon be restored to us, with great advantage,
   and we shall see them in Christ's kingdom, unspeakably more loving and
   lovely than they were here; and, in a much more noble and perfect
   friendship, shall reap the happy consequence, and all the advantages,
   of our acquaintance and friendship here, and be forever with the Lord,
   our glorious Friend and Redeemer. Surely Christians may well, under the
   loss of their dearest friends, comfort one another with these words.

   19. Christ will bring his friends to the nearest enjoyment of himself,
   and communion with him, where they shall taste the growing sweets of
   his love and friendship forever.

   This is one peculiar excellency and privilege of this friendship, and
   what crowns all, that, with all its superior excellence and sweetness,
   and with every other advantage, and desirable circumstance, it will
   never come to an end, but will continue, flourish and increase forever.
   The many and great disadvantages and imperfections that attend it in
   this state shall soon wholly cease; and every thing desirable, and that
   can possibly advance it, in any respect and degree, shall take place,
   and that unspeakably beyond the highest flights of the warmest and
   brightest imagination. This has been repeatedly brought into view, and
   in several particulars that have been mentioned; but it is so important
   an article of this friendship, that it seems to deserve our more
   particular attention.

   This friendship is in this world very sweet, and exceeds all others,
   both in its excellency and in the enjoyment it gives. But this is but a
   low beginning of something immensely more exalted and happy; and is
   only preparatory to that which shall be most perfect and everlasting.
   This friendship is exceeding imperfect in this state, has many
   interruptions and hindrances, and is attended with numerous
   inconveniences, which often occasion great pain and distress, which is
   peculiar to the friends of Christ, and is many times very keen, and
   even overwhelming. Their remaining degrees of unfriendliness and
   opposition of heart to Christ, their blindness, stupidity, ingratitude;
   their great degree of alienation from Christ, their unfruitfulness, and
   the ill returns they make to him, and their want of a sense of his love
   and favour, are a most heavy burden to them, under which they often go
   mourning all the day long. For these things their souls are bowed down,
   and greatly disquieted within them. And their love to Christ, and
   concern for his interest in the world, is often the occasion of great
   concern and trouble, while they live in: such a wicked world as this,
   in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, where there are so
   many enemies to Christ, and his cause is in so many ways opposed and
   run down. These things often cause them to hang their harps on the
   willows, in this strange land, and to lit down and weep when they
   remember Zion, and the interest of their Friend and Redeemer; and
   livers of water run down their eyes, because men keep not his law, but
   dishonour him. And the higher their love and friendship to Christ
   rises, the more affecting and painful will these things be to them;
   like the dear friends of Christ, the holy women who followed him
   weeping, when he went to the cross, surrounded by an insulting crowd of
   cruel enemies. Their love to Christ, their dearest friend, filled their
   hearts with the keenest twinges of the most cutting pain, which, as a
   dreadful sword, pierced their souls through and through. But it is
   wisely and kindly ordered that this friendship should begin in such a
   state as this, and in these circumstances; and this will all turn to
   its great advantage in the issue, and prepare the way for a higher
   enjoyment than if they had never taken place. Christ, their great
   friend and patron, superintends, and is in this way disciplining them,
   and in the best manner training them up for the near enjoyment of him
   in the most perfect state of friendship and happiness. They are
   espoused to him, though they are in an enemy's country; and he is
   preparing them for the happy nuptials, when they shall be brought into
   his presence, and kind embraces, never to part again. And all their
   pain and sorrow in this world, which they have suffered on his account,
   and all they have done and suffered for him, shall in the end serve to
   increase their enjoyment and happiness, and be richly rewarded by him.

   He has desired and prayed that they all may be where he is, that they
   may behold his glory, and enjoy him to the best advantage, and in the
   highest decree; and he will never rest till he has brought them to
   this. He will bring them to share in his own honours and happiness, as
   fully as their enlarged capacities will admit. He will seat them at his
   own right hand; yea, they shall sit down with him on his throne, and
   reign jointly with him, as the queen shares in the dignity and honours
   of the prince her husband. They shall drink with him of the river of
   his pleasures, and enjoy all that he has, even the whole of his
   boundless riches and most extensive kingdom. He will bring forth all
   his hidden treasures for them, and open his heart to them in the
   fullest manner and without any reserve. He will make them perfectly
   like himself, and put his own beauty and glory upon them, and bring
   them to a high and perfect relish for his beauty, and put them, in all
   respects, and every way, under the best advantage to love and enjoy him
   forever. This shall perfect this friendship, which will be increasing
   in unknown, inconceivable heights forever and ever.

   Thus they shall be satisfied, perfectly satisfied, and inconceivably
   happy, when they shall awake in his likeness, and stand complete before
   him, the beloved of their souls, in whose presence is fulness of joy,
   and at whose right hand are pleasures forever more. Then it will be
   said concerning every one of the true friends of Christ, "These are
   they which came but of great tribulation, and have washed their robes,
   and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before
   the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and He
   that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no
   more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun light on them, nor
   any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed
   them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God
   shall wipe away all tears from their eyes." Then shall Christ appear,
   in all his fulness and glory, as the head of his church, and, in the
   highest and most emphatical sense, say, "I am come into my garden, my
   sister, my spouse. Eat, O friends, drink, yea, drink abundantly." Then
   the angels will tune their notes higher than ever, and say, with a
   voice like the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty
   thunderings, "Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to Him., the
   glorious friend and bridegroom of the redeemed; for the marriage of the
   Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready"

   The friends of Christ now little think what they are coming to, and
   what will be the issue of these exercises they now have. They have
   already seen and enjoyed what others never have; for Christ in his
   superlative glory and excellence has been manifested unto them: but
   they shall see greater things than these. And the words which Christ
   spoke to one of his disciples when he was on earth, are applicable to
   all of them: "What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shall know
   hereafter." "Beloved, now we are the sons of God, the friends of
   Christ; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,
   when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he
   is."

SERMON VII.

   On Christian Friendship.

   Cant. v. 16. This is my beloved, and this is my friend

APPLICATION.

   1. THIS subject as it has been considered affords great evidence of the
   truth and divinity of Christianity, and of all the great and leading
   doctrines; and at the same time shows how the Christian, though not
   learned, or of great natural capacity, is assured that it is a
   revelation from the only true God, and will give eternal life and
   happiness to all who cordially embrace it.

   If the gospel is formed and suited to give those who embrace it the
   highest and most refined and noble enjoyment, which is the beginning of
   most complete and endless happiness; if, so far as it has its proper
   and genuine influence on the hearts and lives of men, it spreads
   happiness through society, and forms all to a happy union, by which
   they promote, enjoy and rejoice in the welfare of each other; and
   brings them into a friendship, which is in the nature of it perfect,
   having nothing undesirable, and nothing wanting to render it the most
   excellent, noble and durable love and friendship that can be imagined;
   then it must be divine, a revelation from heaven, the production of
   Infinite Wisdom and Goodness. But that all this is true, has been made
   abundantly evident, by the very imperfect representation in the
   preceding discourses. And it is sufficiently supported by the scripture
   itself, by impartial reason, and by abundant experience,

   This scheme of friendship and happiness for man never would have been
   thought of by any one of the human race, had it not been revealed from
   heaven. Hence it is made certain that no other scheme of religion, but
   that revealed in the Bible, is true, or can make men happy by embracing
   it; and that all other methods to obtain happiness, of which there are
   many devised by the wit and learning of the most sagacious among men,
   are mere delusions, and never will or can obtain it. For when the world
   by their wisdom knew not God, or the way to true happiness, it pleased
   God, by the foolishness of preaching, to save, and make completely and
   eternally happy, all them who believe.

   But the unbeliever will say, "I do not pretend to understand the
   scriptures; but I am certain that my reason and experience dictate that
   there is no happiness in attending to the Bible, but very much the
   contrary. And the spread of Christianity in the world has been far from
   making mankind more happy than they were without it. It has been the
   occasion of unspeakable calamity. And even professing Christians,
   instead of being united by it in love and friendship, have been the
   greatest enemies to each other, and destroyed one another in the most
   cruel manner."

   Answer. That such have received no happiness by the attention they have
   paid to the Bible, is not an argument of the least weight that it is
   not to be found there. Men may come to the Bible with a strong and
   prevailing disposition and taste of mind or heart which does not relish
   that in which true happiness consists; but is highly disgusted and
   displeased with it. With this vitiated taste they relish and seek after
   happiness, where it cannot be found, being wholly blind to these
   spiritual, noble objects and truths, in the knowledge and enjoyment of
   which there is the highest happiness. And such a wrong taste and
   disposition tends to bias their understanding and reason, so as to
   render it partial, and incline to speculative error. It is therefore to
   impartial reason that we appeal.

   This blindness, which consists in a wrong taste and disposition of
   mind, the scripture speaks of as common to all men in their natural
   state; and when it so commonly takes place, it is a confirmation of the
   truth of the scripture: "The natural man receiveth not the things of
   the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he
   know them, because they are spiritually discerned."

   As to the effect which Christianity has had in the world, it is
   acknowledged that where it has been perverted and abused, it has been
   the occasion of much evil. The best things are capable of abuse, and of
   being made the occasion of great misery. But this is no argument
   against their excellency, and tendency to the greatest good, when
   improved according to their nature. In order to be under advantages, to
   determine this question, we must study the Bible, and learn what are
   the doctrines and precepts contained in it. Every one who with
   impartiality and a right or good taste does this, sees what
   Christianity is, and knows that in conformity to it, the greatest
   peace, love and friendship, and the most pure and noble happiness, is
   to. be enjoyed; though an abuse of it may be attended with the worst
   consequences.

   This brings into view the other part of the inference we are
   considering, viz. that the true Christian has a constant evidence in
   his own mind that Christianity is from heaven, and will give complete
   and eternal life and happiness to all who embrace it. They have found
   and tailed this happiness, consisting in Christian friendship to Christ
   and to all who appear to bear his image, and know that nothing is
   wanting in order to their complete felicity forever, but to have this
   friendship perfected, and attended with every circumstance favourable
   to it. They are sure this scheme is from heaven, and has a divine stamp
   upon it, as it is as much beyond man to form it, as to create the
   world. They may not be able to produce all which is called the external
   evidence of the truth of Christianity, or to answer all the subtle
   cavils and objections and witty scoffs of infidels, but are able to
   say, with the primitive Christians, "We know that the Son of God has
   come, and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is
   true. This is. the true God, and eternal life." And they are witnesses
   to the truth declared by their beloved Lord and Saviour: "This is
   eternal life, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus
   Christ whom thou hast sent." They have found the treasure hid in a
   field, the pearl of great price. They have found all they want to make
   them eternally happy; and cheerfully forsake and give up every thing
   else, and renounce all hopes or desires of any other happiness, for the
   sake of these.

   II. How happy are the true friends of Christ! They have a degree of
   sweet enjoyment and happiness now, which strangers intermeddle not
   with, in love and union of heart to Christ and their fellow saints.
   They taste the sweets of Christian friendship, in comparison with which
   all other enjoyments are low, insipid and worthless. They see such
   superlative, ravishing beauty and excellence in their most beloved
   friend, that they are become insensible and dead to all those objects
   which glitter in the eyes of the world, and charm their hearts, by
   which they are hurried on in the pursuit of them with the greatest
   eagerness. They have a friend of such excellence and worth, that it
   will take an eternity to tell what he is, and make a full display of
   his sufficiency and perfections. What though their portion in this
   world is mean, and their lot hard; it is ordered by their kind, wise
   friend for their best good. What though they may be overlooked, yea,
   despised, by men, and are counted the offscouring of all things; their
   names, are enrolled in the most honourable place in heaven; they are
   engraven on the breast of Him who is at the head of the universe, who
   is their Almighty and everlasting friend, and will confess their names
   before the congregated universe. Their life is hid with Christ: in God:
   and when Christ their friend, who is their life, shall appear, then
   shall they also appear with him in glory. Though they are inconceivably
   unworthy guilty, despicable and ill-deserving in themselves, yet their
   friend to whom they are united has dignity and worthiness enough to
   recommend to the highest honours and happiness. Because they love him,
   and have united themselves to him, as their friend and patron, the
   great Father of the universe loves them, and is disposed to bestow on
   them all imaginable favours and honours; and all the angels delight in
   them, and join to serve and honour them. By virtue of their union to
   and interest in this friend and patron, they are counted worthy of
   immensely higher honours and happiness than their most perfect and
   longest continued holiness could have entitled them to. The low, guilty
   and wretched state into which they are fallen by sin, shall on the
   whole be no disadvantage to them, but infinitely to the contrary. All
   this evil shall be turned into the greatest good to them. From this
   infinite depth of guilt and wo, in which they are sunk infinitely below
   the reach of any finite arm, they shall be raised to the top of the
   creation, and be made the highest and happiest of all, next to the most
   blessed and glorious personage to whom they are united, and bear the
   most near and honourable relation. With him they shall dwell forever,
   and be admitted to as great intimacy and familiarity as if he was their
   equal, and immensely more, even as great as they can possibly
   desire--shall constantly have all the tokens and expressions of his
   love they can wish for, and enjoy a dear and sweet friendship with him,
   without interruption, which shall exceed every thing of the kind beyond
   conception, and will grow more and more sweet and transporting through
   boundless duration, eternal ages. In that world of love, where all
   shall swim in this river, this boundless ocean of sacred pleasure and
   delight, they shall have the sweetest, the cream of all; as the
   first-born, they shall inherit a double portion forever.--But I must
   stop; the theme is boundless.

   Am I speaking to any of the friends of Jesus Christ, who love him in
   sincerity, and as chaste virgins are espoused to him? Hail, ye blessed
   of the Lord! Ye are greatly beloved by him, and nothing shall be able
   to separate you from his love. All things are working together for your
   good. Jesus, the beloved of your souls, is at the head of the universe,
   and Is the appointed judge of all. Lift up your heads, and rejoice, tor
   your redemption draweth nigh. You shall soon see him at the head of his
   most glorious kingdom, with all his enemies under his feet. He will
   completely fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness toward you. All
   things are for your sakes, that his abundant grace might, through the
   thanksgiving of many, redound to the glory of God. Be entreated then
   not to faint, but lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble
   knees. Let us not cease to pray for one another, and for all the
   saints, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, may
   give unto us more of the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
   knowledge of him; the eyes of our understanding being enlightened; that
   we may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the
   glory of his inheritance, which he has provided for all the saints.

   III. But who are these most happy persons, the true friends of Jesus
   Christ? Many are doubtless deceiving themselves in this important
   point. They are professing great love to Jesus Christ, and are
   confident that he is their friend, while indeed they know him not, and
   are real enemies to his true character; and will be found at last the
   workers of iniquity, of whom he will be ashamed, and reject them, as
   those whom he never knew. There may be others who, though they are his
   real friends, are often calling their love and friendship to Christ in
   question, and ready sometimes even to conclude against themselves. It
   may therefore be worth while to attend to this question a little, to
   which the subject we are upon naturally leads us.

   Doubtless many readers have had this serious and important question in
   view, through the whole of the preceding discourses. And while we have
   attended to the nature, peculiar circumstances and exercises of this
   friendship, much has been said to give light in this matter, and assist
   persons in determining whether they are in any degree acquainted with
   this divine friendship, or not. But, For the further assistance of
   those who are seriously inquiring whether they are true friends to
   Christ, or not; that the truly sincere may be encouraged and comforted,
   and the presumptuous self-deceiver may be detected and convinced; it
   may be worth while to attend to the following particulars, which this
   subject naturally brings into view.

   I. True friendship to Jesus Christ is not grounded on, and does not
   originate from, a conviction and belief that he loves them and is their
   friend.

   This has been apparent in the whole description that has been given of
   this love and friendship; and is most evident from the reason and
   nature of things. Where one loves, and is a friend to, another, only
   because he is persuaded that the other loves him, there is no real
   benevolence, esteem, complacency or true; friendship in the case. It is
   nothing but self love, called out to exercise in this particular way,
   in which there is not a spark of true friendship; but is a principle
   most directly opposite to it of any in nature. The man is a friend to
   himself, he is wholly bound up in his own private interest, and values
   and seeks nothing else, and takes no complacency and delight in any
   thing else, in no person or things any further than, in his view, it is
   friendly to him, or tends some way to promote his interest; or that
   which lie looks upon so. Such an one, continuing so, is not capable of
   true friendship, to which disinterested benevolence is essential. This
   is so plain a dictate of the common sense and feeling of mankind, that
   it cannot be disputed. If the affection and friendship of any one to us
   is evidently wholly grounded in the kindness he has received from us,
   and our friendship towards him; and all his affection and regard is
   excited and kept up by this consideration only; so that if we should
   leave off to shew kindness to him, or he should suppose that we were
   not his friends, all his affection and friendship would immediately
   cease; if this was evidently all the friendship he has for us, we
   cannot help looking on such an one not to be our true friend. Such sort
   of friendship as this may take place between persons who have not the
   least degree of true benevolence, and who are real enemies to each
   other's true character. And all mankind have joined to pronounce it a
   worthless thing, and not worthy the name of true friendship. And it is
   as distant from true friendship, and as worthless, when exercised
   towards Jesus Christ, as if it was exercised towards us. Yet many are
   here deceiving themselves, and offering that to Christ for his
   acceptance, which if we should offer to any of our fellow men, they
   would despise and abhor it.

   But the true friends of Christ have had their affection and love to him
   excited, and they have commenced his true friends, from a view of his
   true character, exhibited in divine revelation, entirely independent of
   the consideration of his loving and being a friend to them. When his
   character was once opened to their view, and they saw what manner of
   person he was, they were pleased and charmed with him, and their hearts
   became friendly to him in a moment. They did not, neither could they,
   stay till they knew he was their friend, and loved them, before they
   commenced his friends, and gave their hearts to him. No; they could not
   but love him, whether he loved them or no. That this is always true of
   the real friends of Christ, is evident to a demonstration, not only
   from what has been just now observed of the nature of true friendship,
   there being no other such, but that which is founded in a disinterested
   love and affection; but from this plain and infallible truth, viz. that
   we can have no evidence that Christ is our friend, and loves us, until
   it is evident that we are his friends. There is no other possible way
   for any person to know, or have the least ground to think, that Christ
   is his friend, but by first becoming a friend to him. If therefore he
   waits, and neglects to become friendly to Christ, till he has some
   evidence that Christ is more a friend to him than to every other
   person, he never will be a friend to him. We are therefore certain,
   that if there are any friends to Christ in this world, they became so
   antecedent to any evidence which they had that Christ was their friend,
   and loved them: for it is impossible they should have any such evidence
   antecedent to their love to him, and as the ground and spring of it;
   this evidence being always consequent on our love to Christ, and never
   before it. Christ says, "He that loveth me, I will love him; or, I will
   love them that love me." Here we see Christ's love and friendship is
   grounded on a person's love to him, and is the consequence of it;
   therefore the latter cannot be the consequence of the former, and
   grounded on that, And here Christ promises his love and friendship to
   them who love him; therefore, according to this promise, our love to
   him is the only evidence that he is our friend. And there is not one
   promise in the Bible, of Christ's special love and friendship to any
   one, unless he has that character which implies true love to Christ:
   or, they who are not true friends to Christ have no promise made to
   them of Christ's special love and favour; therefore can have no degree
   of evidence of it, while they continue such. They therefore who think
   they have had any token or evidence of Christ's special love to them,
   antecedent to their loving him, or before they become his friends, are
   most certainly deluded. And they whose friendship to Christ is built on
   such a supposition, and has originated wholly from the belief that lie
   was their special friend, are founding all their friendship on a gross
   delusion, and are indeed no true friends to Christ, and need nothing
   but to see the truth, in order to know they are not. And they who will
   not love Christ, and become friends to him, till they first know, or
   believe on good evidence, that he is their special. friend, will never
   be his friends in this world; therefore will certainly remain his
   enemies to all eternity.

   The true friends of Christ love him for what he is in himself; and all
   their friendship to him consists originally and fundamentally in this.
   He has. worthiness and excellency, beauty and charms enough in his
   person and character to win the heart of any one who has the least
   degree of true discerning, and right taste and disposition. If persons
   have no degree of such taste and discerning, all the possible
   manifestations and testimonies of Christ's special love to them would
   not beget the least spark of such a disposition; so would not produce
   the least decree of true friendship: therefore would do no manner of
   good to such an one, but hurt; as it would be the occasion of the
   exercise of the wickedness and lusts of his heart, and leave him really
   a more confirmed enemy to Christ than he was before. But if persons
   have any degree of right taste and discerning implanted in their hearts
   (which is always done in regeneration) they will love and be charmed
   with the beauty and excellence of Christ's character, and commence his
   true friends immediately, before they know, or have the least evidence,
   that he is their friend, or has any special love to them. And it is in
   consequence of their thus loving and cleaving to him., that he
   manifests himself to them as their special Friend and Redeemer. And
   this manifestation is made by the medium of their love to him, which,
   as has been before observed, is in all cases the only evidence that any
   person can have that Christ is indeed his friend. Christ himself has on
   design stated this matter as plain as words can make it. He says, "He
   that loveth me, I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him."

   It is granted that the manifestation and evidence of Christ's special
   love to his true friends will greatly increase their love to him; and
   therefore, in a sense and degree, they love him because he first loved
   them; or, his love to them, manifested in the way just mentioned, does
   render him more dear to them, and greatly increase and sweeten their
   love and friendship for him. But if they had no antecedent love to him,
   grounded upon what he is in himself, such manifestation would not be
   the occasion of any true love, as has been observed. "When therefore a
   sense and manifestation of Christ's love to them is said to be the
   occasion of their love to him, it is supposed that they were already,
   and antecedent to this, his true friends. The more true love and
   friendship we have for any one, grounded on the true worth and
   excellence of his character, the more pleasing will it be to us to be
   beloved by him, and the more will it increase our love and friendship.

   The view of this matter which we have now had is sufficient to
   demonstrate, to every considerate, unprejudiced person, that those
   remarkable words of the apostle John, We love him, because he first
   loved us, cannot mean that our love to Christ originates from a belief
   and sense of his love to us, as the proper cause and reason of it, so
   that men never love him in any other view, or on any other account, and
   our love to him is in proportion to the evidence and manifestation of
   his love to us, so that when this evidence ceases, and we call in
   question his love to us, our love to him ceases, and again rises in
   proportion to our belief and assurance that he is our friend. This is
   the meaning that many have put on them, and earnestly contended for.
   But what has been said is sufficient to shew that they herein contend
   for a love and friendship to Christ which is not true friendship, but
   is perfectly selfish and mercenary, so cannot be that in which true
   Christianity consists. The worst of men will love those that love them,
   without any alteration in their moral character at all. Such a love is
   no virtue, but rather a vice, as it is only the exercise of their
   lusts. And these same men will love Christ, if they can be persuaded to
   believe that Christ loves them, and yet be as destitute of true
   religion, and as vicious, a? ever. And whoever is a friend to Christ
   only in this view, and on this account, has no true religion, and is at
   bottom a real enemy to Christ. The meaning of these words then, "We
   love him because he first loved us," must be, that God's love and
   benevolence to us is the ground and reason of our ever being brought to
   love him, as we never should have been brought to such a temper and
   disposition, but have continued his enemies, had he not, from his
   eternal, electing love, given us a new heart, a heart to love him; so
   that, in this sense, his love to us, which is first, even from
   eternity, is the cause of our love to him. This is a certain truth, and
   these words are as well adapted to express it as any that can be
   thought of. Our Saviour, speaking of the same thing, viz. the love and
   friendship between his disciples and himself, expresses it in different
   words. He says to them, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you;"
   i.e. my previous choice of you to be my disciples and friends has been
   the reason of your becoming my friends and followers, as you never
   would have become my friends, had I not brought it about: so you now
   love me, and are become my friends, because I first loved you, looked
   you up, and called you by my influences and grace. What the Apostle
   plainly means to assert here is, that in the work of redemption, in
   which a reconciliation is brought about between God and man, and a
   mutual love and friendship takes place, God is the first mover, and not
   man. This is the theme he is upon, as appears by the tenth verse:
   "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
   his Son to be a propitiation for our sins." God is first in his love to
   man, by which he has provided a Mediator; and then, by his motion and
   influences, brings men to love him. And thus we are brought into this
   friendship, and love God and the Saviour, not as first moving in the
   affair ourselves, but because God first loved us. The devil knew that
   such a selfish religion is not true religion, but is an argument that a
   man is really a wicked man, and an enemy to God; therefore he said, in
   order to set Job in a bad light, and insinuate, that the character God
   gave of him, as an upright man, did not belong to him; "Doth Job serve
   God for nought?" &c: q.d. "Job is wholly selfish and mercenary in what
   he does, and has no true respect and love to God, nor is really his
   friend: for all the love and service he renders to God is grounded on
   God's love and kindness to him, and the good he gets by it. Therefore
   only take away these tokens of love and goodness, and his love will
   wholly cease, and he will turn an enemy to God." And God implicitly
   grants, that if this was the case with Job, he was not worthy the
   character he had given him; therefore proceeds to put this matter to
   the trial. Wo to the person whose love and friendship to Christ is
   built on no better foundation than this. When the trial comes, he will
   be found wanting, even just such an one as the devil would have him be;
   a real and confirmed enemy to Jesus Christ.

   Let every one, then, who is inquiring whether he is a true friend to
   Christ, or not, see to it that he does not deceive himself here, while
   all his love and affection is only a selfish thing, arising wholly from
   a thought and belief that Christ is his friend, and not consisting in
   any true sense of his worthiness, superlative excellence and beauty.
   The true friends to Christ love and esteem him, are pleased with his
   person. and character, and are friendly and benevolent to him,
   rejoicing in his honour and happiness, independent of his love to them;
   and therefore if he should cast them off forever, and their character
   continue the same, this would not destroy their love to him; but they
   would, notwithstanding this, continue his hearty friends, even under
   the highest tokens of his displeasure; could he do this consistent with
   his true character.

   1. The true friends of Christ are submissive and obedient to him.

   There is no true principle of obedience but love; and just so far as
   this takes place, there is a spirit of obedience. So far as one is a
   true friend to another, he is devoted to his service, and is at his
   beck, especially if he is his superior, and has a right to dictate and
   command. And with what freedom and pleasure do we strive to serve and
   please our clear friends! This is no talk, but a privilege. What
   influence then will true love and friendship to Christ have in this
   respect! with what sweet delight do they devote themselves to Him,
   looking on his service as the greatest privilege and happiness that
   they can conceive of! They long to be all submission and obedience to
   him, from a sense of the sweetness and pleasure of it. As soon as they
   become friends to him, they are reconciled to and pleased with all his
   institutions, commands and ways. They esteem all his precepts
   concerning all things to be perfectly right. They will meditate on his
   precepts, and have respect to all his ways. Yea, they will delight
   themselves in his statutes, and rejoice in the way of his testimonies,
   more then in all riches. They well understand the Psalmist when he
   says, "I opened my mouth, and panted, for I longed for thy
   commandments." They are not disposed to pick and choose for themselves,
   but are ready to sign a blank, and say, "Lord what wilt thou have me to
   do?" "With this disposition they read God's word, desiring to find what
   is that good and perfect: and acceptable will of Christ. They are not
   offended at the cross, or feared at the prospect of sufferings for
   their dear Lord and Master; but are ready to look upon this as a great
   privilege and happiness. Ail this is the natural and even necessary
   attendant of true friendship to Christ. This our dear Lord has
   expressed repeatedly in the strongest terms. His words are, "He that
   hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. If a
   man love me, he will keep my words. Ye are my friends, if ye do
   whatsoever I command you."

   There are many professed friends of Christ who are, found wanting, yea,
   essentially defective, when tried by this plain, infallible rule, which
   is most insisted on of any in the word of God, as the best rule of
   trial. They have, it may be, at times had some uncommon motions and
   affections of soul, as they fondly think, towards Christ: and in these
   they rest as a sure evidence that they are become friends to him. But
   what is the fruit in their life and conversation? Why, it may be truly
   said of them, they profess great love and friendship to Christ, but in
   works they dishonour and deny him. They call him Lord and Master, but
   do not the things that he says: therefore we may be sure they are not
   his friends; that all their affection, love and joy, however high it
   rises, is of a spurious kind, and has nothing of the nature of true
   love to Christ.

   Look well to yourselves in tills point, my friends. Flatter not
   yourselves that you are friends to Christ, unless you are wholly
   devoted to his service, and are, with great exactness and conscientious
   care, labour and watchfulness, attending upon whatsoever he has
   commanded, and avoiding all that he has forbidden, in thought, word and
   deed: at the same time not counting this a task, but a privilege, from
   which you never desire to be released.

SERMON VIII.

   On Christian Friendship.

   Cant. v. 16. This is my beloved, and this is my friend.

   3. IF PERSONS are the true friends of Christ, their obligations to him
   appear exceeding great to them.

   It is the nature of true friendship to operate thus. This above all
   things tends to make persons sensible of the obligations they are under
   to their friend, and to be ready, and even delight, to acknowledge
   them. The more we esteem and love any one, the greater does his
   kindness to us appear, and the more are we affected with it, and,
   consequently, the more sensible shall we be of the obligations we are
   under to him; and the more shall we be pleased and delighted in being
   thus obliged.

   This takes place in the friendship we are now considering, to a degree
   beyond any parallel. No obligations in the universe are so great as
   those of Christ's friends and servants to him. They are enhanced to an
   amazing degree, and become infinite every way. They are enough to fill
   the soul with wonder and astonishment, and swallow up all thought. And
   his friends are not without a sense of this. They feel themselves bound
   to Christ by the strongest ties, which are beyond all expression. He
   has bought them by his own precious blood, and what obligations do they
   acknowledge themselves to be under, to be wholly and forever devoted to
   him, with the utmost strength of their hearts!

   If you are the friends of Christ, this has been often a very affecting
   theme to you. You have felt and acknowledged your obligations to
   Christ, with an ardour of soul inexpressible, and with a great degree
   of sweetness and delight. And you have said, many a time, "What shall I
   render to the Lord and Saviour for all his benefits?" And you have
   found you had no returns to make answerable to the immense obligations
   you are under to him.--This leads to observe,

   4. The friends of Christ never think they have done enough for him, but
   always, in their own view, come vastly short of what they owe to him.

   This is always the attendant of true friendship among men, especially
   where one is a great friend to another who is much his superior every
   way, and to whom he is under great and peculiar obligations. He is not
   afraid of doing too much for his friend; but always comes short of what
   he would be glad to do, being ready to purpose and do more than he
   does. And he is not apt to magnify what he has done, and think he does
   a great deal, as he does it with so much pleasure, and his obligations
   appear so great; but he is disposed to think it little, or even
   nothing; and if his friend appears to take great notice of it, he is
   ready to wonder at it, and think he greatly magnifies it. He thinks he
   is to blame that he has done no more, and is uneasy with himself on
   this account, and wonders that such notice should be taken of what he
   has done.

   But in the case before us, this takes place in a higher degree than in
   any other; as the Christian's friend is so much more worthy and
   excellent than any other, and he is under so much greater obligations
   to him, and his defeats and short comings are so much greater and more
   aggravated than in any other case. All the Christian does, and renders
   to Christ, links into nothing, in his view, and he looks upon it as
   amazing condescension in Christ to take any notice of it, or accept it.
   He can heartily and feelingly espouse the language of a certain great
   friend of Christ, who was once in our world, but is now in heaven with
   him: "What I would, that I do not; and what I would not, that I do." I
   am infinitely in debt to my glorious friend, but pay nothing. All my
   returns I make to him are so little, and so much below the obligations
   I am under, that they are altogether unworthy his notice. O that I
   could give away to him my whole self forever in one pure, constant,
   ardent flame of love. And even this would be so little, worthless a
   gift, that it is great grace and condescension in him to accept it. If
   I was called to the greatest sufferings in his cause, and to lay down
   my life for him, this I should count the greatest privilege; but how
   little would this be towards paying the debt I owe! how little compared
   with what he has done for me!

   There are many professed Christians, who naturally think they do a
   great deal for Christ, and that he is much in debt to them for it;
   while they are really doing little compared with what many others do.
   And the very reason why they have so high an opinion of what they do
   is, because they count Christ's service hard, and at bottom have no
   true love to him. But the true friends of Christ, from the great love
   they have to him, are disposed to look upon all they can do or suffer
   for him as little or nothing.

   5. The friends of Christ are ready to espouse his cause at all times,
   let it cost them what it will.

   This is the nature of true friendship; it will lead persons always to
   appear on the side of their friend, to espouse his cause, and promote
   his interest. Solomon observes, that a friend loveth at all times. This
   is applicable to the case before us: a true friend of Christ loveth at
   all times, is ready to stand up in his cause, and espouse his interest,
   let who will oppose it. He is not ashamed of his friend, and will not
   account his name, estate or his life dear to him, if he is called to
   give any or all of them up, to testify his love to Christ. He is
   tenderly affected and hurt when Christ is slighted and dishonoured, and
   will do all he can to wipe off the reproach. And if Christ must be
   dishonoured and reproached, he is willing to suffer reproach with him;
   and desires not to fare better in the world than Christ and his cause
   do.

   6. The true friends of Christ desire and long to have others become his
   friends.

   Their benevolence to Christ, and to their fellow men, will both
   influence to this. They want all should love and honour Christ, out of
   love and benevolence to him; and they earnestly desire that others may
   enjoy the happiness of this friendship, as friends to them. Under the
   influence of this they are praying for others, that they may be brought
   to know Christ, and so become his real friends and servants. And they
   are taking all the proper ways they can think of to recommend Christ to
   others, both in words and conduct, by holding forth light, and matter
   of conviction of his worth and excellence.

   7. The true friends to Christ know that they are naturally enemies to
   him, and continue to have a great degree of opposition and enmity in
   their hearts to him, even now.

   There are many professed Christians who are Insensible that they are,
   or ever were, in any degree real enemies to Christ. They think mankind
   in general, and themselves in particular, are much misrepresented and
   abused, if any one declares them to be naturally enemies to Christ.
   This, we are obliged to think, is owing to their not being real friends
   to Christ. If they were, they could not be so insensible of that which
   opposes him. It is no wonder that he who is not a friend to Christ
   should be blinded in this matter, and wholly overlook his opposition
   and enmity to Christ; but that a true friend to him should be thus
   blinded is perfectly unaccountable, and even impossible. All sin is
   most direct opposition to Christ, and enmity against him, whether it be
   in us or in others. But the Christian world is full of sin; and all men
   are naturally wholly given to it, and therefore really hate Christ. And
   even his best friends, in this world, have a great degree of
   corruption, and many sinful exercises of heart. And all this is real
   enmity to Christ, it being not the less so because they have a degree
   of love to Christ. Therefore it seems impossible that a friend to
   Christ should be insensible of this.

   When any one has no true love and friendship for another, but greatly
   undervalues, dislikes and hates him, and yet imagines he is his true
   friend, he must of consequence be in a great degree stupid and blind to
   the slight and contempt that is cast upon him, and will naturally think
   he is treated well enough; and may look upon that as an act of respect
   to him, in which really a slight is put upon him, and is an act of
   enmity against his true character. But he who is a true friend to
   another, and esteems, honours and loves him to a great degree, for what
   he is in himself, and in a view of his true character, will be quick to
   discern and feel every slight that is put upon him, and every thing
   that opposes his character. So it is in this case; the true friend of
   Christ knows the whole world lies in wickedness, and that all men are
   naturally in arms against Christ, and are proclaiming their enmity
   against him; that he himself is naturally a rebel and enemy to him; and
   that there is a great degree of the same thing in his heart now, of
   which he mall never be wholly cured, till he is perfectly cured of all
   sin. In this view the friends of Christ loathe and abhor themselves,
   humble themselves before him, and lie in the dust at his feet, judging
   and condemning themselves, acknowledging their own guilt and
   ill-desert, and exceeding vileness and odiousness, and feeling
   themselves wholly without the least excuse. They know that the carnal
   mind, even every thing that is in man naturally, is enmity against
   Christ, and that the friendship of this world Is enmity against him;
   that they are no further friends to Christ than they are new creatures,
   having put off the old man with his lusts, and put on the new man: and,
   O, how do they long for deliverance from this body of sin and death, to
   be perfectly like Christ, and turned into a pure, holy flame of perfect
   love to him!

   8. The true friends of Christ think much of him, and his name is as
   ointment poured forth, having a sweetness and fragrancy, which often
   fills their hearts with an holy warmth and fervour, and sweet, heavenly
   delight.

   Our dearest friends have always a place in our hearts: we are apt to
   have them much in our thoughts: every thing about us, and every
   occurrent, almost, will suggest the idea of them to our minds, which we
   are apt to carry with us wherever we go.

   And surely there is something like this in the friendship we are
   considering. No person has reason to think he is a friend to Christ,
   unless he thinks much of him, and the pleasing idea he has formed of
   him is apt to be present, and is familiar to him.

   The friend of Christ has really more concern with him, than with any
   other person in the universe; and more passes between him and Christ,
   than between any one else. To him his heart naturally goes out, when
   alone, in exercises of love, devotion and prayer; and of him he thinks
   much, even in company; for none can so divert him as to erase the sweet
   idea of his best beloved from his mind. And whatever he does in word or
   deed, he does all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God
   and the Father by him. Christ is in him the hope of glory; and the life
   he lives is a life of faith on the Son of God.

   9. The friends of Christ do trust in him wholly for righteousness and
   strength. They trust in his merit and worthiness only, to recommend
   them so as to find acceptance with the Father of the universe, and to
   all that favour they need. They know they have no worthiness of their
   own, but infinitely the reverse of it; that they are in themselves most
   unworthy, odious and ill-deserving; and they know that Christ has merit
   and worthiness enough to recommend them; and they see wherein it
   consists. Their knowledge of the true character of Christ, and sense of
   his worthiness, excellency and amiableness, in which their love and
   friendship to him consists, is a sufficient foundation for their trust
   in him to recommend them to the offended Lawgiver. They see the reason
   why he is so worthy and acceptable to the Father; and do not wonder
   that he is ready to pardon and shew the greatest favours to those who
   are his friends, and for whom he has undertaken as their friend and
   patron, interposing and employing his merit and worthiness in their
   behalf. They therefore see the safety there is in relying upon him for
   this, however unworthy they are in themselves; that they need nothing
   but to be united to him, so that he shall be their friend, and properly
   espouse their cause, in order to have all the favour they want, and to
   be "accepted in the Beloved." And the higher their love and friendship
   to Christ arises, and the greater sense they have of his excellency and
   Worthiness, the more strongly do they rely upon him for righteousness;
   the more clearly do they see the propriety, wisdom and glory of this
   way of the sinner's finding acceptance with God, and with the more
   cheerfulness and delight do they trust in him, "desiring to be found in
   him, not having their own righteousness, which is of the law, but that
   which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God
   by faith." In short, the more they love Christ, the more fully do they
   see their destitution of all righteousness and worthiness of their own;
   yea, the infinite distance they are from any such thing, even their
   infinite vileness and ill-desert; and the more clearly do they behold
   the sufficiency of his worthiness to recommend them; and the more
   pleased are they with being saved in this way, as the wisest and most
   sweet and excellent of any they can imagine.

   If a person wants a favour of any one, which he has forfeited, and of
   which he is utterly unworthy, having justly incurred his highest
   displeasure; and there is another, a third person, whom he highly
   esteems and loves, and knows he is most worthy and acceptable in his
   eyes whose favour he wants; he will naturally desire that this his
   beloved friend should espouse his cause, and interpose the influence
   and merit he has with the offended person, to procure his pardon and
   favour. And if he knows that this his much esteemed and most dear
   friend has actually undertaken thus to mediate in the behalf of
   offenders, and in this work has done much to please and honour the
   offended, injured person, even enough more than to countervail the
   injury and damage he had sustained; he will naturally rely wholly upon
   his merit and worthiness with the offended person, for that acceptance
   and favour he wants. And his receiving it in this channel, wholly by
   the interposition, merit and worthiness of his highly esteemed and well
   beloved friend, will render it doubly sweet to him, at the same time
   that it will greatly endear to him his very worthy friend. And hence we
   may observe, that it is agreeable not only to the practice of mankind
   in such cases, but to the reason and nature of things, that such a
   friend should, by his merit with the offended person, procure pardon
   and favour to the offender, who applies to him and trusts in him, to do
   such a kind office for him; and that it may be reasonable and proper
   that such a favour should be given him purely out of respect to the
   merit and worthiness of his friend, to whom he is united, and in whom
   he trusts for this, which it would not be proper and wise to grant in
   any other way.

   Thus the friend of Christ sees that "the Lord is well pleased for his
   righteousness sake," and says, with unspeakable satisfaction and
   pleasure, "In the Lord have I righteousness;" yea, with immensely more
   pleasure than the angels have in being accepted in their own
   righteousness. And the honour and glory that the Mediator, their
   dearest friend, has, by thus becoming the righteousness of his people,
   and procuring pardon and acceptance for them, is exceeding satisfactory
   and pleasing to his friends. They are abased and humbled to the lowest
   degree, and made to take their proper place, in a sense of their own
   infinite unworthiness and guilt: Christ, their friend, is exalted, as
   having merit and worthiness with God sufficient to cancel their guilt,
   and recommend them to the greatest dignity and blessedness. And with
   this they are well pleased, and rejoice to take their own place, sink
   down low at the foot of Christ, and to exalt and honour their glorious
   Friend and Redeemer. And in this way they at the same time exalt and
   honour themselves in the highest degree.

   They who are at heart in no degree friendly to Jesus Christ, never thus
   trust in him for righteousness; nor can they be reconciled to this
   method of pardon and salvation. Whatever profession they may make, and
   however orthodox they are in speculation, they do not really understand
   this matter; it is foolishness unto them, and their whole hearts do in
   all their exercises most directly and strongly oppose it; and they are
   at bottom seeking after righteousness, as it were by the works of the
   law. The friends of Christ trust wholly in him also for strength, by
   which they may persevere in love and friendship with him; being
   sensible that they have no sufficiency of their own, and that there is
   not the least ground of dependence on themselves. In this sense, they
   go through this wilderness to the world above, leaning on their
   beloved; knowing that though of themselves they can do nothing, yet
   through Christ strengthening them they can do all things.

   III. Let what has been said on this subject be improved to recommend
   Jesus Christ to all as the best friend, and as a motive to enter into
   friendship with him, and make him their friend without delay.

   You have been attending to the unspeakable privileges and blessedness
   of this friendship; you have had enough laid before you abundantly to
   convince you that this is the most important and happiest friendship in
   the universe; that they are indeed blessed and made happy forever, who
   are true friends to Jesus Christ. They enjoy a much higher degree of
   happiness in this world, than any other persons ever did, or ever can
   do.

   And you are all now invited into this friendship, who have hitherto
   lived strangers to it; you are none of you excluded; but Christ is
   offered to you all in the character of an almighty and most excellent
   friend; and nothing is wanting but the free consent of your hearts to
   give yourselves up to him, in this character, become friends to him,
   cleave to him, and love him, in order to his being your friend. You
   cannot fail of having him your friend but by rejecting the most kind
   offer he makes to you. If therefore any under the gospel perish at last
   for want of an all-sufficient friend, who is able and ready to do all
   for them they can want, even in the most extreme case, and is
   infinitely the best, most sweet and excellent friend in the universe;
   it must be because they have persisted through their whole life in
   refusing his kind offer to be their friend, and pressing invitations,
   urged by the strongest motives imaginable, to choose him as their
   friend.

   All that has been said on this interesting, pleasing subject conspires
   to shew the folly and misery of such. But to all this a few words more
   may be added, in an address to such who have hitherto rejected this
   Heavenly Friend.

   Consider how happy they must be who have entered into this friendship;
   who love, and are beloved by, such an infinitely excellent and amiable
   friend. Much has been said in the preceding discourses to set forth the
   happiness of such. But the particular consideration which is suited to
   lead you to conceive of this matter, is, the happiness of other
   friendships; at least the happiness which men are eagerly seeking and
   pursuing in them.

   The blooming, sprightly youth commonly sets out soon in the eager
   pursuit of happiness, in love and friendship. For this he has the most
   keen taste, and can conceive of no higher enjoyment than this. To love
   and be beloved by a friend which he shall choose out from all the rest
   of mankind, and prefer to all the rest, to enjoy such a friend in the
   most agreeable circumstances, is the height of all felicity in his
   view. And even the hope and prospect of it will give a degree of high
   enjoyment, such as it is, and prompt him to go through almost any
   difficulty and hardship, in order to be united with and enjoy such a
   friend.

   Your observation and experience with respect: to this may serve to
   convince you of the exalted happiness of the friendship I am inviting
   you into. What are all the excellencies and charms, either of body or
   mind, of the most lovely persons on earth, compared with those of Jesus
   Christ! You want nothing but a taste and relish for his beauties, in
   order to lower your relish for all mere human friendships, and to make
   you long for real enjoyment in the most noble and substantial
   friendship; and the highest enjoyment of earthly lovers (to obtain
   which they would be willing to give away all the riches of both the
   Indies) would appear to you to be mean trash; a low, despicable, fading
   nothing. They who, in a high taste for friendship, are pursuing
   happiness in earthly loves, are always disappointed in a greater or
   less degree. Either they never get possession of the beloved object,
   or, if they do, they find not those excellencies they expected, having
   greatly overrated them in their imaginations; or the enjoyment does not
   answer their expectations; and the happiness they find is short-lived,
   and attended with many troubles and undesirable things, and soon dies
   away. And often the short-lived comfort gives place to a keen and
   lasting misery, which leaves the poor creature in absolute despair of
   that happiness which had been expected, and so eagerly fought after.
   But in the friendship now proposed to you, your highest expectations
   shall be immensely outdone. The enjoyment of your friend shall not
   fade, but increase. You will find his beauty and excellency greater
   than you conceived; and that the one half was not told you. You shall
   exist in the bloom and vigour of eternal youth. Your taste for love and
   friendship shall not die, but increase, and be a thousand times as high
   and keen as that of the most passionate, doating earthly lover: and
   this shall be completely satisfied in the enjoyment of your beloved,
   under all imaginable advantages, and with every desirable circumstance,
   while his beauties shall sparkle in your eyes, and more and more charm,
   and fill you with unutterable transports of the most solid and lasting
   joy, and he will give himself wholly to you forever.

   O let them who have a high relish for earthly love and friendship
   improve this to help their conceptions of the happiness of the love and
   friendship now recommended; and let them hence be excited to seek after
   this enjoyment, by choosing Jesus Christ as their friend. Let them know
   that it is only because their taste is vitiated and perverted, that
   they are not pursuing this love with as much eagerness and high
   expectation as the fond youth is hurried on in earthly amours.

   And let the youth, in particular, be invited into this friendship. It
   is pity the morning of your days, the bloom and vigour of life, should
   be spent in the eager pursuit of that which will not profit, but end in
   disappointment and misery. It is pity you should not give yourselves up
   to Jesus Christ, the heavenly friend, in your early days, and let him
   have your first love. He is calling upon you to give your hearts to
   him, in this noble and exalted friendship. You shall find all the
   sweetness in this that you expect, and are pursuing elsewhere, and ten
   thousand times more. And this shall sweeten all other friendships to
   you, that are worthy to be desired and pursued. This will lay a
   foundation for a virtuous, noble friendship with others, which shall
   grow more and more refined and sweet, and shall end in something happy
   and glorious, beyond all our present conceptions.

   Again, consider the base ingratitude and wickedness there is in
   slighting and rejecting the offers of this friendship with Jesus
   Christ, and the dreadful consequence of it. If you do not enjoy all the
   blessings of this friendship, it will be wholly your own fault, and the
   consequence will be unutterable misery. You must answer for the
   wickedness you are guilty of in rejecting Christ, which is in
   proportion to his greatness, worthiness and excellence, his kindness
   and lore, and the happiness you hereby refuse. You are spurning at, and
   trampling upon, the most tender love, of the most worthy and excellent
   personage, who offers to receive you into the embraces of the dearest
   love. And O, what will be the consequence of this! Why, Christ, the
   great and celebrated friend, who now offers to take you into a dear and
   everlasting friendship, and become your most loving friend forever, if
   you will consent to it, will become your peculiar and greatest enemy;
   yea, your implacable enemy forever. He will hate you, and heap
   mischiefs on your head, without the least degree of pity or regard to
   your interest. He will cast you into outer darkness, and tread you down
   in his wrath, and trample you in his fury. His hatred, wrath and
   vengeance towards you will be great and dreadful in proportion to his
   love and kindness to his friends. And all his friends will most
   heartily, join with him in this; and not one of them will exercise the
   least love and pity towards you. All your friendships you are entering
   into and pursuing now, will wholly cease soon, and turn into the most
   tormenting hatred and enmity. The higher your love and friendship with
   others rises, which is consistent with your being enemies to Christ,
   and the more connections you have with inch, the greater enemies and
   plagues will you be to one another forever. And the time will soon come
   when you shall know you have not a friend in the universe, and that you
   yourself know not, nor ever will know, what true friendship means;
   being justly cursed, and given up to an unfriendly heart, full of
   pride, hatred, envy, malice, revenge, cursing and bitterness, in
   consequence of your refusal to enter into a friendship with Jesus
   Christ, Consider how hard and cutting it is now to be hated, and have
   the ill will of others, and find yourself friendless when in calamity
   and distress, and you stand in need of help; and let this teach you a
   little what you must feel if you ever come to the case just described.
   And as you would avoid all this evil, of which we can have but a faint
   idea now, be persuaded to attend to the most kind offer which Christ
   makes to you. O run, fly into his arms, which are now stretched out to
   you, and he will embrace you forever. Are you in the utmost danger of
   sinking into hell, his almighty, everlasting arms shall be underneath
   you, to hold you up, and raise you to the highest heavens. Are you most
   miserable and wretched, run to Christ, and he will deliver you out of
   all trouble, and effectually secure you from all evil; yea, he will
   turn evil into good, and bring the greatest good to you out of the
   greatest calamity and evil. He is, in the most eminent sense, the
   friend and brother who was born for adversity. He is able and ready to
   help in the most adverse, evil case, where no other friend can help and
   deliver. This is his peculiar work, and which is his glory." He is
   anointed to preach the gospel to the poor, to bind up the broken
   hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight
   to the blind; to set at liberty those that are bruised, to comfort all
   that mourn, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for
   mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.

   O, how much do you want such a friend as this I How miserable must you
   be without him! What a comfort will such a friend be in the various
   calamities in this life! His name is as a strong tower: the righteous,
   his true friends, run into it, and are safe. How much will you want
   such a friend, when you come to die! one who has conquered death, and
   taken away his sting, and turned him into a friend to his people: and
   over such the second death shall have no power. What have you to object
   against entering into this friendship without delay? Have you any
   objections against Christ, as not being such an one as you want and
   desire? O, let not one of you say so! How shall we bear to have our
   dearest and most excellent friend thus spoken against, and set at
   nought! O ye friends of Christ, do not your hearts bleed when your best
   beloved friend is thus contemned and wounded! And do you not pity these
   poor, deluded creatures, who are thus abusing the kindest friend of
   sinners, to their own eternal ruin! Surely this is the language of your
   hearts, O sinners! You have a thousand objections against him. He has
   in your eyes no form nor comeliness, no beauty, that you should desire
   him; therefore he is despised and rejected by you.

   Or do you object against yourselves, as too mean, guilty and unworthy
   to be received and loved by such a friend, so that it would be
   presumption in you to think of entering into such a near union and
   friendship with him? This objection is altogether groundless: was it
   not so, he never would have admitted one of the fallen race into this
   happy, high and noble friendship; for this objection, if it were one,
   lies with infinite weight and strength against them all. Do you find
   that Christ has any where made this objection against any, in his word?
   Surely no! so far from this, that he has done and said every thing he
   possibly could, to shew that this is not the least objection with him,
   and never did, nor ever will, make it against the most vile, guilty
   wretch among mankind, who is willing to be his friend, and chooses him
   for his friend and redeemer. Your guilt, vileness and misery will be
   many ways an advantage to this peculiar friendship, as has been shewn;
   and will be so far from being a dishonour to this glorious Friend of
   sinners, though be take you into the nearest and dearest relation and
   friendship with himself, that it will turn greatly to his honour and
   glory. Let this then rather be an argument with you to give yourselves
   up to him without delay, as your almighty, wonderful, excellent friend.

   IV. Let the professed friends of Jesus Christ be hence led seriously to
   consider their distinguishing privileges, and high and peculiar
   obligations. Your profession and calling is a holy, high and heavenly
   one indeed. How amazingly dreadful to be found at last, after all your
   profession and hopes, those to whom Christ will say, "I never knew you:
   Depart from mc, ye workers of iniquity!" O give all diligence to make
   your calling and election sure. Cleave to this infinitely excellent and
   glorious friend with your whole hearts, and in all your ways. O love
   him, and he will love you; he will manifest himself unto you, in all
   the wonders of his love and grace; he will come unto you, and take up
   his abode with you. Shall the friends of Christ suffer themselves to
   get at a distance from him, and let their hearts sink down into a great
   degree of indifference and coldness towards him I Shall they cleave and
   bow down to some other friend, which courts their affections! Shall
   they turn away from him, and seek to make friendship with this world,
   which is enmity against Christ? If there are any such, they may with
   great propriety be addressed in the words of Absalom to Hushai: "Is
   this thy kindness to thy friend! Why wentest thou not with thy friend?"
   What fault have you found in him, that you treat him so? Are you not,
   in a sense, betraying him into the hands of his enemies? Shall he be
   thus wounded in the house of his professed friends!

   Oh hearken to his sweet and charming voice, while he calls to you in
   such melting language as this: "Look unto me, my spouse, from the
   lion's dens, from the mountains of the leopards. Return unto me, for I
   am married unto you. Hearken, O daughter, and incline thine ear; forget
   also thine own people, and thy father's house; so shall the king
   greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him."
   O, if you have a spark of true love and friendship for him, how can you
   forbear saying, and resolving with your whole heart, "I will go and
   return to my first husband, for then it was better with me than now."
   Take with you words, and turn to the Lord, your Friend and Redeemer:
   say unto him, "Take away all our iniquity, and receive us graciously
   into thy favour, and the most kind embraces of thy love: so will we
   render thee our whole souls in the most ardent love, gratitude and
   praise." He will then heal your backslidings, and love you freely.

   Let the dear friends of Christ hold fall their profession without
   wavering, and follow on to know the Lord. Cleave to him, let it cost
   you what it will; and hold yourselves in readiness to part with all,
   even your own lives, for him. If ye suffer in his cause, as his friends
   and followers, happy are ye. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you,
   and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for
   his sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in
   heaven, if there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort
   of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
   fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the same love to
   Christ and to one another. If ye be indeed risen with Christ, seek
   those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of
   God. Sec your affection on things above, not on things on the earth:
   and when Christ, the chief shepherd and your friend, shall appear, you
   shall appear with him in glory; and ye shall receive a crown of
   everlasting glory, and reign with him in his kingdom forever. Amen.

SERMON IX.

    WRITTEN IN THE YEAR I798.

   Phil. ii. 12, 13. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling:
   for it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to de, of his good
   pleasure.

   IT is proposed to explain, illustrate and improve this passage of holy
   scripture with a view to promote the knowledge and practice of those
   exercises and duties in which real Christianity consists, and by which
   it is distinguished from all counterfeits.

   In order to this, the following things must be attended to, and with
   care distinctly examined.

   I. What is meant by Christians working out their own salvation, and in
   what this work consists.

   II. What is meant by doing this with fear and trembling.

   III. What is to be understood by God's working in them, both to will
   and to do, of his good pleasure.

   IV. Wherein, and in what respects, this affords a reason and motive to
   enforce the foregoing exhortation, expressed by the particle For, by
   which the sentence is introduced: For it is God who worketh in you, &c.

   V. Improve the subject to practical purposes.

   I. We are to consider and shew what is intended and implied in
   Christians working out their own salvation. For it must be observed,
   and kept in mind, while attending to this subject, that the Apostle is
   here, and in the whole of this epistle, addressing none but those whom
   he considers to be real Christians, "saints in Christ Jesus;" [chap. i.
   verse 1;] in whom God had begun a good work, which he would perform
   until the day of Jesus Christ; [v. 6;] who not only believed on Christ,
   but also suffered for his sake, [v. 29,] and had always obeyed Christ
   since they first believed: [chap. ii. 12.]

   By salvation we are to understand, eternal life, which consists in
   deliverance from sin and all evil, and being made perfectly holy and
   happy in the enjoyment and favour of God in his eternal kingdom. This
   is the hope which Christians are called by Christ to consider and
   pursue; the prize set up before them, for which they are commanded to
   run.

   The Christian worketh out this as his own salvation, by avoiding and
   renouncing every thing which is in the way of obtaining it, and would
   effectually prevent it, if it were not given up and rejected; by
   surmounting and overcoming all the opposition and difficulties which
   would retard and obstruct him in his work; by his faithfully performing
   all those exercises, duties and works which are included in the life of
   a Christian, and necessary in order to his salvation.

   When a person is truly converted, and becomes a real Christian, a true
   disciple of Christ, he then begins this great work, which is not
   finished till he leaves this state of trial, and passes into the unseen
   world by death. This is the most noble and important work, as well as
   the greatest and most difficult, in which any of the children of men
   can engage; and, as will appear before we have finished the subject,
   infinitely too great, and altogether impossible, to be performed by
   fallen man, unless strengthened and carried through it by the power and
   grace of the mighty Redeemer.

   This work of Christians is represented and described in the scripture
   by a variety of expressions and metaphors, too many to be here
   particularly enumerated. It will be sufficient for the present purpose
   to mention the following.

   Our Saviour speaks of this work in the following words: "And he said
   unto them all. if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and
   take up his cross daily, and follow me." The apostle Paul describes
   this work of a Christian by telling how he worked out his own
   salvation: "And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a
   conscience void of offence, toward God and toward men. I follow after,
   that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended by Christ
   Jesus, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do,
   forgetting the things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those
   things which are before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the
   high calling of God in Christ Jesus. I have, fought a good fight, I
   have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is
   laid up for me a crown of righteousness."

   Jesus Christ represents this work by a warfare, in which the soldiers
   follow their general to battles and. lieges, in which they resolutely
   press forward to conquest. He says, "the kingdom of heaven suffereth
   violence, and the violent take it by force." And this is repeatedly
   represented by the same thing in the Revelation, where he often
   promises salvation to him who overcometh.

   The apostle Paul represents the work of a Christian by those who strive
   for the mastery over those who opposed and fought against them; and who
   ran in a race, in order to obtain a crown, in the midst of a number of
   competitors: "Know ye not that they who run in a race run all, but one
   receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man who
   striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do this
   to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible." And he
   describes the same work in the following passages: "God will render to
   every man according to his deeds: to them who by patient continuance in
   well-doing seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life.
   Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always
   abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
   labour is not in vain in the Lord. But thou, O man of God, flee these
   things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
   patience, meekness. Fight the good sight of faith, lay hold on eternal
   life."

   But, in order to give a more particular and full description of this
   work, and shew what is implied in it, that every one may be in some
   measure sensible of the greatness and difficulty of it, this subject
   requires yet further attention, and more clear illustration from what
   is said of it in the holy scripture. This will be attempted under the
   following heads.

   First. In working out their own salvation persons must avoid, forsake
   and renounce every way or practice of known and allowed sin.

   The scripture teaches us that the allowed practice of any one way of
   known sin is not the way to heaven, but will certainly exclude men from
   salvation, though they should avoid all other ways of sinning, and
   whatever pains they may take in doing many things, and though they may
   make a high profession of godliness, and appear to have a great
   religious zeal. The apostle John says, "Whosoever abideth in him (that
   is in Christ) sinneth not: whosoever sinneth, hath not seen him,
   neither known him. He that committeth sin is of the devil. Whosoever is
   born of God doth not commit sin." He does not mean that he does in no
   sense sin, and is perfectly free from all sin; for this would be a
   direct contradiction to what he had before asserted, viz. "If we say we
   have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." By
   sinning and committing sin is therefore meant, living in the allowed
   practice of any known sin, or omission of any known duty. "They who are
   Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts." The
   gospel teaches them to, deny all ungodliness, and every worldly lust,
   as the only way to obtain salvation. They who are working out their own
   salvation "are undefiled in their way, they do no iniquity, and have
   respect to all God's commandments."

   They must not only avoid all grossly sinful anions, and live what is
   called a sober and regular life, but they must so govern their tongues
   as carefully to avoid every sinful and even idle word. The command is,
   "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which
   is good, to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the
   hearers:" [Eph. iv. 29.] And it is declared by the highest authority,
   that "for every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account
   thereof in the day of judgment:" [Matth. xii. 36.] And an apostle says,
   "If any man seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, this
   man's religion is vain:" [Jam. i. 26.]

   And they must watch against, avoid and suppress all sinful, vain and
   idle thoughts and imaginations in their own hearts. They mud keep their
   hearts with all diligence, and not suffer any vain thoughts to lodge
   within them. They must oppose, fight against and mortify every lust,
   every sinful motion, disposition or inclination in their heart, and not
   indulge any vain imaginations. The heart is the feat and fountain of
   every thing which is sinful. Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,
   and every sin which is brought forth into practice, in words and
   actions. All moral evil which is or has been in the world originates in
   the heart. The Christian therefore has a constant, great and difficult
   work to do in keeping his own heart, in watching against and striving
   to suppress every thought and motion which is contrary to the holy law
   of God, which has a primary respect to the heart, and, by requiring
   every thought and exercise of it to be holy, forbids every motion and
   thought which is not conformable to this holy law.

   Under this head it will be needful to be more particular.

   I. All selfish, covetous thoughts and affections must be opposed and
   suppressed. A selfish disposition, and all selfish thoughts, are
   covetousness, in the most proper and extensive sense of the word. And
   this disposition of the heart is the root and source of all sin, or of
   every thing wrong in the hearts and lives of men, or of all that is
   forbidden in the law of God. Therefore St. Paul speaks of covetousness
   as comprehending all sin, which is forbidden in the law of God, in the
   following words: "I had not known sin but by the law: for I had not
   known lust except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet;" [Rom. vii.
   7.] It hence appears that a covetous spirit is directly opposed to what
   the law of God requires; and this with the fruits of it is all that is
   forbidden. Selfishness seeks her own wholly, and nothing else; and
   therefore is directly contrary to that holy, disinterested benevolent
   love, which the law of God requires, and which the Apostle says
   "seeketh not her own." Man is naturally wholly under the power of this
   selfishness in all his thoughts and actions; and the Christian has as
   much of this in his heart, as he has of sin; and to be delivered from
   every degree of selfish thoughts and affections, will complete his
   salvation. Therefore, in working out his own salvation, he must seek
   deliverance from this giant, selfishness, and watch and oppose all the
   motions of it, which will intrude itself and mix with every thought and
   exercise of the heart, and strive for the dominion, and that in a
   secret and unperceived way, putting on the appearance of benevolence
   and goodness, not to be discovered and detected but by the discerning
   mind, which is constantly on the watch against it.

   This selfishness implies all other evil thoughts, as it is the root of
   all sin, as has been observed; but as these evil thoughts are ranked
   under different names, as they respect: diverse objects, and produce a
   variety of dissimilar actions, it is proper to consider them under
   distinct heads according to their particular names, in order to give a
   more clear and full view of the thoughts and affections which the
   Christian must oppose and mortify, in order to work out his own
   salvation.

   2. Christians must watch against and oppose all proud thoughts, or the
   pride of their own hearts, would they work out their own salvation.
   Pride is selfishness, or a fruit of it, which consists in a disposition
   to exalt self, and induces persons to think more highly of themselves
   than they ought to think. Against such thoughts the apostle Paul
   cautions Christians, and commands them to suppress and extinguish them:
   "I say to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more
   highly than he ought to think:" [Rom. xii. 3.] Our Saviour frequently
   inculcated the necessity of mortifying pride, and putting on humility,
   in order to be saved. He repeatedly said that he who exalteth himself
   shall be abased, and he who humbleth himself shall be exalted. The
   apostles commanded men to humble themselves in the light of God, as the
   only way to favour, and directed Christians to be clothed with
   humility.

   Fallen man is naturally under the dominion of selfishness and pride. He
   is exceeding proud; by which all his thoughts, words and actions are
   governed, even when lie puts on the appearance and pretence of
   humility. This his pride is most unreasonable, and the source of
   constant unhappiness; while there is the highest reason for the deepest
   humiliation, in a view and sense of the infinite odiousness of his
   character and conduct, and his unspeakable guilt and misery, being the
   object of the high displeasure and awful curse of his Maker. But it is
   always true that the more reason men have for humility, and the more
   unreasonable their pride is, their pride is proportionably greater, and
   their hearts are more strongly opposed to humbling themselves. It is
   the nature of pride to hide itself from the person who has it; and he
   who has the most of it is the farthest from being sensible that he has
   any pride. And he only sees his own pride in any degree of true light
   in whose heart the power of it so far broken as to exercise a degree of
   true humility; which is true of every Christian. And even he is far
   from seeing the whole of his pride, and it often deceives him. It
   dwells in it great measure unseen in his heart; and it mixes itself
   with all his thoughts, and is gratified in words and actions, while it
   is not directly perceived, and is called, it may be, by some good name,
   and even looked upon to he real humility.

   Pride has different objects, and supports and exercises itself in ways
   and by means innumerable. It is exercised towards God, so far as he
   comes into view, in mean, degrading thoughts of the Most High, and high
   and exalting thoughts of self; in haughty stubbornness to his
   authority, and disobedience to his law; in setting a high value on his
   own exercises, which he calls religious, so as to be confident they are
   highly pleasing to his Maker, &c. &c. It is exercised, as it respects
   men and himself, in a manner and ways too many to be enumerated here.

   The gospel is levelled directly against the pride of man, and is
   calculated to exalt God, and abase man; so that none but those who
   humble themselves in the sight of the Lord can approve of the way of
   salvation by Christ, or go one step in it. Every true Christian has
   thus humbled himself; so that the dominion of pride is broken in his
   heart. He has come to Christ:. and taken his yoke upon himself, and
   learned of him who is meek and lowly in heart; and walks humbly with
   God, and before men, in a view and sense of his own vile, odious
   character, his unworthiness, littleness and ill-desert before God, and
   his absolute dependence on him, of whom he has the highest, most
   exalted and honourable thou2:hts. He delights to abase himself, and
   exult the Lord, trusting wholly to the atonement and righteousness of
   the Redeemer for pardon and acceptance with God. But the Christian is
   far from deliverance from all pride. He has a degree of true humility,
   and in the light of this discovers his own pride, as he never did
   before, which appears to him to be exceeding odious; and the many
   instances of the exercise of it, which he sees in his own heart and
   practice, are made the occasion of promoting his humility, and of
   humbling him in his own eyes. And it requires constant watchfulness and
   exertion of a Christian to fight against, suppress and mortify the
   pride of his own heart, in which he is working out his own salvation;
   for he cannot be saved in any other way, nor until all his pride be
   slain, and he is completely delivered from it.

   All this is illustrated in the instance of king Hezekiah. He was a good
   man, and had been truly humbled; and resolved to walk softly and humbly
   all his days. But on a certain occasion he was led astray by his own
   pride and vanity of mind, which was not perceived by him in the time of
   his gratifying it. His sinful heart deceived him, and was lifted up in
   pride. But when this was discovered to him, he humbled himself for the
   pride of his heart; as it proved the occasion of his seeing more
   clearly than before all that was in his depraved heart: [see 2 Chron,
   xxxii. 25, 26, 31; Isai. xxxviii. 15.]

   3. The Christian, in working out his own salvation, has to watch
   against all anger, wrath, bitterness, envy, and malevolence, even in
   the thoughts and motions of his heart. All these are implied in
   selfishness and pride, and are the genuine offspring and fruit of those
   evil dispositions, which, being indulged and gratified, produce all the
   angry clamours, contentions, fightings, wars, murders, and the various
   kinds of injuries, unrighteousness and oppressions, which take place
   among mankind. The Christian, from the remaining depravity of his
   heart, and the many, various and daily temptations, injuries and
   provocations, is in constant danger of having some or all of these evil
   thoughts and motions rise in his heart, and of indulging them in a
   sinful degree. He must therefore keep up a continual watch and fight
   against all these; constantly endeavouring to guard himself against
   them, that he may avoid or suppress them in their first motions, and
   prevent their breaking forth into words and actions. And without this
   he cannot work out his own salvation. In order to be saved he must
   mortify all these, and endeavour to cultivate an unruffled, calm,
   patient, meek and quiet spirit, and live in the exercise of that
   benevolence of heart which is contrary to anger, wrath, envy and
   malice, and will suppress and root them out. The apostle James
   therefore says to professing Christians, "If ye have bitter envying and
   strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. This
   wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish:"
   [Jam. 3. 14, 15.] And the apostle Paul says to such, "Let all
   bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be
   put away from you, with all malice:" [Eph. 4. 31.]

   4. Would Christians work out their own salvation, they must not
   indulge, but avoid and suppress, a worldly disposition and affections.
   All men are naturally of the earth and earthly. They love the world,
   and seek a worldly good as their portion: they set their hearts and
   affections on the things of this world: they speak of the world, and
   therefore think much of it, and take their greatest and only pleasure
   in the pursuits and enjoyments of this world. The Christian is no
   longer of this world, but has renounced it as his portion, and chosen
   that which is infinitely better. But as he has still a degree of a
   worldly disposition, and is surrounded with worldly objects, and must
   have much concern with them, they are constantly courting his
   affection, he is continually in danger of being led astray, and setting
   his affection on things on the earth. It therefore requires constant
   care, watchfulness and exertion in order to guard against, and suppress
   and mortify, all worldly affection, in the exercise of that faith which
   overcometh the world, and leads the soul to set its whole affection on
   things which are above, and not on things on the earthy and to keep the
   heart from a sinful love of the world and the things of the world.
   Salvation is to be obtained in no other way but this, by which
   Christians are more and more weaned from this world, and have their
   conversation in heaven. The cares of this world, and the deceitfulness
   of riches and the pleasures of this life, being indulged, choke the
   word, and it becometh unfruitful. Therefore the Christian in working
   out his own salvation must follow the direction of Jesus Christ, who
   said to his disciples, "Take heed to yourselves, watch and pray always,
   lest, at any time, your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and
   drunkenness, and the cares of this life:" [Luke xxi. 34, 36.}

   5. The Christian's working out his own salvation implies a keeping in
   subjection and mortifying all inordinate bodily sensual appetites and
   lusts. These appetites are given to men to answer good and important
   purposes, while in the body in this world: but become a temptation to
   innumerable indulgences, which are hurtful and criminal, and are
   inconsistent with the gospel salvation; for they who live after the
   flesh shall die. In this respect therefore every Christian must crucify
   the flesh with the affections and lusts, and mortify their members
   which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate
   affection, and evil concupiscence. They must keep under their bodies,
   and bring them into subjection, as the only way to escape destruction.
   They must avoid the practice of gluttony, rioting and drunkenness, and
   all chambering and wantonness; and make no provision for the flesh, to
   fulfil the lusts thereof; but purge themselves from all these, that
   they may be vessels unto honour, sanctified and meet for their Master's
   use; knowing that their bodies are temples of the Holy Ghost.

   Thus, to keep the body under, and regulate and govern all the
   inclinations and appetites of it, and occasioned by it, requires great
   and constant care and watchfulness, and strong resolution and fortitude
   of mind, and is no small part of the work of a Christian.

   6. The Christian cannot work out his own salvation unless he crosses
   and strives against an indolent, slothful disposition, which is natural
   to man, and prevalent in him with respect to all those things and
   actions which respect his salvation, and are necessary in order to it.
   Hence have been invented innumerable excuses and pleas in favour of
   sitting still, and neglecting those exertions and duties which are
   necessary to be performed in order to salvation, which are too many to
   be mentioned here. Christians are exposed to be infested and retarded
   in their work, by giving way to this slothful disposition, which is
   most contrary to the work they have to do. This requires their whole
   time, and constant zealous exertions, in which they must not be
   slothful, but fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. The Christian must
   therefore improve every opportunity, and all his advantages, diligently
   working while his day lasts. To sit still in indolence and sloth, is
   really to go backwards. In doing this work the Christian must do as the
   apostle Paul did; he attended to this one business; forgetting those
   things which were behind, i.e., his former indolence in, and deviations
   from, the way of truth, he reached forth to those things which were
   before, he pressed toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling
   of God in Christ Jesus.

   7. The work of a Christian consists much in watching and guarding
   against, suppressing and overcoming, the unbelief of his heart, and all
   unbelieving thoughts.

   Faith is necessary to salvation; and they who are saved live by faith,
   and persevere in believing to the saving of their souls. The Israelites
   were excluded from entering into the land of Canaan by their unbelief;
   and the scripture teaches us that unbelief under the gospel will as
   effectually exclude men from heaven: "He who believeth not shall not
   see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him, and he shall be damned."

   Believing and unbelief, as it respects divine revelation or the gospel,
   do not mean merely the speculative judgment or conclusion of mind
   respecting the truth or falsehood of the gospel, or of any particular
   doctrines or facts which relate to invisible things. Two persons may be
   convinced in their judgment that there is good evidence that the gospel
   is from heaven, and agree in their speculative sentiments in the
   doctrines which are revealed; and yet one of them may be a true
   believer, in the scriptural sense of believing, and the other an
   unbeliever. This will be according to the disposition and exercises of
   their hearts, with respect to the gospel, and the truths which it
   contains. If the heart of one of them has no relish for these truths,
   and love to them, but dislikes and is displeased with them, so that
   they are not cordially embraced as good and excellent, he has no true
   discerning respecting them, and does not see them to be what they
   really are, and is not a believer, in the scripture and proper sense of
   believing. The other has such a taste and disposition of mind, that he
   relishes these truths, and receives them with cordial approbation and
   love. He sees them in a light of which the other has no apprehension or
   idea, and he feels them to be great and important realities, true,
   excellent and good; and they have such an influence and power on his
   heart as to excite strong affections, and govern him in all his
   exercises and conduct. This is a true believer. His faith is as
   different from that of the former, as light is from darkness; as
   powerful sensibility of heart, with strong exercises of affection and
   love, are from insensibility and hardness of heart, and real dislike of
   the truth, and aversion from it.

   True faith, or a real belief of the truths of the gospel, is of a moral
   nature, and therefore has its foundation and seat in the heart; so that
   exercise of heart is necessarily implied in it, and essential to it;
   for every thing of a moral nature belongs to the heart, and that in
   which no disposition or exercise of the heart is implied, has nothing
   of a moral nature, and is neither good nor evil in a moral sense, i.e.
   neither virtue nor vice, which is true of every thing in the mind which
   consists in mere speculation. Therefore we find that believing and
   unbelief, as they respect the gospel, are represented in scripture as
   belonging to the heart, and an exercise of that: "With the heart man
   believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made
   unto salvation. If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.
   Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
   unbelief, in departing from the living God."

   It appears from the passage of scripture last mentioned, not only that
   unbelief belongs to the heart, and, being seated there, is moral evil;
   but that professing Christians are so exposed to the influence of an
   unbelieving heart, that it concerns them to take heed to themselves,
   and be on their watch and guard against the prevalency of this evil in
   their hearts. And indeed all true Christians have as much of this
   unbelief in their hearts as they have of moral depravity or sin. Their
   faith is comparatively small, and as a grain of mustard seed. It does
   exist and increases so far as their hearts are purified, and they grow
   in grace. Yet they are more sensible of the awful degree of unbelief in
   their hearts, than any other persons are or can be, and see the evil
   nature and hatefulness of it.

   This unbelief does not consist so much in speculatively questioning the
   truth of divine revelation, and doubting of the truths contained in it,
   as in the want of sensibly feeling these truths in their reality,
   excellence and importance, and not being properly affected with them.
   All this is unbelief, which no conviction which is merely speculative,
   or any light and evidence which can be offered, by any external means
   and revelation or instructions, will remove, as it is properly hardness
   of heart. But it may, and often does, prejudice and blind the
   speculative understanding, so as at least to weaken the evidence of
   truth in speculation, and occasion speculative doubts about it; and is
   the cause of all that unbelief in speculation which takes place in the
   Christian world; this being not for want of external light and matter
   of conviction, but from the blindness and moral disorders of the heart.

   The true Christian is sensible of this, and that he has that
   insensibility of heart to divine truth, and that darkness and
   blindness, which is not owing to any want of light and evidence which
   is set before him, but to the stupidity, hardness and moral depravity
   of his heart, which will resist the greatest light and matter of
   conviction that can be set before him, and the strongest mere
   speculative conviction of his judgment, and would lead to renounce in
   speculation all the evidence of the truth of divine revelation, were he
   given up of God to the power and prevalence of a reprobate mind; and
   that it is to be ascribed to divine restraints, or to the grace of God
   shining in his heart, and giving him the light of the knowledge of the
   glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, that he has any degree of
   true faith, and has not abandoned himself to total infidelity.

   His remaining unbelief appears to him, especially at times, to be so
   great and overbearing, that it is very grievous, and as a heavy burden
   sinks him down, as an unspeakable calamity, and exceeding criminal.
   Against this he has to watch, strive and pray continually, and he can
   work out his salvation in no other way. His constant petition is,
   "Lord, deliver me from this evil heart of unbelief. Lord, I do believe;
   help thou my unbelief, and increase my faith. Give me that faith which
   is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not
   seen. May I never draw back to perdition, but believe to the saving of
   my soul."

   8. The Christian cannot work out his own salvation without resisting
   the devil, by watching against and opposing his influence and the evil
   thoughts suggested by him.

   The devil works in the hearts of men by the lusts, depraved
   propensities and evil thoughts which have been mentioned. He is
   represented in scripture as taking the advantage of the depravity of
   man to suggest evil thoughts, and excite and strengthen the lusts of
   the heart, and to blind the minds of all them who do not believe; to
   watch and exert all his cunning to deceive and destroy them.
   Unregenerate, wicked persons are represented to be wholly under his
   power, in whom he powerfully worketh, they being in his snare, and led
   captive by him at his will. And in order to persons being converted and
   becoming Christians, this strong enemy must be dispossessed of their
   hearts, by Christ, and they turned from the power of Satan unto God.
   And though Christians are so far delivered from the power of the devil,
   and out of his reach, that he cannot destroy or really hurt them in the
   end; and he who is born of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one
   toucheth him not; that is, is not able to destroy or hurt them, by
   leading them to sin the sin unto death, or to live in a course of sin;
   yet they are not out of the reach of his temptations and assaults, so
   long as they are sanctified but in part, and live in this state of
   imperfection and depravity. Satan provoked king David to number the
   people; and our Saviour said to Peter, "Behold, Satan hath desired to
   have you, that he may sift you as wheat." The apostle Paul was attended
   with a temptation which was the messenger of Satan to buffet him. And
   even Jesus Christ, who had no depravity to give the devil an advantage,
   was assaulted and tempted by him. The apostle Peter directs Christians
   to consider the devil as their adversary, as a roaring lion, walking
   about seeking whom he may devour. The apostle Paul, speaking in the
   name of all Christians, says, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
   but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
   darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places;"
   and directs Christians to take to themselves the whole armour of God,
   that they may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil; and goes
   on to address them in the following words: "Stand, therefore, having
   your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of
   righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of
   peace; above [or over] all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye
   shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take
   the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word
   of God: praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,
   and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all
   saints." [Eph. vi. 10, 18.]

   In these words great and constant work is prescribed to Christians in
   resisting the devil, and standing their ground against all his wiles
   and assaults; a conflict too great and mighty for all but those who are
   strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; yet necessary in
   working out their own salvation. The apostles James and Peter exhort
   Christians to this same work in the words following: "Resist the devil,
   and he will flee from you. Be sober, be vigilant; because your
   adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he
   may devour: whom resist, stedfast in the faith."

   There are some who profess to receive the Bible as a revelation from
   God, who doubt whether there be any devil, or invisible spirits who are
   enemies to Christ, and seek the destruction of men. But surely they
   must be very inattentive to the Bible who can doubt of this. The real
   Christian finds the truth of this so abundantly asserted, that he
   cannot doubt it: and his own experience, if properly attended to, will
   confirm him in this. He will find many motions and suggestions in his
   own mind, which, from the kind of them, and the manner in which they
   take place, are evidently from the agency of Satan. And he is warranted
   from scripture to consider the devil as having a hand and agency in all
   the foolish imaginations, evil thoughts and motions of his heart, and
   in all sin which he sees in others; especially their opposition to
   Christ and the gospel, and unrighteousness and violence towards men;
   for he is deceiving the whole world, and works in all the children of
   disobedience, and is attempting to stir up all the corruption which is
   in the hearts of good men. Therefore, while Christians are watching
   against and opposing all their own evil propensities, and acting
   against and endeavouring to suppress and counteract the sinful courses
   of others, they are really resisting the devil, while they consider
   themselves and others as criminal, for every evil motion in their
   hearts, and all wrong conduct, as if there were no devil to tempt them.

   However great, difficult and of long continuance this work of resisting
   the devil is, every Christian must go through it, and overcome, in
   order to obtain heaven. The Christian is in himself wholly unequal to
   it, but by Christ strengthening him he may go through it all. The
   Christian must do the work, while in order to it he must be
   strengthened by the power and grace of Christ, by which he becomes
   strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. The Christian has no
   reason to desire that Christ should take this work out of his hands,
   and resist and conquer the devil and his lusts without the agency of
   the Christian; but ought to consider it as a great privilege to be
   obliged to do the work himself, and conquer, in the strength and power
   of the Redeemer.

SERMON X.

   The same Subject continued.

   Phil. ii. 12, 13. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
   For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good
   pleasure.

   IT has been attempted to shew in the preceding discourse, though in an
   imperfect, defective manner and degree, what the Christian has to
   oppose, suppress, mortify, and overcome, in working out his own
   salvation. This may be called the negative part of his work, consisting
   in renouncing and departing from evil; and is all comprehended in the
   apostolic injunction: "That ye put off, concerning the former
   conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful
   lusts:" [Eph. iv. 22.]

   Secondly. We come now to consider the positive part of that work in
   doing which Christians work out their own salvation, which is summarily
   expressed in the following words: "And that ye put on the new man,
   which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."

   This implies much, and consists in a constant, careful endeavour to
   conform to and obey the divine commands in heart and life, to live
   soberly, righteously and godly in all things to the end of life. This
   may be divided into two branches, viz. the duties of which God is the
   more direct object, and those which more immediately respect man.

   To God they owe their whole selves, and all they can do. They must love
   him with all their heart, soul, strength and mind. This implies a
   variety of strong, constant exercises of heart towards him, as he is
   revealed in three persons, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; especially
   as he has appeared God manifest in the flesh, in the character of the
   Son of God, and Saviour of the world, exhibited in his words, and works
   of obedience and suffering, his death, resurrection from the dead,
   ascension to heaven, and reigning gloriously there; and in his revealed
   future designs and works.

   They must believe in God and in Jesus Christ, that he is, and that he
   is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him. They must attend to,
   believe and realize his being and whole character as he is revealed in
   the Bible, with all the important and leading truths which are
   contained in it, setting God always before their eyes, and trusting in
   Christ for pardon and complete redemption, which implies all they want
   or can desire, diligently seeking the divine favour through him, or for
   his sake. Thus they must live a life of faith on the Son of God,
   desiring to be found in him, not having their own righteousness, which
   is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
   righteousness which is of God by faith; heartily desiring and seeking
   his Spirit to dwell in them, and form their hearts to every Christian
   exercise and duty, and doing all in the name of Christ, in the exercise
   of a cordial love of his whole character, and pleasing approbation of
   the way of salvation of sinners which is revealed in the gospel.

   They must be heartily devoted to the glory of God, to his honour,
   interest and kingdom, as the supreme object of their desire and
   affection. This is necessarily implied in supreme love to him, in which
   they give themselves wholly away to him in the exercise of the most
   friendly, benevolent love, rejoicing in his being, felicity and glory.
   This is in a true and in the highest sense disinterested affection, and
   necessarily excludes all selfishness, so far as it takes place, as it
   cannot proceed from self-love as the ground of it, but is directly
   contrary to it, as it gives up all selfish affection and interest, for
   an infinitely greater, more worthy and important interest and object;
   making the being of God, his interest and honour, their supreme
   interest, the object of their highest regard, and ultimate end, to
   which all other beings and interests are wholly subordinated, as not
   worthy any regard, but to be rejected when they come in competition
   with the honour and interest of this infinitely great, worthy, and
   glorious Being. By this disposition and exercise of heart alone do they
   comply with the apostolic command, "Whether ye eat or drink, or
   whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. And that they who live,
   should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him who died for
   them and rose again." And thus they enter upon and live a life of true
   and real self denial.

   The more Christians are swallowed up in views of the glory of God, and
   their hearts desire and rejoice in the unchangeable and eternal glory
   and felicity of the Infinite Being, as the object of their whole
   pursuit, interest and happiness, which does not consist in the least
   degree in selfish affection; the more is their own salvation promoted,
   and the greater is their enjoyment, and the nearer do they get to
   heaven. The person who, under the influence of self love, or
   selfishness, seeks his own personal interest, honour and felicity
   supremely (and this is the unchangeable nature of every degree of self
   love) exerts the whole strength of his soul in direct opposition to the
   Christian affection now described; and as he regards himself supremely,
   he subordinates the being, felicity and glory of God, that he may
   answer his own selfish ends thereby, and cares nothing for the former,
   aside from his own supposed personal interest, or any farther than the
   latter may be promoted thereby. Such an affection is the strongest
   contradiction to all truth, and does love and make a lie in the highest
   and most emphatical sense. If the smallest pebble, or one grain of
   sand, should be selected and preferred to the whole material world,
   comprehending this earth, the sun, moon, and all the stars, and no
   regard be paid to the existence, order and beauty of the whole, any
   further than they relate to that single grain, and contribute to
   support and favour that infinitely small portion of the material world;
   this would not be more unreasonable and contrary to the truth, yea, it
   would be infinitely less so, than for one individual person to pay a
   supreme regard to himself, and subordinate the Infinite Being to his
   own private, personal interest and happiness, who is so great, worthy
   and glorious, that there is infinitely less proportion between such
   individual and him than there is between the least grain of sand and
   the whole material creation.

   There are too many professing Christians who embrace and pursue a
   scheme of practical religion which is as unreasonable, contrary to
   truth, and absurd, as this appears to be. They say that it is
   impossible for men to love God, so long as they consider him to be
   displeased with them, and think he does not love them; that he must
   first manifest to them that he is their friend, and loves them, and
   they must believe it before they can love him; that in this way they
   were brought to love God, and to be reconciled to his character and
   law, and to all the truths and duties of Christianity; they were
   brought first to see and believe that God loved them, and on this
   foundation only they first began to love him, and continue to be
   friendly to him. Thus they declare that all their regard and love to
   God is nothing but self love, for they love him only because he is a
   friend to them, and will answer their own selfish ends, and promote
   their own personal, selfish interest, and subordinate their Maker, and
   all his interest, to their own beloved selves. Their religion is all
   built on an impossible supposition, viz. that they had evidence that
   God loved them, before they had any love to him, and while they were
   his enemies: which is directly contrary to scripture and reason. But if
   this were not contrary to scripture, and a mere delusion, their love to
   God is as far from true friendship to him as darkness is from light;
   for it is nothing but self love at second hand, and is an affection
   which our Saviour condemns, as that which the most wicked man and
   greatest enemy of God may have. He says, "If ye love them who love
   you," (i.e. merely because they love you,) "what reward have ye? Do not
   even the publicans the same?"

   The words of the apostle John are appealed to as a support of this
   scheme of religion: "We love him because he first loved us." But these
   words are entirely misunderstood by them, and perverted to a most
   injurious and fatal purpose. The apostle does not say, "We love God
   because we first believed he loved us;" in which sense they take the
   words, in order to answer their purpose. The natural and plain meaning
   of the words, and which is pointed out by the context, is this: "God
   loved us first, and gave his Son to die for us; and he has given us a
   heart to love him, by which we have been born of God: this is the cause
   of our loving God: for if he had not thus first loved us, while we were
   enemies, and caused us to be born again by his Spirit, we should not
   have loved him: for he who is not born of God will not exercise any
   true love to him, though he should love them, and tell them he did so,
   by a particular revelation. Therefore they who love God only upon this
   selfish ground, and build all their religion upon it, however zealous
   they may be, and however much they may do, are not working out their
   own salvation, but the contrary, and never will obtain it."

   The importance of this point, and the delusion with which so many are
   deceived, it is to be feared to their own ruin, is thought to be a
   sufficient reason for this seeming digression.

   This supreme love to God, and dedication to him, living not unto
   themselves, but to and for him, implies a hearty, sensible
   acknowledgment of him in all their ways, and in all events which take
   place; seeing his hand in them all, and heartily submitting to him, and
   acquiescing in his governing providence, and rejoicing that the Lord
   reigns without control, ordering every thing, and every circumstance,
   from the greatest to the least, in the exercise of infinite power,
   wisdom, rectitude and goodness.

   This pious disposition, and these exercises of heart towards God, are
   to be expressed and acted out in all proper ways and conduct. This
   requires much care, labour, and self denial, and a strong resolution,
   and much fortitude of mind. The Christian must confess Christ before
   men, must speak for him and in his cause, whenever there is a proper
   opportunity, and must publicly profess his belief in him and cordial
   subjection to him in obedience to all his commands, and attendance upon
   all his institutions. He must pay a strict and conscientious regard to
   the sabbath, carefully avoiding all those things which tend to
   interrupt his attendance on the religious duties of that day, devoting
   the whole time as much as may be to the exercises of religion,
   constantly attending on public worship, with seriousness and devotion.
   He must attend much to the Bible, daily reading and meditating upon it,
   that he may grow in his acquaintance with it, and be entertained and
   directed by it, "as a lamp to his feet, and a light to his path." Thus
   "his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate
   day and night."

   He will attend devoutly on the Lord's supper whenever he has
   opportunity, and be careful not to neglect the important preparatory
   duties of self examination, prayer, &c. He is a friend to family
   religion; and, if the head of a family, will practise daily devotion in
   it, in attending to the word of God and prayer, taking particular care
   that the whole family attend in a serious and orderly manner, and that
   they are all instructed in things of religion, and under good
   regulation and government. And he will be careful that no worldly
   business or concern interrupt the religious duties of the family. He
   must also practise, and constantly maintain secret prayer. A Christian
   cannot maintain his spiritual life, activity and comfort in the
   omission of closet duties, and cannot work out his own salvation
   without constantly entering into his closet, agreeable to the direction
   of Christ, and being much in devotion there. The prayerless person is
   not in the way to heaven. Prayer comprehends not only petition for what
   persons want, for themselves and others, but adoration, praise and
   thanksgiving for divine beneficence to themselves and to others,
   together with humble confession of sin, unworthiness and ill-desert.
   The Christian will find abundant matter for prayer and devotion, or
   intercourse with God, every day and hour, and must in some good
   measure, at least, act up to the apostolic direction, "praying always,
   with all prayer, and supplication in the Spirit; in every thing by
   prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, make known his requests
   unto God," to whom he may have access at all times through the great
   Mediator, with humble boldness and freedom.

   And as the Christian has made a public profession of religion, and
   joined a particular Christian church, he is under covenant engagements
   to watch over his brethren and sisters, and assist in the exercise of
   discipline, agreeable to the directions of Christ; which requires great
   attention, care and resolution, in order to be acquainted with the
   truth of facts, and judge and act, so far as he is called to it,
   agreeable to the truth and the dictates of Christian love, and so as
   shall be most for the honour of Christ, and the good of every
   individual of the church. This is included in the exercise of piety
   towards God, as well as his duty to his fellow Christians. And his love
   to God will induce him to speak and act, in all companies and on all
   occasions, for the honour of God, and so as to recommend Christianity
   to all, being constantly concerned that his conversation should be as
   becometh the gospel of Christ.

   Another branch of practice by which Christians work out their own
   salvation consists in those duties which more immediately respect their
   fellow men. These are all implied in loving their neighbour as
   themselves, or doing to others as they would that others should do unto
   them, and in expressing this love in all proper ways in words and
   conduct.

   They are careful and exact to do justice to all with whom they have any
   connection, and are conscientiously concerned and engaged not to injure
   any person either in their thoughts, words or actions, in any of his
   interests, of worldly property or character, of body or soul;
   constantly watching against and opposing the many temptations and
   opportunities to do wrong to any of those with whom they have any
   concern, in the least instance or degree; taking diligent heed not to
   practise according to the many false maxims and examples of mankind,
   but making the holy scripture their constant rule in all their
   thoughts, words and dealings with others.

   And they are not only concerned and careful to do justice to all, but
   they love mercy, and wish and endeavour to do all the good they can
   unto all men, embracing all opportunities to promote their best
   interest, both temporal and eternal, whether they be friends or
   enemies. They must exercise a benevolent love to their worst enemies,
   whatever injuries they may have received from them; they must wish them
   well, do good to them, and pray for them in particular, while they are
   praying for all men. And if at any time they are convinced that they
   have injured any of their fellow men, they must not rest till they have
   made all the reparation or restitution which is in their power,
   whatever mortification, cost, and pains this may require.

   They must be careful to speak and conduct towards all with becoming
   decency and respect, whether superiors, inferiors or equals; and to set
   good examples before all, of humility, temperance, sobriety, meekness
   and kindness; being ready to every good work, practising patience,
   forgiveness and long-suffering, endeavouring to live in peace with all
   men, as far as shall be in their power. And to this end they must be
   careful to practise all those relative duties towards those who are in
   the nearest connection with them, whether husband, wife, parents,
   children, brethren, sisters, domestics, and particular relatives or
   friends. And they have particular and important duties to do towards
   their brethren and sisters of the church, of the household of faith,
   some of which have been mentioned under the preceding head. They must
   live in the exercise and expression of benevolence and kindness to
   them, being ready and careful to minister to the relief and comfort of
   their bodies, by giving them food and raiment, and affording them any
   help of which any of them shall stand in need, and by exercising and
   manifesting a particular concern and friendship for them, and
   complacency in them, in the exercise and practice of that brotherly
   love which is peculiar to Christians.

   They must be diligent and faithful in their particular calling and
   business, striving to improve their time and talents to good purpose,
   so as to have a supply for their own bodily wants, and of theirs who
   depend in any measure on them; and so as to be able to give relief to
   all who stand in need; and so as to redeem time for religious
   exercises, and the improvement of their minds in all useful knowledge,
   which in their circumstances they shall have opportunity to acquire,
   diligently improving all their time in something really useful to
   themselves or to others, or to both.

   Thirdly. Christians in working out their own salvation must persevere
   in this work, which has been imperfectly described, to the end of life.

   Christ said to the Jews who professed to believe on him, "If ye
   continue in my words, then are ye my disciples indeed," [John viii.
   31:] which words imply that none are the true disciples of Christ but
   those who persevere in obedience to him to the end of life. They only
   who overcome, are faithful unto death, and endure to the end, shall be
   saved: [Math. x. 22; Rev. ii. 7, 10.) "If any man draw back, my soul
   shall have no pleasure in him," and he draws back unto perdition: [Heb.
   x. 33, 39.]

   Fourthly. The Christian, in working out his own salvation, must
   increase and make progress in his labour and work, and daily do more
   and more. He must make advances in knowledge and skill in his business,
   and increase in zeal, engagedness and activity.

   When a Christian enters on his work, he may be compared to a youth who
   begins to work at some trade. By working he continually increases in
   skill and ability to work: he daily makes advances in his work, and
   does more and more in a day, till he is perfect in his trade and
   business. So the Christian who is working out his own salvation not
   only continues and perseveres in his work, but his work increases on
   his hands, and he gains in skill and strength, in his engagedness and
   activity, and does and abounds more and more. Increase in grace and
   holiness is as necessary in order to obtain salvation, as perseverance.
   It is essential to the nature of true grace to grow and increase in the
   exercise of it; so that it is as certain that he who does not make any
   advances in a holy life, and increase in his work, and abound more and
   more, is not in the way to heaven, and has no true grace, as it is of
   him who falls away, and wholly ceases to work. "The path of the just is
   as the shining light, which shineth more and more to the perfect day."
   There is no way to heaven but this.

   The apostle Paul tells the church at Philippi, to whom he gave the
   direction in the text, that in working out his own salvation he was
   striving to press forward, and go on in his Christian course till he
   should arrive to perfection, not resting in any past or present
   attainments: "Not as though I had already attained, either were already
   perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which
   also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Forgetting the things which are
   behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press
   toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
   Jesus." The apostles insist much on this, as the character and duty of
   Christians, that they increase and abound more and more in each
   Christian grace and in every good work. This will appear by the
   following quotations: "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast,
   unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord." To abound in the
   work of the Lord is to increase in working, and to do more and more. In
   this sense the word abound is frequently used, which will appear from
   the passages which will now be quoted: "And this I pray, that your love
   may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment: [Phil.
   i. 9.] And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
   another, and toward all men. Furthermore, then, we beseech you,
   brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of
   us how ye ought to walk and please God, so ye would abound more and
   more. Ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another: but we
   beseech you, brethren, that ye [increase more and more: [1 Thess. iii.
   12; iv. 1, 9, 10.] That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
   pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the
   knowledge of God: [Col. i. 10.] For if these things, (i.e. the
   Christian graces which he had just mentioned,) be in you and abound,
   they shall make you that ye shall be neither barren nor unfruitful in
   the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For if ye do these things, ye
   shall never fall. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you
   abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ. Beloved, beware lest ye, being led away with the error of the
   wicked, fall from your own stedfastness: but grow in grace, and in the
   knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ:" [2 Pet. i. 8, 10, 11;
   iii. 17, 18.) In these words, abounding in every Christian grace, and
   growing in grace, and in the knowledge of Christ, is represented the
   only sure way to escape falling into destruction, and to enter into the
   kingdom of heaven. The same truth was inculcated by Christ: "Every
   branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away; and every branch
   that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit."
   According to this there are but two sorts of visible Christians, viz.
   they who are not real Christians, and consequently bear no fruit; and
   they who are true Christians, and are fruitful, being constantly purged
   so as to increase in their fruit, and bear more fruit the longer they
   live. And that this must be so is plain and certain, because for a man
   to work out his own salvation is to do that by which he is ripening,
   preparing and becoming more meet for the kingdom of heaven; which he
   cannot do but by growing in grace, and becoming more and more holy, and
   going on toward perfection in holiness: and this is the same with
   abounding more and more in every good work.

   This is the work and life of a Christian, a description of which has
   been now attempted in order to show what is intended by his working out
   his own salvation. This attempt, though imperfect and defective, will
   serve to discover what this work is, according to the holy scriptures,
   in the most essential part of it, and that it is indeed a very great
   work, infinitely the greatest, most difficult and important, that any
   man ever engaged in and performed.

   Some, it may be, will be ready to say, as the disciples of Christ said
   to their Lord, on a certain occasion, "Who then can be saved!" If this
   be the work of a Christian, and the only way to work out our own
   salvation; if men must thus deny all ungodliness, and every worldly
   lust, and must live thus soberly, righteously and godly in the world;
   if they must be so strict, careful, watchful, painful and laborious in
   this work; if they have to oppose and conquer such numerous, crafty and
   powerful enemies, and must deny themselves, and take up their cross
   daily; if they can have no respite, can never be released from this
   work, by night or by day, but must persevere in it to the end of life;
   and not only so, but their work increases on their hands every day, so
   that the longer they work, the more is required, and the more they do,
   the more they have to do; if this be the case with man, if this be the
   only way to heaven, who will ever get there! If there be any in the way
   to salvation, surely they are very few; the most are like to miss of it
   forever. And who can have courage to engage in such a work as this! and
   how is this consistent with the words of Christ: "Take my yoke upon
   you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall
   find rest to your souls: for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light?"

   A full answer to this is found in the reply of Christ to the question
   which his disciples put to him: "Who then can be saved?" "This is
   indeed impossible with men, but not with God; for with God all things
   are possible." Though man, in his fallen, depraved state, be altogether
   unequal to this work, and will never, of himself, do any thing to any
   purpose; yet, by the help of God, by his grace and assistance, he may
   do all this, and work out his own salvation; and he will find it to be
   not only possible, and that, by Christ strengthening him, he can do all
   these things, and more; but the most agreeable and pleasant work in
   which man can be employed. This is held forth in the text, which is to
   be farther explained, and will be more particularly considered in the
   sequel.

   But before we pass to this, several observations will be made with
   regard to working out our own salvation, as it has been described,
   which may prevent any misunderstanding, and throw further light on the
   subject.

   I. By Christians working out their own salvation is not meant that by
   this they so recommend themselves to God, that out of regard to the
   worth and merit of their good works they obtain an interest in the
   divine promises, and a title to salvation. The declarations of
   scripture are directly contrary to such a supposition. "By grace are ye
   saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of
   God. Not of works: for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
   unto good works. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
   according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration and
   renewing of the Holy Ghost." Men are brought into a state of salvation,
   and an interest in the promises of the covenant of grace, and have a
   title to eternal life, by the first act which unites them to him, that
   is, by the first exercise of faith on him. They do not earn or merit
   salvation by their works, nor do they aim at or attempt this, or have
   the least desire of it. They are so far from this, that their first
   holy exercise implies a sense of their unworthiness and ill desert; and
   they come to Christ for salvation as a free gift to the infinitely
   unworthy and ill deserving, trusting in his merit and righteousness to
   recommend them to all that favour and salvation which they desire and
   seek after. And all this is expressed or implied in all they do in
   working out their own salvation. They are so far from offering any
   thing of their own as the price of their salvation, that all their
   working and exertions are implied in coming to Christ and trusting in
   him for complete redemption as a free, undeserved gift, to be obtained
   through him, without money or price. And all they do in working out
   their own salvation consists essentially in this, in coming to Christ
   for all, and receiving all from him, even strength, righteousness and
   salvation, in a sense of their total unworthiness of the least good,
   and desert of infinite evil.

   It is of importance that this point should be viewed in this scriptural
   light, and kept in mind, to prevent those dangerous mistakes into which
   many have fallen.

   Moreover, real Christians not only have an interest in salvation by
   promise, when they begin to work it out; but if it were not so, all
   they do in working out their salvation is so far from meriting or
   deserving salvation, or any favour, that they continually deserve to be
   excluded from it forever and to perish; and by all they do they do not
   become less ill deserving than they were before they began to work, but
   more so. All they do is so defiled with sin, is so deficient, and comes
   so far short of what is their duty, that for this they deserve to be
   given up to evil, and perish, and must perish after all, were it not
   for the merits of Christ; in whom they are accepted in all their holy
   exercises and works, and their sins are pardoned, and through his
   righteousness they receive the reward of eternal life. This every
   Christian feels constantly, and acknowledges to be true with regard to
   himself, while he is with the greatest care and diligence working out
   his own salvation.

   II. Christians do not work out their own salvation in their own
   strength, but by the special and constant assistance and powerful
   influences of the Spirit of God, by which they are made strong in the
   Lord and in the power of his might. Christians are in themselves
   altogether unequal to this work; being nothing but weakness and
   insufficiency: it is infinitely too great and arduous for them: they
   depend entirely and constantly on the grace and assistance of God, in
   order to do any thing effectually towards it. This is abundantly
   declared in the scripture. Christ tells his disciples, "Without me ye
   can do nothing." And he said to the apostle Paul, "My grace is
   sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness." Paul
   therefore dared to say, "I can do all things through Christ, who
   strengtheneth me. For when I am weak, then am I strong. By the grace of
   God I am what I am: and his grace, which was bestowed upon me, was not
   in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but
   the grace of God which was with me." According to our text, it is God
   who worketh in them both to will and to do this great work which is
   before them. Without his energy, and constant effectual operation on
   their hearts, they would not take one step in this work, or put forth
   any act of will towards it. But this will be more particularly
   considered in further attending to this subject.

   III. This work is as necessary to be done in order to salvation as it
   would be if men obtained a title to salvation by thus working, and
   merited it by their good works. Though men are not saved by or for
   their holiness, yet holiness is as necessary to salvation, as if they
   were; for deliverance from sin, and turning from it, and the exercise
   of holiness, is essential to salvation, as the latter can have no
   existence without the former. It is as necessary that men should be
   holy in order to salvation, as it would be were they to obtain a title
   to it and merit it by their holiness and good works; for it still
   remains true, that without holiness no man shall see the Lord, or enjoy
   salvation. But to be holy and exercise holiness, is to work out
   salvation, in the sense of the text, and as it has been now described.

   The moral inability of man to exercise holiness, and go on to
   perfection in holiness of himself, does not make it in any degree less
   necessary that he should be holy in order to be happy; and therefore
   not the less necessary that in order to be holy men should be active
   and work; for that men should live a holy life, or be holy, without
   working, or the exercise of holiness, is a contradiction.

   IV. Though men are morally unable to work out their own salvation of
   themselves, but depend on God for assistance and grace, by which he
   worketh in them both to will and to do it; yet it is not only as
   necessary they should do these works, but they e as much their own
   works and actions, as if they did them of themselves, without any
   assistance and powerful, effectual influence from God. God's assisting
   men to do these works, does not make them the less man's own exercises
   and works, than if they did them without any assistance. Every act of
   any person's will or choice, and all the designed attendants and
   consequences of such a volition, are his own exercises and actions, and
   it is impossible it should be otherwise, whatever influences he is the
   subject of in order to his thus willing and acting. Whatever a man
   wills, and does in the execution of his will, are his own exercises of
   will, and his own actions, and cannot be otherwise; and to assert the
   contrary is always an untruth and a palpable contradiction.

   It would be needless to make this observation, were it not that some
   have been so thoughtless and absurd, however learned and judicious in
   other matters, as to say, that if God worketh in men to will and to do,
   so that their choice and doing is the effect of what God does work in
   them, then it is God who wills and does, and not man; and if there be
   any virtue or goodness in what is done, it is the virtue and goodness
   of God, and not man's. But this is manifestly most absurd, and contrary
   to the reason and common sense of mankind; for they feel and know that
   every thing which men will and do is their own choice and deed, and not
   of any other; and that, whatever induced them thus to will and do; and
   that it is as much their own act and deed, as if they had done it
   without any such influence. And if what they do be right and virtuous,
   it is as much their own virtue and goodness, as it could be if they had
   done it without any influence or assistance from others.

   Upon the whole, to conclude this head, it appears that Christians have
   a great work to do, which is absolutely necessary in order to be saved,
   in which they must be active, must will and do it. And this is to
   perfect holiness in the fear of God, and work out their own salvation
   with fear and trembling. And this is the work spoken of in the text; a
   description of which has been attempted in the preceding discourse:
   which may God bless to the benefit of all who shall give to it a proper
   attention. Amen.

SERMON XI.

   Phil. ii. 12, 13. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
   For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
   pleasure.

   IN attending to these words, it has been attempted to consider and shew
   what is intended by Christians working out their own salvation. This
   has been endeavoured in the preceding discourses. It is now proposed,

   II. To consider what is meant by their doing this with fear and
   trembling.

   It is of importance to observe here, and let it be kept in view, that
   this passage of scripture cannot be understood, and the true sense of
   it given, unless the real meaning of these words be properly
   ascertained, and fixed in our minds: for they are really the key by
   which alone the meaning of the whole passage is opened, and without
   which the true intent and force of these words of the Apostle cannot be
   perceived. This, it is expected, will be made to appear before the
   subject is dismissed; and is a reason why these words should be
   examined with particular care and attention, that the true import of
   them may not be overlooked, and they be taken in a wrong sense, but the
   true meaning of them be known and fixed.

   The drift and force of the exhortation of the apostle is not merely to
   work out their own salvation, but has a principal and chief respect to
   the manner of doing this, which is expressed in the words, "With fear
   and trembling." Therefore in these words is contained an essential part
   of the exhortation; and to this part, which points out the manner and
   only way in which they could work out their own salvation, the
   following words do wholly refer, as an argument to enforce it: "For it
   is God who worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good
   pleasure." This is a reason, not merely why they should work out their
   own salvation, but why they should do this with fear and trembling, as
   the only way in which it could be done. Whatever men may do, and
   however much and great pains and labour they may take in working out
   their salvation: yet if they do not this with fear and trembling, they
   will fail of obtaining salvation. This points out the only way to
   heaven. But this will be more particularly considered and illustrated
   in the prosecution of this subject.

   The following particulars will serve to lead to the true meaning of
   fear and trembling.

   1. These words must intend something which is right and becoming all
   Christians at all times, while they are working out their own
   salvation. It is what is essential to all truly Christian grace and
   exercises, and belongs to the beauty and excellence of their character:
   and as they cannot be real Christians and live as such without it, so
   the more they have of it, the better and more strong and excellent
   Christians they are. If this were not so, the Apostle would not have
   exhorted them, and consequently all Christians, at all times and in all
   ages, thus to work out their own salvation. It would be injurious and
   absurd to suppose that he exhorted to those exercises and that practice
   which are not virtuous and excellent, and becoming all Christians, at
   all times, as their indispensable duty, in which they are bound to
   excel, and cannot be practised to excess. This observation, of the
   truth of which none can doubt, will help to shew what is not intended
   by fear and trembling here, viz. all those exercises which are wrong,
   or are a blemish and imperfection in the character of a Christian.
   These must all be excluded, and will lead to the observations
   following.

   2. The Apostle does not exhort Christians to work out their own
   salvation under the influence of a servile, slavish fear of God, in
   which no true love is implied, but is contrary to a spirit of love.
   This is sometimes meant by fear in the scriptures, and is condemned as
   contrary to a Christian spirit of love and true obedience. This Apostle
   says to Christians, "Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again
   to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
   Abba Father. God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of
   love and of a sound mind:" [Rom. viii. 15; 2 Tim. i. 7.] [4] He
   therefore certainly did not exhort Christians to exercise such fear in
   working out their salvation. The apostle John says there is no fear in
   love; but perfect love casteth out fear. He that feareth is not made
   perfect in love.

   3. By fear and trembling here is not meant a constant, trembling fear
   of falling away and perishing at last. This cannot be the meaning,
   because this is not the duty of all Christians, and cannot be
   considered as a Christian virtue, but rather an imperfection, and at
   least a defect of grace. Christians are directed to make their calling
   and election sure. The Apostle speaks of those Christians to whom he
   gave the exhortation under consideration, as those of whom he was
   confident that God would carry on the work he had begun in them, until
   the day of Jesus Christ. And how could he direct them to tremble with
   fear of perishing, when he at the same time had told them he was
   confident that Christ would save them? Why might not they be as
   confident of their salvation as he was? He speaks in the language of
   assurance of his own salvation in this letter. He speaks of his own
   death as connected with his being with Christ. And he says of himself,
   with others, "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
   dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands,
   eternal in the heavens." And no doubt some, if not many, of the
   Christians at Philippi had a comfortable assurance of their interest in
   the covenant of grace, and consequently that they should be saved. It
   is certain that the Apostle did not know that this was not true of
   them. It is therefore certain that he considered this exhortation to be
   applicable to the most assured Christian that was then on earth, or
   ever will live in this world, and pointed out their duty as much as of
   those who were in doubt whether they should be saved or not. The
   Apostle himself, and every assured Christian, had as much of this fear
   and trembling as any Christian whatever; and it was as much his and
   their duty and privilege, and essential to their character, in which
   they would abound more and more as they advanced in the Christian life
   and excellent attainments.

   The word fear is often used in scripture in a sense which denotes that
   which is a virtue and real piety, and in this sense are fear and
   trembling used. And the fear of the Lord, or to fear God, commonly
   means the exercise of true piety. Of this all who read the Bible with
   attention are sensible.

   From the foregoing observations it evidently appears, that by fear and
   trembling in the text must be intended Christian humility, with all the
   natural and necessary attendants of it, consisting in a sense of their
   own depravity and guilt, or ill desert, and of their total moral
   impotence and insufficiency in themselves, to work out their own
   salvation, or to will and do any thing towards it; with an entire and
   constant dependence on and trust in God the Saviour for pardon and
   acceptance, through his atonement, and the influences of his Spirit to
   give them moral discerning, strength and ability to work out their own
   salvation, in a sense of his greatness, majesty, power and sovereignty,
   who has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he
   hardeneth; and of their own littleness, vileness, and infinite
   unworthiness of the least favour; while they view destruction, which
   they deserve, and shall certainly fall into, unless they are rescued by
   the mighty power and sovereign grace of God, in all the horrors and
   dreadfulness of it; and the infinite greatness, worth, and importance
   of that salvation which is given by Christ to all who believe and obey
   him.

   That all this is implied in that humility and faith which is essential
   to the character of a Christian, and by which he lives, and works out
   his own salvation, none can doubt who properly attends to the subject.
   And that the whole of this is implied and expressed in the words fear
   and trembling, is evident, from the use of those words in other places,
   and on different occasions, and from what follows in the passage we are
   upon.

   We find these words used three times, beside that in the text before
   us, by this apostle. He says to the Corinthians, "I was with you in
   weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling." He seems here to set
   himself designedly in contrast with those whom he calls false apostles,
   who appeared proud and self-sufficient, and affected a great parade and
   shew of their own abilities and accomplishments, and boasted great
   things. On the contrary, when he was with them, and God did great
   things among them by his ministry, in their conversion, he gloried not
   in himself, but in the Lord, and laboured among them in fear and much
   trembling, in a pressing sense of his own weakness, and insufficiency
   for the great work in which he was engaged; that he was nothing, and
   that God alone could give the increase and success desired. He
   expresses the same thing in the following words: "Not that we are
   sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves, but our
   sufficiency is of God." When he speaks of the Corinthians receiving
   Titus with fear and trembling, the meaning is, that they received him
   in humility and lowliness of mind, in a sense of their own sinfulness
   and unworthiness, and readiness to receive instruction from him,
   sensible of their ignorance and need of being taught; in opposition to
   self-sufficiency and pride, undervaluing and despising him.

   This same Apostle says to servants, "Be obedient unto them who are your
   masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling." None can
   reasonably suppose that servants are here commanded to act from a
   servile, slavish fear of their masters, doing all and obeying them out
   of fear of their rod: for this is not a commendable spirit in servants.
   By fear and trembling is evidently meant a spirit of humility and
   submission to the will of their masters; willing to take their own
   proper place; not setting up for themselves, but feeling their
   dependence upon their masters for all temporal support, realizing the
   evil consequence of a contrary spirit and conduct, of pride and
   self-sufficiency. And in Romans xi. 20, he uses the word fear to denote
   a Christian virtue, in opposition to pride and self-confidence: "Well,
   because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith.
   Be not high minded, but fear."

   And that the meaning of fear and trembling in the text which has been
   given is the only true meaning, is evident from the words which
   immediately follow these: "For it is God which worketh in you, both to
   will and to do, of his good pleasure." This is given as the reason why
   they should work out their own salvation with fear and trembling. And
   this is a good reason why they should do this, in a humbling sense of
   their own depravity, unworthiness, and moral inability to work out
   their own salvation, and continually maintain self-diffidence, in a
   sense of the greatness of the work, and their own insufficiency, and
   their entire dependence on God for his powerful influence on their
   hearts, in order to their willing and doing, and taking one step in
   their Christian course. But if these words are not taken in this sense,
   the propriety and force of the argument cannot be discerned, and is
   lost. But this is to be more fully considered under another head.

   Having given a summary of the meaning of fear and trembling in the
   text, in order more fully to elucidate this point it will be proper, if
   not necessary, particularly to shew what is implied in this general
   account; which may be done under the following heads.

   1. Fear and trembling implies a trembling conviction and sense of their
   own weakness, and total insufficiency, in themselves, to work out their
   own salvation, while they have some true view of the greatness,
   difficulty, importance and necessity of the work, and that it must be
   done by them, being most reasonable, and their indispensable duty.

   This self-diffidence every Christian feels and constantly exercises in
   disclaiming all moral power and ability to do any thing towards his
   salvation, if left to himself, and is necessarily implied in that
   humility denoted by fear and trembling.

   2. This is attended with a thorough conviction, and sensible
   acknowledgment, that this their weakness and utter insufficiency is
   wholly their own fault; that it consists in their moral depravity, and
   the inexcusable wickedness of their own hearts. This conviction and
   view of themselves strikes death to their pride, and is an essential
   ingredient in Christian humility, and in fear and trembling.

   3. Consequently, fear and trembling includes in it an affecting
   conviction of their own unworthiness and ill desert; that they are
   utterly unworthy of salvation, and of that assistance and grace by
   which alone they can obtain it, and deserve to be left of God to fall
   into destruction; which would certainly be the case, in a moment, if
   God should deal with them according to their folly and crimes, and
   withhold from them that assistance and sovereign goodness which they
   are constantly forfeiting, and pour that evil on their heads which they
   are provoking him to inflict; that they are therefore in the hands of a
   sovereign God, who has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
   will he hardeneth. This view and sense of the truth will not be in the
   least removed or abated by the strongest well grounded hope and
   confidence that this sovereign God has had mercy on them; and therefore
   does not in any degree exclude the humility, the fear and trembling,
   implied in a real and constant conviction of these truths.

   4. Fear and trembling implies a fearful and trembling sense of the
   infinite and amazing dreadfulness of endless destruction, which the
   Christian considers and dreads as his certain portion, if he should
   have his desert, and not be rescued and saved from it, by the constant
   exertion of the mighty power and sovereign grace of Jesus Christ. The
   strongest Christian hope and assurance that they have a divine promise
   that they shall escape this evil, and be kept by the mighty power of
   Christ, through faith, unto salvation, will not remove or abate this
   awful view of destruction: but they who have the highest well-grounded
   confidence of their salvation, will have the greatest sense of the evil
   implied in perishing forever.

   5. A belief and sense of the infinite greatness, power and terrible
   majesty of God, and a correspondent conviction of their own littleness
   and nothingness in his sight, impressing an awe of his displeasure, and
   dread of sinning against him, is implied in fear and trembling. This
   sense and feeling will increase, as Christians grow in grace and in the
   knowledge of Jesus Christ, whatever evidence and assurance they may
   have of the favour and love of God.

   6. The Christian works out his own salvation with fear and trembling,
   while he constantly views and feels the dangers with which he is
   surrounded, by which he is liable to fall and perish, and against which
   he has no strength and security in himself; that he is always
   surrounded by innumerable hosts of invisible, subtle, potent enemies,
   who are seeking his eternal ruin, and doing all they can to prevent his
   salvation; while he has no more power or skill in himself to resist or
   escape their rage, and destruction by them, than an infant has to
   conquer a roaring lion.

   This is the representation which Christ himself gives of the state and
   circumstances of a Christian, while in this world. He speaks to every
   Christian of which his church is composed in the following language:
   "Look unto me from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the
   leopards." [Solomon's Song, iv. 8.] He speaks to his church, and to
   every believer of which it is composed, as dwelling among lions, even
   in their dens, continually exposed to be devoured by them; and in the
   midst of leopards, beasts of prey, who conceal themselves in thickets
   and on trees, from which they suddenly dart themselves, seize and
   devour men as they pass: denoting that they are in such a dangerous
   state in this world, and continually exposed to be destroyed by
   powerful, invisible enemies, which is fully represented by persons
   lying in the dens of hungry, devouring lions, or on mountains haunted
   by leopards, every moment exposed to be destroyed by them, having
   nothing to defend themselves from them. He calls to them to look to him
   as their only refuge and deliverer, letting them know their dangerous,
   helpless situation, and that in him alone their help is found.

   7. This is attended with a constant and increasing view and sense of
   the dangerous enemies which they have within themselves, consisting in
   their moral depravity and evil propensities; that if Christ should
   leave them to themselves, they should immediately turn his enemies, and
   join with the devil, and be on his side and espouse his cause in
   opposition to Jesus Christ, and finally fall with him into eternal
   destruction.

   8. Fear and trembling is not only consistent with, but necessarily
   implies, a humble and constant dependence on Jesus Christ alone for
   grace and strength to follow him through all these dangers and
   difficulties, leaning on his almighty arm, his infinite wisdom,
   goodness, truth and faithfulness, for pardon of their sins through his
   atonement, and deliverance from moral depravity; for power and skill to
   restrain and conquer their own lusts, and escape everlasting
   destruction; trusting in him to work in them both to will and to do all
   that is implied in their working out their own salvation. This, and all
   which has been mentioned in the above particulars, is implied in fear
   and trembling; in that humility and saving faith by which the Christian
   lives, and works out his own salvation. By this he becomes strong in
   the Lord, and in the power of his might. His grace is sufficient for
   him, and by it he overcomes.

   9. As every Christian is coming vastly short in his duty in every thing
   which he does, and is constantly guilty of much sin, so he is in danger
   of unthought of deviations from his duty, and by temptations to fall
   into particular gross sins, against which he has no security but the
   promises of the covenant of grace; and to escape these he depends upon
   the sovereign will of God, who worketh in him both to will and to do,
   of his own good pleasure. This is the ground of a constant dread of
   every sin of omission or commission, and continual care and watching
   against all sin, and fear of displeasing God, so as to leave him to
   commit some particular sin, in a trembling sense of his own weakness,
   and the certainty that he shall not avoid it unless God be pleased to
   prevent it, by working in him to will and do the contrary. With this
   view and feeling the Christian ought daily to walk while he is working
   out his own salvation, however assured he may be that he shall not fall
   away finally and miss of salvation. And this is implied in the fear and
   trembling recommended in the text.

   10. While Christians are working out their own salvation with fear and
   trembling, they are sensible and acknowledge that by their own works,
   and the utmost they can do, they do not in the least recommend
   themselves to God as deserving any favour on this account; but are
   infinitely ill deserving as sinners, for which all they do makes not
   the least atonement; and so much depravity and sin constantly attends
   them in all they will and do, that they are continually adding to their
   guilt and ill desert. They therefore utterly renounce all dependence on
   their own righteousness, and trust wholly to the atonement and
   righteousness of Jesus Christ for the pardon of their sins, and for all
   the favour and blessings they want and hope for, willing and rejoicing
   to receive all this purely for the sake of his atonement and
   worthiness, while they are considered in themselves as infinitely
   unworthy of the least favour, and deserving of endless destruction.
   This view of themselves, and cordial acknowledgment of it, is agreeably
   to truth, and essential to Christian humility, while they live by faith
   on Jesus Christ, and "walk humbly with God." Thus the Christian saith,
   (it is the constant language of his heart,) "In the Lord have I
   righteousness and strength;" strength to work out my own salvation, and
   righteousness to recommend me to pardon and the favour of God. In the
   exercise of this fear and trembling the apostle Paul renounced all
   dependence on his own works, desiring to be found in Christ, not having
   any righteousness of his own, but that which is through the faith of
   Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. Such only are of a
   contrite and humble spirit, who tremble at the word of God; constantly
   flying for refuge from the wrath to come, and laying hold on the hope
   set before them in Christ Jesus. He who trusts to himself that he is
   righteous, and attempts to recommend himself to God, or thinks he
   deserveth any favour for his own works, exerciseth that pride and self
   confidence which excludes fear and trembling, and is contrary to living
   by faith.

   What has been now said, in the description of fear and trembling, may
   be in a partial and imperfect manner represented by the following
   similitude.

   A person finds himself in the midst of a hideous forest and thicket, in
   which are impassable mountains, swamps and dreadful precipices; he
   himself is sick unto death, and not able to walk a step, while he sees
   himself surrounded by hungry lions, and innumerable other beasts of
   prey, threatening to rush upon him and devour him. And on consideration
   he finds he has brought himself into this dangerous, wretched state by
   his own inexcusable folly, and that his disorders and weakness are
   really his own fault; that he has greatly abused the Lord and owner of
   the territory in which he is, and all things in it; that he might
   therefore justly in his displeasure deliver him to the tormentors, and
   to be miserably devoured by the fierce beasts of prey. While he is in
   this situation, giving himself up to despair, as wholly lost and doomed
   to inevitable destruction, the great personage, the owner of the forest
   and all that it contained, appears to him, and tells him that though he
   had abused him, and had ruined himself, by his own inexcusable folly,
   yet he was ready to forgive him, and was able and disposed to cure him
   of his disorders, and give him strength to walk, and to extricate him
   from the evil and dangerous state in which he was, and make him happy
   in the most agreeable circumstances. Upon this he stretched out his
   hand, and bid him take hold of it, and he should be safely led out of
   this horrid place. The poor man felt an invisible energy accompanying
   this proposal and command, by which he was strengthened and willing to
   lay fast hold of the nobleman's hand, and to trust wholly in him as his
   deliverer, pleased to be wholly dependent on him for all the good he
   wanted, having in himself not the least sufficiency to help himself,
   and being utterly unworthy of the favour now offered to him, firmly
   believing the truth and ability of his patron to accomplish all he had
   promised.

   The nobleman told him, that though he depended wholly on him for all
   his strength to act and walk, and every volition to exert himself in
   order to escape the dangers of this wilderness, resist the wild beasts,
   pass through the swamps and miry marshes, ascend the steep mountains,
   and stand firm on the brink and side of dreadful precipices, and arrive
   to the promised land; yet he must be active, and work out this his
   salvation in the exercise of his own care and constant labor; he must
   resist the beasts of prey, and by his watchfulness and exertions in
   every step of the dangerous, difficult way he had to go, he must
   persevere in his work, and in obedience to him, till he should bring
   him to a place of safety and rest; that, in a sense of his own
   insufficiency to will or do any thing in this travel in order to his
   salvation, and his total and constant dependence on his patron, for
   disposition and strength to will and do, and persevere in the work
   before him, he must keep his eye upon him, and place all his trust in
   him, keeping hold of his hand, or of a strong cord which should be
   fastened to himself, his patron, and always be in his reach, when his
   hand was not. And in this way he should be carried safely on to the
   land of promise.

   Thus the poor man set out, confiding in the power, truth and
   faithfulness of his patron, and disclaiming all confidence in himself;
   continuing his course through hideous swamps, and over high and steep
   mountains, and on the edge of dreadful precipices, when, by losing his
   hold or taking one wrong step he should fall and be dashed in pieces in
   a moment, unless prevented by his guide, making use of the strong cord
   when his patron was out of sight. Thus he went on in the exercise of
   constant care and watchfulness, and incessant exertion, taking heed
   that every step of his should be according to the direction of his
   leader; and found that the efforts which he made to resist the wild
   beasts of prey, which continually sought to devour him, were effectual
   to make them fly from him, and thus he kept himself from their deadly
   touch. And the farther he went, he became more afraid of displeasing
   his guide, who was so worthy, kind and condescending; and increased in
   a sense of his danger if left to himself, and the certainty and
   dreadfulness of the destruction which would in that case await him;
   confiding altogether in the power, wisdom, truth and goodness of his
   patron. He sometimes in a measure forgot his own weakness, and constant
   dependence on his patron, and attempted to stand and walk in his own
   strength; but this always cost him dear, for when he thought thus to
   stand, he certainly fell, and it proved the occasion of shame and
   humiliation. And he made many wrong steps, which he knew was offensive
   to his patron, which filled him with shame and pain, and served to
   increase self-abhorrence and diffidence in himself. Thus he went on
   through all the difficulties and dangers of the way, in fear and
   trembling, increasing in self-diffidence and humility, and in his
   humble dependence and trust in his able, faithful patron, till he came
   to the promised land of safety and rest, where he is to live a happy
   and endless life.

   From the whole which has been said in the description of fear and
   trembling, the result is, that it consists most essentially in
   Christian humility and poverty of spirit, in a sense of their own
   weakness and insufficiency to work out their own salvation, and a
   humble trust in God for his constant, powerful energy on their hearts,
   disposing and prompting them effectually to will and to do all that
   they must will and do in order to be saved; together with all those
   views and exercises which are implied in this, according to the various
   objects in their sight, and the circumstances with which they are
   attended. This is essential to the life of all Christians, and to the
   exercise of every Christian grace; and the more they have of this, the
   stronger and more beautiful Christians they are. Thus the apostle Paul
   worked out his own salvation with fear and trembling, while confident
   and assured of the favour and love of God, and of eternal life. He felt
   himself to be nothing but weakness, while he was strong in the Lord; to
   be less than the least of all saints, and that he was nothing, and the
   chief of sinners. He felt that all his sufficiency was of God; that by
   his grace working effectually in him, he was what he was, and did what
   he did in the Christian life. Well might he then recommend this fear
   and trembling to all Christians, as essential to their character,
   without which all their attempts to work out their own salvation would
   be in vain, and end in sad disappointment.

   And if this Apostle did work out his salvation with fear and trembling,
   then the greatest and most assured Christian does not get beyond or
   above this; but the more he has of it, the greater is his strength and
   excellence. This has been in some measure kept in view through the
   whole of this description of fear and trembling. And the Christian who
   has not an assurance of his salvation, but at times is in great doubts
   whether he be a real Christian or not; though he may differ in some
   respects in his views, feelings and exercises from the assured
   Christian, yet he is working out his own salvation with this same fear
   and trembling which the assured Christian has, while he is attended
   with many doubts and fears, which perfect, or a more strong love would
   cast out.

   From the foregoing view of fear and trembling, it appears to consist in
   a disposition and exercises of heart which are in direct opposition to
   a self-righteous spirit, or a trust and confidence in ourselves,
   relying on our own strength and sufficiency to work out our own
   salvation, depending on this as a righteousness to recommend to divine
   favour. They who are of this disposition depend on themselves to move
   first, and set themselves to work out their own salvation, hoping for
   all the favour they think they want, as the consequence of their thus
   working, and out of regard to it. This evil disposition, which is
   contrary to the nature of Christian exercises, our Saviour sets in a
   clear and striking light in the character and conduct of the pharisee,
   who applies to God in a confidence in his own sufficiency and
   righteousness, trusting in himself that he is righteous, valuing
   himself on his own supposed good character, and despising others. The
   publican is an instance of humble fear and trembling.

SERMON XII.

   Phil. ii. 12, 13. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
   For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
   pleasure.

   III. THE next thing proposed is, to consider and show what is the
   meaning of God's working in Christians both to will and to do of his
   good pleasure. This may be done by attending to the following
   particulars.

   1. Working in men to will and to do, must intend more than affording
   them external means and advantages, and urging them by external motives
   to will and to do; for this cannot with any propriety be called working
   in them, when all that is supposed to be done is done out of them and
   externally. Some have supposed this to be all the meaning of these
   words; not because it is the natural meaning of them, for it is a
   forced meaning; but because they think man needs no more to be done for
   him in order to his working out his own salvation, and that any thing
   more, and an immediate operation on the will, is inconsistent with his
   liberty, and his actions being his own, or really virtuous. But the
   absurdity of all this has been often fully shewn, and will appear
   before this subject is finished. It is sufficient to observe here, that
   to say that an operation on the human heart which effectually
   influences men to will and to do, that is, to act voluntarily, and
   consequently freely, is inconsistent with their acting voluntarily, and
   willing and doing any thing in the exercise of all the liberty which
   can in nature exist or be conceived of, is inconsistent with human
   liberty, is as flat and palpable a contradiction as can be made. If to
   work in men so as effectually to prevent their willing and doing in any
   particular instance, be inconsistent with their having or exercising
   any freedom in that instance; then working in them so as effectually to
   make them will and do in that instance, or any other, is to promote
   their liberty, and cause them to act freely. And to say that what men
   do voluntarily is not in all cases their own act and deed, is to say
   that men are not capable of doing any thing which is their own act; for
   they can do nothing but what they do voluntarily, and the stronger and
   the more forcibly the motives are impressed on their minds to induce
   them to will and act, the more freely they act, and the more sensibly
   are their choice and actions their own, and the more virtuous they are,
   if agreeable to the truth.

   2. This does not mean any divine operation on man, which respects his
   willing and doing, of which willing and doing is not the certain
   consequence, and which therefore is consistent with his not willing and
   doing. For any divine operation in man, of which his willing and doing
   is not the effect, is not working in him to will and to do; because,
   notwithstanding such operation, he is left short of willing and doing.
   To work in men to will and to do, is to do that which is effectual to
   produce the will and the deed, so that there is a certain connection
   between the former and the latter. And this is the import of the
   original word here translated worketh. It signifies, to operate with
   energy, and effectually to accomplish the end, and produce the willing
   and doing.

   That working in men to will which leaves them short of willing, is the
   same with working in them to will, if they will, which is talking most
   absurdly. Men are always able to will, if they will, and need no
   special assistance or influence on them to will what they will, or if
   they will, which is the same. If men are willing, or do will, they have
   no need of any operation or assistance to make them willing; for this
   they have already by the supposition; for they at all times can will,
   if they will. There can therefore be no such operation; and any
   supposed assistance or working in them which leaves them not actually
   willing or doing is not working in them to will and to do.

   3. God worketh in Christians to will and to do, by giving them the
   powerful influences of his Spirit, without which they would neither
   will nor do those things by which they work out their own salvation,
   and which are effectual to cause them to will and do them; there being
   a certain and infallible connection of one with the other.

   Men are naturally, while wholly destitute of such influences, not only
   entirely destitute of all inclination to every thing that is truly
   virtuous and holy, but their hearts or wills are obstinately set in
   them to do evil, and they run swiftly on with all their hearts towards
   destruction; and they go on in this course until God changes their
   hearts, by taking away the heart of stone, the obstinate, rebellious
   heart, and giving them a new heart, a humble, obedient heart, and thus
   makes them willing to obey him in the day of his power, or by his
   omnipotent energy on their hearts. And when he has begun this great and
   good work in any whom he pleases, he carries it on until the day of
   Christ, and takes care constantly to grant them that assistance and
   those influences by which he thoroughly and effectually worketh in them
   both to will and to do all those things whereby they work out their own
   salvation, and are prepared to dwell with Jesus Christ in his kingdom
   forever. They receive the spirit of Christ when they first become
   Christians, to be in and dwell with them forever, by whom they are led,
   and who is the author of every holy exercise of heart which they have,
   and of all the good works they do, by which they go on in the way to
   heaven, and until they are made perfectly holy. They being interested
   in the promises of the covenant of grace, their salvation is made sure,
   and God is engaged by promise never to leave them or forsake them, but
   to lead them safely on to glory, and that he will keep them by his
   mighty power, through their faith, by which they shall work out their
   own salvation.

   That God thus works in all true Christians to will and to do all they
   will and do in working out their own salvation, and that they are thus
   wholly dependent on him for every right motion and choice of heart, and
   for every good thing they do, is not only plainly asserted in the words
   of the text, which cannot be understood in any other sense than that
   which has been given of them, without straining and forcing them to
   speak an unnatural sense, but is abundantly confirmed by innumerable
   other passages of scripture, which speak the same language and assert
   the same thing; too many to be rehearsed here, and of which the
   careful, intelligent reader of the Bible cannot be ignorant. And this
   is expressly or implicitly acknowledged by all Christians in their
   prayers, however some professing Christians may in their speculations,
   and even in the feelings and tenor of the exercises of their hearts,
   contradict it.

   4.There appears to be some intended difference between willing and
   doing, when it is said, God worketh in Christians both to will and to
   do. Strictly speaking, men are active in nothing but in the exercise of
   their will, or in willing, and therefore do nothing else: yet the
   effects and consequences of the exertions of their willing, which by
   divine constitution are connected with their acts of will, and their
   voluntary exertions, they are said to do or to be done by them, and are
   considered as in some sense distinct from their volitions; so that,
   when their will is carried into full execution, they may be said to do
   what they willed, and so both to will and to do. And when any thing is
   willed, determined or chosen, which will cannot be immediately put into
   execution, but the act or event willed is future, and at a distance,
   when such a choice is executed and effected, the person thus willing
   has both willed and done the action or event. Thus, when a man wills
   and determines to attend public worship devoutly the next sabbath, or
   to visit one of his neighbours and to give him some salutary advice and
   exhortation, or to give something to the poor, he wills those things;
   but they are not yet done, till by a course of acts of will they
   actually take place and are effected; and then he hath both willed and
   done them. These observations may serve to shew the propriety of the
   distinction in the words before us between willing and doing, and what
   the distinction imports. The Apostle makes this same distinction more
   than once. He says, "To will is present with me; but how to perform
   that which is good, I find not." [Rom. vii. 18.] He found a strong
   desire and inclination to do many good things, and was hearty in
   willing them: but when he came to put what he willed into actual
   execution, he failed of coming up fully to what he willed, and felt the
   necessity that God should work in him both to will and to do; and that
   when he faithfully executed his own will it was owing to the effectual
   grace of God, working in him not only to will, but to do it. He,
   writing to the Corinthians respecting a collection for the poor, says
   to them, "Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
   readiness to will, so there may be a performance also:" [2 Cor. viii.
   11.]

   5. The words which are added, "Of his good pleasure," remain yet to be
   explained. The meaning appears to be, that God worketh in men to will
   and to do as it pleases him, in the exercise of his sovereign goodness,
   who hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he
   hardeneth. In the beginning of this work, he chooses whom he will to be
   the subjects of it, not being under obligation to any; who are all
   wholly gone out of the way, their hearts being set against God, and
   every thing which has the nature of holiness. God waits not to have
   them turn and will that which is right, for this they would never do,
   if left to themselves, whatever means are used, and motives set before
   them, to persuade them to it. He first begins, and gives them a new
   heart, and creates them in Christ Jesus unto good works, and works in
   them to will and to do. Thus, not by works of righteousness which they
   had done (for they were dead in trespasses and sins, altogether
   rebellious) but according to his mercy, he saved them, by the washing
   of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; and being thus made
   willing by the powerful operation of God on their hearts, according to
   his sovereign good pleasure; and having begun the good work, and they
   being brought into that covenant, according to which he has in his
   sovereign grace promised to carry it on till it is completed; be
   worketh in them to will and to do, so as to insure and perfect their
   salvation, in that manner and degree which is according to his
   sovereign good pleasure.

   The next thing proposed is,

   IV. To consider the force of the argument by which the foregoing
   exhortation is urged, or the reason given why Christians should work
   out their own salvation with fear and trembling, introduced and denoted
   by the particle For. "For it is God which worketh in you, both to will
   and to do, of his good pleasure."

   In order to set this in the true and best light, what has been before
   observed must be kept in view, viz. that the design and force of the
   exhortation is not merely or chiefly to work out their own salvation,
   but to do this in a particular way and manner, with fear and trembling.
   They began to work out their own salvation when the Apostle was with
   them, and had made great progress in this work, after he had left them;
   and he now enjoins upon them to go on in this great work, with fear and
   trembling, with self-diffidence, in a sense of their own insufficiency,
   and their constant absolute dependence on God; with humility and
   poverty of spirit, and all those feelings and exercises which are
   implied in this.

   And he urges this upon them with this good and forcible reason, "For it
   is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good
   pleasure." You have no sufficiency of your own to do or will any thing
   right, but are always and entirely dependent on God, who is the author
   of every choice and exertion by which you are enabled to proceed in the
   Christian life, who is above all controul, and acts as an absolute
   sovereign in this matter. And without him you can do nothing.

   The sense of this passage of scripture, as it has been now explained,
   may be expressed in the following words.

   "My beloved fellow Christians, as you gave up yourselves to Jesus
   Christ, to obey and serve him, when I was present with you, and have
   since, in my absence, continued and made great advances in your
   obedience, I earnestly exhort you to go on in your Christian course
   with that holy fear and trembling which implies a sense of the
   difficulty, greatness and importance of the work which is before you,
   keeping in view the eternal happiness and glory which the gospel sets
   before you, and the infinite evil that awaits all who come short,
   together with a constant conviction of your utter moral weakness and
   insufficiency for this work, and your entire and constant dependence on
   God for his powerful assistance in every step you take; so that if he
   should leave you to yourselves, you would certainly come short and
   perish. Be on your constant guard against the least confidence and
   trust in yourselves; be not high minded, because you have been thus
   distinguished, and have continued in your obedience, making advances in
   the Christian life; but fear: be humble, and, in a constant sense of
   your own utter insufficiency, to do the least thing towards your
   salvation of yourselves, put your whole trust in God at all times for
   his constant influence and help, by which alone you will be able to
   work out your own salvation.

   "This caution and exhortation to go on in your Christian course with
   this fear and trembling is proper and important, as it is natural to
   man to be high minded, and to trust in himself; and even Christians,
   through their remaining depravity, are in danger of a criminal degree
   of this, in a measure, forgetting their own weakness and insufficiency
   and dependence on God, by which they greatly injure themselves; and
   because thus to fear and tremble is essential to the life of a
   Christian, and cannot be exercised in too high a degree: for the more a
   Christian has of this, the more beautiful and perfect is his character,
   and he will work out his own salvation with greater safety, strength
   and activity. And there is the highest reason and the strongest motive
   for Christians to work out their own salvation with this fear and
   trembling, to which I am exhorting, because they are in fact thus
   entirely and always dependent on God for every right motion of their
   heart, and all they do in this work, as all they will and do is the
   effect of a divine operation effectually working in them both to will
   and do, and that of his sovereign good pleasure, and entirely
   independent of them."

   The Apostle exhorts them to maintain a humbling sense of their
   depravity, moral weakness, and utter insufficiency to the work in which
   they were engaged, and had made considerable progress, and their entire
   dependence on God for every right exercise of heart; to remember and
   realize that all they had attained to in the Christian life was to be
   ascribed to God working in them to will and to do it; and that they
   were still thus dependent on him for every right choice and action; so
   that if God should cease to work in them both to will and to do, they
   would immediately fall away and perish.

   The Apostle was sensible of the disposition in man to overlook his
   dependence on God every moment for every right motion of his will; and
   to trust in himself, relying on his own strength and sufficiency: and
   he knew how fatal this disposition was to the souls of men, if it were
   not counteracted and mortified; and that Christians had need to be
   reminded of this. He therefore warns the Christians at Philippi to
   avoid this fatal rock; and at the same time marks out the only true and
   safe way to heaven. And happy would it have been for many professing
   Christians since, if they had attended to, understood and conformed to
   this apostolic direction; who, contrary to this, have thought
   themselves something when they were nothing, and have attempted to work
   out their own salvation in their own strength, relying on their own
   sufficiency to will and to do; and consequently never have willed and
   done any thing right, and really holy, but have perished in the
   foolish, presumptuous attempt.

   Having attempted to explain these words under the four preceding heads,
   as was proposed, we come now,

   Fifthly. To improve the subject to practical purposes.

   I. From the explanation which has been given of this important passage
   of scripture, if it be in any measure just and night, we learn that
   many have overlooked the true sense of these words, have put a wrong
   meaning upon them, and perverted them to very bad purposes.

   They are such who assert man's sufficiency to work out his own
   salvation of himself, without any distinguishing, efficacious
   influences of the Spirit of God, effectually working in him both to
   will and to do all that is necessary for his salvation; and deny that
   man is absolutely and wholly dependent on God in working out his own
   salvation: but hold that he who does this distinguishes himself
   independent of God's assistance, of which he has no more than they have
   who do not work out their own salvation. They who espouse and contend
   for this sentiment, are wont to appeal to the first words of the
   passage before us, "Work out your own salvation;" and think this
   sufficiently supports their cause, and asserts that men are, of
   themselves, to work out their own salvation, independent of any
   internal divine influence on their hearts effectually to will and to
   do. At the same time they wholly overlook the following words; or, if
   they are urged against them, they put an unnatural and forced meaning
   upon them, which has been shewn cannot be the meaning, in the foregoing
   explanation.

   Thus this text is wholly perverted to support and establish a doctrine
   which has a most pernicious and destructive tendency, is contrary to
   the whole tenor of scripture, and directly contrary to this very text,
   taken together, and rightly understood; which, it is thought, clearly
   appears from the foregoing explanation. This is a most dangerous and
   destructive perversion of scripture; for every one who believes in his
   heart he is so sufficient to work out his own salvation, and to
   distinguish himself from those who neglect to do this, without any
   distinguishing influences of the Spirit of God, working in him both to
   will and to do, and thinks he is thus by his own self-sufficiency
   actually working out his own salvation, is deceiving himself, and
   trusting in man, and making flesh his arm; he is therefore accursed,
   and will sink into destruction. How lamentable that such doctrine
   should be advocated by any, yea, by so many! How unhappy that such
   multitudes should, through the moral blindness, selfishness and pride
   of their hearts, be led astray by these false teachers! Surely the
   blind are leading the blind, and they both will fall into the ditch of
   endless destruction!

   There have been those who have understood these words as a direction to
   unrenewed sinners to begin and work out their own salvation, enforced
   with a strong encouragement, if not a promise, that if they thus set
   out in earnest, and do what is called their part, God will give them
   all needed assistance to go on so as to obtain salvation, or do his
   part. This they understand by his working in them both to will and to
   do. Thus, according to them, God waits to have them set out and begin
   to will and to do; and then he sets in to assist them to go on. It is
   sufficient to shew every considerate person, surely, that to put such a
   meaning on these words is wholly to pervert them, only to mention it.
   The words are spoken to Christians, in whom God had already begun a
   good work, by working in them to will and to do, and who had made great
   progress in the Christian life. And what he teaches them is their own
   insufficiency to will and to do, and that they did not begin in this
   work till God first wrought in them both to will and to do; nor go one
   step without his efficacious agency on their hearts; and therefore they
   ought to maintain a humbling sense of this on their minds, and put
   their whole trust in God, who only can work in them to will and to do
   that by which they must work out their own salvation. To apply these
   words to sinners, to encourage them to a proud conceit of their own
   moral strength and sufficiency, and to trust in themselves to work out
   their own salvation, is as direct and gross a perversion of them as can
   well be imagined.

   There are others, who, though they have rightly considered the
   exhortation in the text to be addressed to Christians, yet have
   mistaken the proper meaning and force of the exhortation, of fear and
   trembling, and of the reason given by which the exhortation is urged;
   and therefore have overlooked the true sense of the text, and really
   perverted it. Without attending to the true, or any precise and
   determinate meaning of fear and trembling, they consider the
   exhortation to Christians to work out their own salvation, as directing
   them to do what they call their part, which they are to perform,
   without taking any notice of the manner in which they are exhorted to
   do it; and consequently represent God's working in them to will and to
   do, rather as the consequence of their working, in which he will assist
   them in their endeavors to work out their own salvation: so that the
   meaning of these words, according to them, is this: Work out your own
   salvation, do your part, for then and on this condition God will do his
   part, and work in you both to will and to do.

   He who has attended to and understood the explanation of these words
   which has been attempted in the preceding discourses, and approves of
   it, must be sensible that the above representation of the meaning of
   the text wholly overlooks the true design and force of it, and is a
   total perversion of it, and may justly be said to "darken counsel by
   words without knowledge."

   On the whole, it appears that they who attend only to the first part of
   the passage which has been explained, as exhorting men to work out
   their own salvation, without bringing into view the following words,
   not attending to the words fear and trembling, as expressing the manner
   in which this work is to be done, or giving a wrong sense to them, have
   not given the true import and force of the exhortation, and have not
   improved it to promote the purpose designed by it; and many have in
   this way perverted it to establish delusion and falsehood. And, that
   they also who have attended to the last words, "For it is God which
   worketh in you both to will and to do," without attending to their
   connection with the foregoing exhortation, and the true meaning of fear
   and trembling, and the force of the reason and argument from thence,
   expressed in the particle For, have, at best, not given the true and
   important meaning of the whole passage; and have overlooked the design
   and force of it, and the most interesting and practical truths
   contained in it; if they have not improved it to promote error and
   delusion.

   In short, this text cannot be understood, unless it be considered in
   the connection of each part of it, and in the true meaning of every
   expression and word contained in it. But when this is done with proper
   care and judgment, it will be found to be clear, easy, consistent, and
   harmonious, and to exhibit true religion, both in theory and practice,
   and the real character of a Christian, as distinguished from all
   counterfeits.

   In this view, the preceding particular explanation has been attempted,
   and is to be yet further improved.

   II. From this passage of scripture, as it has been explained, several
   doctrines are expressed or implied, and the objections which have been
   made to them appear to be wholly without foundation, and very
   unreasonable. Some of these will be particularly mentioned and
   considered.

   1. As God is here said to produce every good volition and exercise in
   the Christian by which he works out his own salvation, it has been
   objected, that according to this the work is all done by God, and not
   by the Christian, which renders the text, taken together, wholly
   inconsistent and absurd; as if it were said, "Work out your own
   salvation; but at the same time remember that you can do nothing, and
   really have nothing to do; for it is God who must do all, by producing
   the will and the deed!"

   The mere mentioning of this objection is sufficient to expose the
   unreasonableness and absurdity of it. If God works in them to will and
   to do, then they both will and do; and this is as much their own will
   and deed, as much their own exertion and work, as it could be were
   there no previous exertion of God, as necessary in order to their thus
   willing and doing. Christians do nothing in working out their own
   salvation till they begin to will and act; and when they do this, it is
   as much their own act and deed, as in the nature of things any thing
   that is willed and done can be, whatever God may do in working in them
   thus to will and to do. The latter is the work of God, and not theirs,
   the former is as much their own exertion and work, as if God did
   nothing in them, and is entirely distinct from what God does. Their own
   exertions, their willing and doing, in working out their own salvation,
   are as necessary as if they were independent of God, and he did not
   work in them to will and to do: and therefore this is no reason why
   they should not will and work, but sit still and do nothing; but is a
   good reason why they should work, and do what they do with fear and
   trembling, not trusting in themselves, but in God alone, to enable them
   to go through and perfect this work.

   2. This doctrine of absolute dependence on God for every volition and
   exertion in working out our own salvation, which is implied and
   asserted in the explanation which has been given of this text, has been
   represented and objected to as a very discouraging doctrine, tending to
   lead persons to sit still, and not attempt to do any thing towards
   their salvation.

   It is granted that the view of the text which has been given does tend
   to discourage persons from attempting to work out their own salvation
   in their own strength and sufficiency, independent of God, and his
   effectual operation on their hearts to will and to do; and will
   effectually do it, where it has its proper influence on the hearts of
   men. But this affords no real ground of objection to the doctrine, but
   is rather in favour of it. It is necessary that men should be
   discouraged from working out their salvation in this way, and
   relinquish it, in order to their being saved; and the sooner and more
   thoroughly they are discouraged, the better. Such discouragement is
   indeed given in the text, and in a vast number of other passages in the
   Bible, being rightly understood; for men are every where in scripture
   represented as wholly dependent on God for the effectual influences of
   the Holy Spirit in order to do that which is necessary to be done by
   them for their salvation.

   But to him who feels his own moral depravity and utter insufficiency to
   will and do any thing by which he may be saved, without the powerful
   operations of God to work in him to will to do it, this doctrine will
   open the only ground of hope and encouragement to do or attempt to do
   any thing. If a child or any person were called to do some great thing,
   to which he knew he was wholly unequal, being utterly insufficient to
   such a work of himself, he would not have any courage to attempt it,
   until he knew that one stood by him who was able and promised to give
   him all necessary assistance, if he would rely wholly on him for it;
   but this would give him sufficient encouragement to engage in the work
   with hope of success; and would be the only ground of encouragement and
   hope.

   Jesus Christ said to his disciples, "Without me ye can do nothing."
   Surely he did not say this to discourage them and lead them to sit
   still and do nothing; but to encourage them to trust in him, and to
   engage in the work assigned to them with alacrity, courage, and hope.
   The apostle Paul knew that he was what he was by the grace of God,
   working mightily and effectually in him both to will and to do; that he
   had no sufficiency of himself for any good thing, but that all his
   sufficiency was of God; that without the powerful assistance of Christ
   he could do nothing. Did this discourage him, from attempting to do any
   thing? No; directly the contrary: from this he took his sole
   encouragement, and was animated to pursue his work with activity and
   diligence, and laboured more than all the other apostles, knowing that,
   through Christ who strengthened him, he could do all things.

   Thus it appears not only that the objection under consideration is
   altogether without any ground or reason, but that it is made against a
   passage of scripture which, according to the explanation which has been
   given, affords the only ground of hope to sinners, and gives sufficient
   and the only encouragement to work out our own salvation with fear and
   trembling; and which does contain a complete answer to the objection,
   and that it is as direct, great and mischievous a perversion and abuse
   of the text, as can be imagined. Let it therefore be rejected by all
   with abhorrence, and silenced forever.

   3. The objection which has been made, that this doctrine of man's
   dependence on the powerful operation of God for every virtuous and holy
   act of will, so that it is really produced by him, and could not exist
   did not God work in him both to will and to do, is inconsistent with
   human liberty, and makes man a mere machine, who is acted upon in all
   he wills and does, is really answered and refuted in the words
   themselves, as they have been explained.

   Human liberty consists in willing and doing, or in acting voluntarily.
   To act freely, and to act voluntarily, are synonimous terms, meaning
   the same thing; and it is impossible to exercise or conceive of any
   other real liberty than this. All the liberty of any moral agent
   consists in acting voluntarily. There is no other liberty in nature
   possible. Therefore, liberty does not consist in any thing which takes
   place before the actual exertion of willing; man does not, he cannot,
   exercise freedom antecedent to his acting voluntarily, or when he
   ceases to will and to do. Therefore, when God worketh in men to will
   and do what otherwise they would not will and do, their liberty is so
   far from being obstructed by this, that it is promoted, and the
   consequence is, their actually willing and doing, and, consequently
   exercising all the liberty of which any creature is or can be made
   capable. How groundless and unreasonable then is this objection! It
   amounts to this, that man cannot be free in that which is the only
   exercise of liberty, because he never would have acted thus freely in
   that instance, did not God by working in him, induce him to exercise
   all the freedom of which he is capable in actually willing and doing.

   It is evident that many puzzle and bewilder themselves about human
   liberty, and think many facts and doctrines contained in the Bible to
   be inconsistent with liberty; or at least confess themselves unable to
   conceive how they can be consistent with it, because they have never
   attended so much to the nature of human liberty as to be able to
   determine precisely in what it does consist, and imagine it consists in
   something of which they have no clear and consistent idea, and which is
   really impossible, and never did or can exist. If they would carefully
   consult their own feelings to find what that is which they feel and
   exercise when they consider themselves perfectly free in what they do,
   they would find that when they acted voluntarily or of choice, and did
   as they pleased, they acted freely, and possessed all the freedom they
   could desire, or have any consistent conception of; therefore, that
   though God work in them to will and to do, or whatever were the
   previous cause of their willing and acting as they did, yet they were
   perfectly free in their choice and conduct; and that it was as much
   their own will and choice, as it could be on any supposition whatever,
   and they themselves wholly accountable for what they will and do.

   This passage therefore is so far from being inconsistent with human
   liberty, that it supposes and asserts that persons have and exercise
   all the liberty in the practice of morality and religion of which man
   is capable, and carries in the face of it a complete confutation of the
   objection under consideration. And let no one imagine he has not all
   the freedom that is desirable, or that, in the nature of things, can be
   possessed and exercised, while he feels and knows that he acts
   voluntarily, or does as he pleases. And if he does both will and do
   that which is really working out his own salvation, let him ascribe it
   wholly to the sovereign mercy of God, who worketh in him thus to will
   and do of his good pleasure.

SERMON XIII.

   Phil. ii. 12, 13. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling:
   for it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good
   pleasure.

   HAVING considered three objections to the text, as it has been
   explained in the preceding discourse, it is proposed in this to answer
   several more.

   4. It is objected, that if men are not and cannot be willing to work
   out their own salvation, unless God first work in them to will and to
   do, then they cannot be blamable for not willing and doing.

   To this objection there is a full solution and answer in the words to
   which it is made. If none do any thing towards working out their own
   salvation, till God worketh in them to will and to do, this supposes
   that previous to this they are unwilling; and that this unwillingness,
   or opposition of will to this work, is the only difficulty in the way
   of their willing and doing that by which they would be saved; and were
   it not for this opposition of heart or will to do that by which they
   would be saved, there would be no need that God should thus work in
   them to will and to do, which otherwise they voluntarily refuse to do.
   It is therefore supposed that they act freely in willing and doing that
   which is contrary to working put their salvation, and consequently that
   they are wholly blamable for voluntarily opposing that by which they
   might be saved, if they were willing to comply with it. For we have no
   other idea of blame or crime, but that which consists in willing and
   doing that which is contrary to reason and truth, and the command of
   God, when nothing is in the way of willing and doing that which is
   right and wise, but their unwillingness or opposition of heart or will
   to that which is required. And the greater the degree of opposition of
   will there is to that which is right and good, and the stronger the
   propensity and inclination is to the contrary, the more blameable and
   guilty such persons appear to be to all who exercise reason or common
   sense. And the more fixed in the strong and constant opposition of
   their hearts they are to that which is wise and good, and propensity to
   do evil, so that they are perfectly deaf to all warnings and counsels
   and motives which can be set before them to choose and do that which is
   right, and would make them happy, and they cannot be reclaimed by any
   means whatsoever that can be used with them; the more odious and
   blameworthy they are, according to the feelings, judgment and consent
   of all.

   If a child be disobedient to his parents, and wholly refuses to pay any
   respect to them and regard their dictates, the more obstinate he
   appears to be, and fixed in his rebellion, under all possible means
   used with him to reclaim him, this is so far from being any excuse, or
   extenuation of his blame or guilt, that, it is considered by all,
   unless it be those who are joined with him in the same disobedience, as
   an aggravation of his guilt. Whoever thought of excusing a murderer or
   thief, and could think him blameless or the less guilty, because he had
   long persisted in his evil practices, and could not be reclaimed by all
   the persuasions, threats and severe corrections which could be
   administered or devised? Can any one avoid thinking him the worse, and
   more odious and blameable, the more his inclination to murder or steal
   is proved to be fixed and incurable? It is possible the person himself
   might plead this as an excuse; and his companions in the same
   wickedness might join with him in exculpating him and themselves,
   because they had such a strong inclination to persist in their
   practices, and were so utterly averse from a reformation, and so far
   from having the least disposition to any thing of the kind, that they
   could not be willing to hearken to advice, and reform. But all who are
   not murderers nor thieves would consider their attempting to make such
   an excuse as an aggravation of their crimes, and an increase of their
   blameworthiness.

   This is applicable to the case before us, and may serve to illustrate
   it. Mankind are all rebels against God, and are sunk into total moral
   depravity, in which they have a strong, fixed and incurable propensity
   to rebellion, and a proportionable aversion from God and holiness, and
   will not come to Christ that they might be saved. This depravity and
   obstinacy is incurable, that is, by any thing in themselves; for their
   whole inclination, and all their exertions, are an opposition to
   turning to God, or a willingness to embrace the gospel; it is incurable
   by any means that can be used with them, or by any thing that can be
   done for them by any creature. The removal of this rebellious
   disposition is infinitely out of the reach of the power of men or
   angels. He only can do it who created all things, and is able to take
   away the hard, obstinate heart, and give an obedient one, and work in
   men to will and to do that to which they are naturally totally averse.
   Nothing is or can be in the way to prevent any persons being willing to
   embrace the gospel, but a contrary will and choice, and aversion of
   heart from Jesus Christ and the gospel. And if this be not in the
   nature of it criminal, and blameable in every degree of it, then there
   can be no such thing as blame or crime in nature. And if the strong
   degree of opposition to that which is right and wise, and inclination
   to the contrary so as to render it incurable, in the sense explained,
   does render the person innocent; then every the least degree of such
   inclination is not criminal, so there can be no such thing as sin;
   unless men can sin without any inclination to sin, and may incur blame
   when they exercise no choice.

   All this is supposed and really asserted in our text: That mankind are
   wholly and obstinately opposed in their will and affections to that
   which is right and wise, and necessary to be chosen, in order to their
   salvation; that this is the only and all the difficulty in the way of
   their salvation, and is the only thing which renders it necessary that
   God should powerfully work in them to make them willing to embrace the
   way of salvation. The objection is therefore contrary to the passage
   objected to, which when considered contains a full answer to it, and
   the objection appears not to have the lead foundation, if all blame
   consists wholly in having no inclination to that which is right and
   wise, and in an inclination and choice which is directly contrary: and
   nothing can be blameable but this: and the stronger this inclination
   is, and the more there is of it, the more and greater is the guilt;
   which no man can deny without contradicting the plainest dictates of
   reason and common sense.

   When it is said in the objection, that if men cannot embrace the gospel
   unless God work in them to will and do it, this must render them
   blameless, if by this any difficulty is designed to be expressed which
   does not wholly consist in their unwillingness to this, and is not the
   same with their will not, it is not true that they cannot; for, as has
   been observed, there can be no other bar in the way of their embracing
   the gospel, but a fixed opposition of will to it; and this is supposed
   and even asserted in the text, as nothing else or more is necessary to
   work out their salvation but a will to do it. And when it is said they
   cannot be willing, the meaning is, that they are wholly destitute of
   the least inclination or real desire to comply, and have such a strong,
   fixed opposition of will to it, that they cannot be willing to embrace
   the gospel, such opposition of will being entirely inconsistent with
   it, so long as it continues; and they being without the least
   inclination or desire to remove this opposition, but acquiesce in it
   with all their hearts, it cannot be removed by any thing short of the
   power of God working in them to will and to do. But if this be all that
   the objector means by his cannot, this is so far from being any excuse
   for not being willing to embrace the gospel, that it is the very thing
   in which all blame consists; and the more there is of this will not,
   and the stronger the inclination is to oppose and reject the gospel,
   the greater is the guilt and blameworthiness, as has been before
   observed, and cannot be denied by any who will allow that there is any
   such thing as guilt and blame in nature. In this sense the words of
   Christ are to be understood, when he says, "No man can come to me,
   except the Father who hath sent me draw him:" [John. vi. 44.] The
   Saviour of the world does not say this to excuse men as blameless in
   not coming to him, but rather to express their total depravity and the
   greatness of their guilt, asserting that there is such opposition of
   the will or heart of all men naturally to him, that they are disposed
   to reject the gospel, and, while this is the case, no man can with such
   an heart come to Christ, as this implies a contradiction. And this
   depravity and opposition of heart is so great and fixed, that no man
   will come to him, unless it be removed by the power of God working in
   him to will and do that which he would otherwise continue utterly to
   refuse. That these words are thus to be understood is certain from what
   Christ faith elsewhere on this subject. He said to the Jews, "Ye will
   not come to me, that ye might have life. How can ye believe, who
   receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from
   God only?" In which words he asserts, that the only thing in the way of
   their coming to him was, that it was contrary to their inclination or
   will; and that their inability to believe on him, which is the same
   with coming to him, or the only reason why they could not believe, was
   nothing but an opposite inclination to desire and seek that which was
   contrary to believing on him and coming to him. We are certain that
   Jesus Christ did consider this inability to come to him, though so
   fixed and great that it could not be removed by any power short of that
   Divine Energy which can give a new heart, as any excuse for not coming
   to him; for he asserts their not believing on him and refusing to come
   to him to be the greatest crime, for which they might justly be
   condemned to perish forever. Hear his words. "He that believeth not, is
   condemned already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only
   begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come
   into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their
   deeds were evil. And when he (the Spirit) is come, he will reprove the
   world of sin, because they believe not on me."

   If they who make the objection under consideration would attend to all
   this, and consider it well, they would know that they were as really
   objecting against Jesus Christ himself, as against our text, as it has
   been explained; for he saith the same things in the words which have
   been cited. And they would at the same time be convinced that the
   objection is contrary to all reason and the common sense of mankind,
   and implies the greatest absurdity, and contradiction to all moral
   truth.

   Many bewilder themselves, and put a stumbling block before their faces,
   and make great and hurtful mistakes, by using the words cannot and
   inability in a sense which is inconsistent with blame, and wholly
   excuses for not doing what a person cannot do. That which a person
   cannot do, though ever so much inclined to do it, and however willing
   he is to do it, were it in his power, he cannot be blamed for not
   doing. And this is the sense in which mankind commonly use the words
   cannot and inability. But when these words are used in a moral sense,
   so as to imply no difficulty in complying with what is required, but
   want of an inclination and desire to do it, or an actual opposition of
   will to it, which is quite a different and opposite sense from the
   other; such a want of ability or power to comply with that which is
   reasonable and right, does not excuse a refusal to comply, but
   necessarily implies blame, and the person is criminal in proportion to
   the degree of his inability to comply, or the strength and fixedness of
   the opposition of his heart to that which is required, in which all the
   difficulty of this compliance consists.

   This may be illustrated by the following instance: A poor man, a real
   object of charity, suffering for want of the necessaries of life, who
   must perish soon if he had not speedy relief, begged the compassion and
   help of two neighbours who then were together. One of them was a kind,
   benevolent man, and felt for the sufferer, and ardently wished it were
   in his power to relieve him; but he was poor himself, and had nothing
   to give to his distressed brother. The other was rich, and able
   immediately to help the suffering, perishing man, if he had been
   willing to do it; but he was a stranger to benevolence, and had the
   greatest aversion from giving or doing any thing for the relief of any
   of his fellow-men, and never had felt the least compassion to the
   distressed, or given so much as a penny for the relief of any, though
   he had many opportunities to do it, and not a few had perished by his
   refusing to afford them any help. He therefore in this instance
   hardened his heart, and felt not the least compassion for the perishing
   man, and refused to save this beggar from death, which was in his
   power, had he been willing to give him what he could easily spare.

   Who can avoid pronouncing the former blameless, or considering the
   latter as very criminal and blameworthy? And the farther he was from
   any inclination . to help the distressed, and the more fixed and
   obstinately set he was against giving any thing to the poor, the more
   vile and criminal he must appear to all. The latter cannot be liberal,
   and delight in distributing what he possesses, until he has a new
   heart, and is possessed with a disposition directly contrary to that
   which now governs him in all his thoughts and desires. And his heart is
   wholly and with all its strength opposed to a benevolent, generous
   heart, and therefore he cannot have the least inclination and desire to
   have such a heart, but is entirely satisfied and pleased with his
   present selfish disposition. And if he should pretend to desire and
   attempt to obtain a good, benevolent heart, all his desires and
   attempts would really be nothing but the exercise of his selfishness,
   and the gratification of his evil, covetous disposition; and therefore
   would be nothing but real opposition to a good heart. So that it may be
   truly said of him, he is utterly unable to change his own heart from a
   selfish to a benevolent one. Yet who can think him the less criminal
   and blameable on this account? Must not all look upon him as guilty and
   odious in proportion to the fixed strength of his selfish, cruel
   disposition, and his inability by this to become benevolent and kind?

   The difficulty which is in the way of his helping the poor man may be
   as great, and his inability to do a generous action as real and as much
   insurmountable and immoveable by him, for the reason which has been
   mentioned, as the inability of the former to relieve him. It may be
   said, agreeable to truth, of both of them, that they cannot relieve the
   distressed sufferer. But their inability is so entirely different, and
   of so opposite a nature and kind, that the inability of the former
   excuses, and that of the latter is so far from excusing, that it is the
   very thing in which his crime and blame consists. And they who attend
   to all that has been offered or can be said on this point, and yet will
   not see the difference and opposition between these two kinds of
   inability, but persist in asserting that there is no difference, and
   that they equally render a man blameless for not doing what he is
   unable to do; that the inability of the latter of these two men to
   relieve a distressed person is as blameless and excuseable, as that of
   the former; are not capable of being reasoned with or of making any
   proper use of common sense, which cannot be accounted for but by
   supposing that their inability to see and make this distinction, and
   reason properly upon it, is not owing to any defect in their natural
   capacity and reasoning powers, but to an inclination of heart, or
   propensity of will, which perverts their reason, and shuts their eyes
   against the light of truth, so that they cannot see it, however clearly
   it shines; which is the criminal inability that has been described.

   Every degree of inclination to sin is opposition to the contrary, and
   is a difficulty in the way of a holy inclination and choice; and the
   former necessarily weakens the latter in proportion to the degree of
   it, so that perfect holiness cannot be exercised, so long as any degree
   of the opposite inclination exists. And the difficulty or inability to
   be perfectly holy is greater or less in proportion to the greater or
   less degree of the opposite inclination to sin. This, the apostle Paul
   says, is the case with Christians in this world: "The flesh lusteth
   against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are
   contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye
   would:" [Gal. v. 17.] None will suppose, it is presumed, that the
   Apostle said this to excuse Christians for not being perfectly holy, or
   designed to represent the lusting of the flesh, or inclination to sin,
   as blameless, by saying that they could not do the things that they
   would; for if the lusting of the flesh be not sinful and blameable,
   then there cannot be any such thing as sin or blame. When the Apostle
   says, "Ye cannot do the things that ye would," he does not offer this
   as an excuse for their not doing them; since all the difficulty in the
   way of their doing them was their sin: it was therefore a wholly
   blameable, sinful cannot: it was a difficulty and inability to be
   perfectly holy which was criminal and wholly blameable in every degree
   of it, and that too in proportion to the strength and degree.
   Christians had a degree of holiness which was exercised in opposing all
   sinful inclination, and desiring to be perfectly holy. They would be,
   they had a desire to be, ib holy as to do all the things which were
   required of them in a perfect manner and degree; but a contrary
   propensity to sin still worked in them, and rendered them unable to do
   what they would, so that in every exertion they fell short. This
   therefore was a sinful inability, a cannot wholly blameable; for it
   consisted in their inclination to sin.

   The unregenerate sinner is nothing but flesh, in the Apostle's sense of
   the word here, and in many other places, that is, corrupt human nature.
   All his inclinations and desires are lusts of the flesh, in which there
   is no good thing. This his carnal mind is enmity against God, is not
   subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. He has no inclination
   or desire to be holy, to oppose the carnal mind, which therefore has
   the whole dominion in his heart, and reigns there without controul. The
   difficulty and inability he is under to will and to do that which is
   good is total and complete: and as the Christian cannot do the things
   that he would, cannot be perfectly holy, the sinner cannot have the
   least inclination or desire to be holy, or will and do any thing
   towards his salvation. And as the partial inability in the Christian to
   be perfectly holy is altogether his sin, and consists in it; so the
   total inability to will and to do that which is holy in the sinner is
   all of it his sin, and therefore consists wholly in that which is
   blameworthy. His inability, his cannot, is all sin and nothing else.
   And to offer this as an excuse, as rendering the sinner wholly
   blameless, is so unreasonable, absurd and perverse, that it cannot be
   done by an honest, discerning mind.

   So much has been said in answer to this objection, perhaps too much,
   and some repetitions have been made, it may be too many, because it is
   so much in the mouths of many, originates from delusion, and has a most
   pernicious tendency.

   5. The objection which is often made, that it is unreasonable to
   command or exhort sinners to do that which they have no power to do,
   and cannot do unless assisted and enabled to do it by the Spirit of
   God, appears to be groundless, from our text itself, when rightly
   understood; and is fully refuted in the answer to the last objection.
   When it is well understood what is meant by want of, power to obey what
   is commanded, and comply with the exhortation; that it means nothing
   but want of will, and an opposite inclination; the objection vanishes,
   as nothing to the purpose. It means a want of ability to obey, which is
   itself sin, and that in which blameableness consists, and therefore
   cannot be an excuse for not obeying. Therefore, as this kind of
   inability is only a sinful opposition of heart to that which is right
   and duty, it does not remove or lessen the obligation to obedience and
   to comply with duty. Surely none can think that a person may not with
   reason and propriety be exhorted and commanded to do that which is
   right and his duty, and for his interest to do, merely because he is
   not willing to do it. For if so, then no man may be commanded or
   exhorted to that which he is not inclined or willing to do; which
   denies the existence of any law, except it be a man's own inclination
   and will. If God may not command a creature to do what he is not
   willing to do, there is an end to all divine laws, and moral
   government, and a man's own inclination and will is his only law or
   rule of conduct; consequently there can be no sin, unless it be doing
   that which is contrary to a person's will and choice, which is
   impossible.

   But it may be asked, Where is the propriety of commanding or exhorting
   sinners to do that which they never will do, unless they have a new
   heart given to them by God, and he work in them to will and do it; or
   what end will this answer?

   Reply. The reason and propriety of this has been already shown; and
   that if this were not reasonable and proper, there can be no such thing
   as law and moral government. And this is suited, and even necessary, to
   answer the following ends.

   First. If there were no law and commands, and these were not set before
   sinners, pointing out their duty, and urging them to do what is
   necessary to their salvation, they could not know what the law is, and
   what is their duty, and what is necessary to be done by them in order
   to be saved; which is important and necessary. Without this they would
   not be under advantage to know the character of God, of Jesus Christ,
   nor their own character, nor what they must be and do to be saved. "For
   how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how
   shall they hear without a preacher?"

   Second. If commands and exhortations to obedience were not applied to
   sinners, they would not know that they are sinners, and how depraved
   and corrupt they are, and how opposite their hearts are to the gospel,
   and that they are undone forever, unless sovereign grace give them a
   new heart, and make them willing in the day of divine power; all which
   it is important and even necessary the sinner should know, in order to
   his being saved. The apostle Paul said, "I had not known sin, but by
   the law:" and this is true of every one; for by the law is the
   knowledge of sin. And they cannot know that their hearts are strongly
   opposed to the gospel, the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, until they
   have the offer, and are invited and exhorted to believe on him.

   Third. Therefore the gospel is to be preached to all men, and every man
   is to be instructed, warned and exhorted to believe, that he may escape
   the wrath to come, whether they will hear, or whether they will
   forbear, or refuse to hear. This is the way which God takes to answer
   his wise, benevolent purposes. They to whom he in his wisdom is pleased
   to give a heart to believe, will embrace the gospel, and be saved; and
   under a conviction of their guilty, lost state by nature, and that they
   should have justly perished, had not God given them a heart to believe,
   they will ascribe the whole of their salvation to sovereign grace, and
   give all the glory of it to God forever. They who do not hear and
   embrace the gospel, but, according to the criminal choice of their own
   hearts, reject the great salvation, will perish, under the aggravated
   guilt of slighting Jesus Christ, and abusing his grace and love, and
   will exhibit a striking manifestation of the exceeding, amazing
   depravity and wickedness of the human heart, and of the justice of God
   in their eternal destruction.

   It has been observed, that the text contains an answer to the objection
   now under consideration, and it has been shewn how it is answered. But
   an answer is found in it, in another view of it. The Apostle tells
   Christians that if God did not work in them to will and to do, they
   would not will and do any thing towards their own salvation; and at the
   same time exhorts both to will and to do, and work out their own
   salvation with fear and trembling. This is directly in the face of the
   objection. For though they could have no will to work, unless God gave
   it to them; yet they are exhorted and commanded to be willing and to
   work out their own salvation. Why then may not the sinner, who can have
   no will to do any thing towards his salvation, unless God work it in
   him, be exhorted and commanded to will and to do? Is it possible to
   make any objection to this, which is not really against the exhortation
   in the text?

   6. It may be further objected, that the text, as it has been explained,
   implies the doctrine of the certain perseverance of all true
   Christians, unto eternal life; which doctrine tends to make them who
   think themselves Christians careless about their salvation, and leads
   them to indulge themselves in sin, since, having once believed, they
   shall be saved, whatever life they live.

   Answer. The text, as it has been understood, it is granted, does imply
   the do6lrine of the perseverance of all real Christians: for if they
   depend wholly on God to renew their will to holy exercises, by which
   they are born again, made new creatures, and created in Christ Jesus
   unto good works, there is no reason to think he will forsake such a
   work, and suffer it to come to nothing; as there is an apparent
   inconsistency in this: it may therefore be relied upon as certain, that
   Infinite Wisdom and Unchangeable Power and Goodness never begins this
   great and good work, by which men are brought into a state of
   salvation, and become real friends to God, and are pardoned and have
   his favour, without a design to carry it on till it is completed in
   their perfect holiness and endless happiness, as this work from
   beginning to end depends wholly on him. The contrary supposition
   appears most unreasonable, and unworthy of God, and dishonourable to
   him. Moreover, the expression itself denotes a constant work which God
   is carrying on in Christians, without ceasing or relinquishing it. "It
   is God who worketh in you to will and to do," that is, continually, not
   at one time only, but always, to the end of life. It is not said, God
   did once work in them, or that he did work in them sometimes, but not
   always; but he worketh in you, as being common to all Christians, and
   at all times. And in this view only it can be a reason and
   encouragement to work out their own salvation. with fear and trembling,
   as it has been explained.

   But if the doctrine of the certain perseverance of all true Christians
   to final salvation were not implied in the words of the text, when
   considered alone, yet it is established with the utmost certainty when
   they are viewed in connection with what the Apostle had before said to
   these Christians in this epistle. His words are, "Being confident of
   this very thing, that he who hath begun a good work in you will perform
   it until the day of Jesus Christ:" [chap. i. 5, 6.] The good work is
   that spoken of in the text, by which God was working in them both to
   will and to do. The Apostle, under inspiration, was confident, which
   amounts to a certainty, that wherever he begins this work, he will
   carry it on to perfection, "We therefore may be confident, and certain,
   that wherever God begins to work in men to will and to do that which is
   good and holy, he designs to carry this work en to perfection; that he
   will completely finish what he once begins. And this same truth is
   abundantly asserted, many ways, in the Bible, to which it is needless
   now particularly to attend.

   . It is objected to this doctrine, that it tends to make Christians
   careless, and is a temptation to indulge to sin, seeing, according to
   this doctrine, their salvation is secured to them, let them live as
   they will. An answer to this is found in the words of the text, in
   which this doctrine is contained, as has been shewn: for at the same
   time Christians are told that God had begun a good work in them, which
   he would finish, carrying it on to perfection, they are exhorted to
   work out their salvation with fear and trembling; and that too for this
   very reason, that God was working in them so as effectually to secure
   salvation to them. They are informed that their working out their own
   salvation in this particular manner was as necessary to their
   salvation, as if God did not intend their salvation; that there was no
   other way to be saved; and that God thus working in them both to will
   and to do, with an intention to go on and perfect it, was the only
   encouragement, and a strong and cogent motive, thus to work out their
   own salvation.

   The objection before us is therefore made in direct opposition to the
   words of the text, in which the doctrine of the saints' perseverance is
   improved as a motive to every Christian duty in the practice of real
   holiness: it is therefore impossible to encourage the contrary. This
   apostle always speaks in the same strain. He says of himself, in this
   same epistle, "Not as though I had already attained, either were
   already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for
   which I am also apprehended of Christ Jesus. Reaching forth unto those
   things which are before, I press towards the mark, for the prize of the
   high calling of God in Christ Jesus." The Apostle considered himself as
   apprehended, or laid hold of, by Jesus Christ, when he was converted
   and became a Christian, with intent to keep his hold of him till he had
   brought him to possess the prize of eternal life. This was so far from
   making him careless and inactive in the duties of the Christian life,
   that he improved it as an encouragement and motive to activity, zeal
   and engagedness in running the Christian race, that he might obtain
   perfect holiness, and the prize which his Saviour intended for him, and
   so work out his own salvation, of which he was assured, by what Jesus
   Christ had already done for him by working in him both to will and to
   do those things which accompany salvation, being infallibly connected
   with it. In the same view he writes to the Christians at Thessalonica:
   "Let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of
   faith and love, and for an helmet the hope of salvation. For God hath
   not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
   Christ." Here he writes in the same manner as in our text. He urges
   them to the practice of Christian holiness, from the encouragement and
   motive that God had designed them for salvation, giving them the
   character of his children, by which they were interested in the
   everlasting covenant of grace, by which salvation was insured to them.

   This objection not only has an answer in these, and innumerable other
   passages of scripture, but it is also confuted by the inconsistency and
   unreasonableness of it. It carries this inconsistency in it, that if
   the perseverance of Christians in holiness is made certain by God, on
   whom they depend for it, and he has determined they shall work out
   their own salvation; then it is not necessary that they should live a
   holy life, and work oat their salvation, and they may be saved without
   all this, and however much they neglect their own salvation, and
   indulge themselves in all manner of iniquity: or, if it be made certain
   that they shall persevere in a holy life, that they may be saved, then
   they may as well and certainly be saved without persevering in a holy
   life, and though they fall away into sin: and this will encourage
   Christians not to attempt or desire to persevere in obedience, and to
   live in sin. They who can argue thus have given up the use of reason,
   to embrace the most palpable absurdity.

   The objector also falls into another inconsistency, by supposing that a
   Christian may have assurance that he is a real Christian, and therefore
   shall be saved, when he is so inclined to sin as to prefer living in
   sin and the indulgence of his lusts to a holy life; and that he may
   maintain his assurance, while he neglects religion as a task, and lives
   a careless, wicked life; which is contrary to truth, to scripture, and
   the reason and nature of things. If it were possible that a real
   Christian could be in such a frame, and have such a prevailing
   disposition, and continue in it, it would be impossible that he should
   have any just and well grounded assurance of his being a Christian; for
   he can have no evidence of this, but from a disposition and exercises
   directly contrary to a preference of a life of sin, viz. exercises of
   real holiness, disposing to work out his own salvation with fear and
   trembling. The hypocrite, who has no true grace, may be so deluded as
   to think and presume he is a real Christian, and abuse the doctrine of
   the certain salvation of all who Ire once Christians, to indulge in
   sin, because he has really no love to holiness, and prefers a life of
   sin to the life of a Christian. But it is inconsistent to suppose that
   a real Christian should have or think he has evidence that he is a
   Christian, while he is in a careless frame, and loves the pleasure of
   sin rather than God and holiness.

   The scripture asserts that assurance of being a Christian, and of
   salvation, is to be attained and maintained in no other way but the
   exercise of holiness, and great care and diligence in living a holy
   life. The apostle John says, "My little children, let us not love in
   word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know
   that we are of the truth, and shall allure our hearts before him:" [1
   John, iii. 18, 19.] The apostle Peter exhorts professing Christians to
   take care to live and abound in the exercise of every Christian grace,
   in order to have and maintain an assurance of their real Christianity;
   and concludes with these words: "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give
   diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these
   things ye shall never fall:" [2 Pet. i. 5-10.] This is the scriptural
   way of assurance; and they who think they have an assurance that they
   are Christians in any other way, and from some other proposed evidence,
   are presuming, and deceiving themselves to their own destruction.

   And it must be further observed, that it is not only inconsistent with
   the character of a true Christian at any time to prefer a neglect of
   religion and a living in allowed sin, to a holy life, if the former
   were as sure a way to salvation as the latter; so that an assurance
   that he shall be saved will be no inducement to him to live a careless,
   sinful life: but it is yet a greater inconsistency and contradiction to
   suppose a Christian, in that strong and lively exercise of grace, and
   love of holiness, which always attends a true assurance that he is a
   Christian, and shall be saved, should then and for that reason prefer a
   life of sin to a holy life, and from this assurance be led into sin.
   This is impossible; and directly the reverse is certain, viz. that such
   an assurance is not only accompanied by a strong desire and engagedness
   to live a holy life, as without this there can be no real assurance, as
   has been shown; but the assurance itself will greatly add to the
   strength of desire and engagedness to live a holy life, to the honour
   of God, and for his own comfort, were it not necessary in order to be
   saved.

   There are not only these inconsistencies in the objection, but the
   objector supposes that the true Christian is wholly selfish and
   mercenary in all he does, and is all ways disposed to. prefer a life in
   sin to a holy life, if he may be as sure of his own salvation by living
   in sin, as by the contrary. Therefore, having no true love to God and
   regard for his honour, nor any delight in the law of God, or love of
   holiness for its own sake; if he can obtain a promise that he shall be
   saved, he will have no motive to serve God, or have any concern for his
   character and glory; but will choose to live a life of enmity to God,
   by serving himself and his own lusts. It is certain there never was,
   and never will be, such a real Christian, though thousands have with
   the objector supposed it, and are hoping for heaven by living in the
   exercise of a selfish religion, which is abomination in the sight of
   God, and will certainly lead them to destruction.

   The doctrine of the certain perseverance of all real Christians in a
   life of holiness to salvation, secured to them in the covenant of
   grace, is a comfortable and pleasing doctrine to the true Christian. He
   knows his own insufficiency, and absolute and constant dependence on
   God for all holy exercises and conduct: and. that if God should leave
   him to himself, he should fall into sin and ruin. And when he finds a
   promise in the covenant of grace, that all true Christians shall be
   kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation, and that where
   he has begun a good work in men he will carry it on to the day of
   complete redemption, he lays fast hold of it, as the only ground of
   hope that he shall persevere unto salvation, and would not be without
   it for a thousand worlds. But the self-confident hypocrite, who never
   knew his own heart, but thinks he can stand in his own strength, and
   distinguish himself from others who have the same assistance which he
   has, and by his own exertions embrace the gospel and live a holy life,
   in which he himself, not God, determines whether he shall be saved or
   not, by his own independent obedience, or by the abuse of the
   assistance he has; to such this doctrine is most displeasing, and they
   will oppose it with all their might; because it takes away their god in
   which they trust, their own selves, and makes their salvation
   altogether dependent on God, from first to last. For the same reason
   they oppose the doctrines of the divine decrees and of election, as
   these represent men as wholly dependent on God, especially for
   salvation, as according to this he determines who shall be saved, and
   who shall not, independent of man, according to his own pleasure. This
   is the only reason that can be justly assigned for their displeasure at
   these doctrines, and their opposition to them. And if persons of this
   character do not trust in man, and rely on an arm of flesh, even
   themselves, and that in a matter of the greatest importance and
   magnitude, infinitely more so than their own existence, or any other of
   their concerns, it will be difficult, yea, impossible, to conceive what
   is meant by trusting in man. How is it possible then that they should
   escape the awful curse pronounced by God? "Thus faith the Lord, cursed
   be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm:" [Jer. xvii.
   5.]

   7. It is objected, that these doctrines, of man's entire dependence on
   God in doing any thing towards his own salvation, of election, and the
   certain perseverance of all true Christians, if they be true, had
   better not be preached, since they will not be understood by people in
   general, and are very offensive to many, by which they are prejudiced
   against religion; and by many who believe them, are abused to very bad
   purposes; and, on the whole, do much more hurt than good.

   Answer. This objection is really against the Bible itself; and
   particularly against the text we are considering, in which these
   doctrines are all either expressed or implied, as has been shown.
   Therefore the whole Bible, and more especially our text, are to be
   adduced as containing a complete answer.

   If these doctrines are not to be preached, inculcated or mentioned, why
   are they contained in the Bible? Why has God published them to the
   world? If the preaching of these doctrines tends to do hurt, then their
   being published in the Bible, which is to be read by all, has an evil
   tendency. They who make this objection, who are not a few, would drop
   it immediately, if they have any proper regard for the Bible, as it is
   levelled against divine revelation, and the Author of it.

   If these doctrines be not understood by any preachers or hearers, this
   must be their own fault; for nothing is revealed which may not be
   understood, so far as it is revealed, by the honest, attentive reader
   of the Bible, in the assiduous use of all the helps in his reach. And
   if they be not understood, the fault must be in the hearer or the
   preacher, or perhaps in both.

   That these doctrines are improved to increase the prejudices of many
   against religion, and are abused by others to evil purposes, is no
   reason why they should not be taught, explained and vindicated; since
   this is an equal reason why none of the important truths of the Bible
   should be taught; for there is no truth in divine revelation which is
   not liable to abuse, and has not been abused by men, to their own hurt.
   It is no new thing for men to pervert the writings of inspiration to
   their own destruction. Shall they therefore be laid aside, and not
   studied and inculcated? Let the objector judge.

   Let who will think these truths to be of little consequence, and not
   suitable to be maintained and preached, or doubt or disbelieve them, or
   abuse them to the worst purposes: yet they remain highly important and
   useful. They have been found to be so, by thousands and millions. And
   the heart of every true Christian is formed upon them, or agreeable to
   them, whatever his speculations may be. And there is no other way to
   heaven than that which is marked out in our text. This leads to the
   next head of improvement.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XIV.

   Phil. ii. 12, 13. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling:
   for it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good
   pleasure.

   III. THIS subject is to be improved in a use of Examination.

   This is the most important and useful part of the subject to which we
   have attended. The text, as it has been considered and opened, and
   vindicated from objections, points out the only way to heaven, and
   exhibits the true character of every real Christian; and teaches with
   what views, exercises and efforts he must work out his own salvation.
   But all this will be in vain to us, if we do not apply it to ourselves,
   and in this light examine and try ourselves, whether we be real
   Christians, according to this description of a Christian, and walking
   in the narrow way to heaven.

   They who are sincerely desirous to know their own state and character,
   and to determine from the best evidence whether they be real Christians
   or not, may be assisted in this most important inquiry, by attending to
   the following particulars.

   1. Have you ever been convinced, and have you a clear, constant and
   growing conviction, of your utter insufficiency to will and do any good
   tiling, unless God work in you to will and to do; by reason of the
   natural depravity of your hearts, by which you were, in a moral sense,
   dead in trespasses and sins? that if you should be left to yourselves,
   to follow your own will and choice, without the powerful, regenerating
   influences of the Spirit of God, you should certainly run on to
   destruction; and are therefore wholly dependent on God for every right
   motion of will, and all that which is right and good in you; even on
   his sovereign, undeserved grace? The Christian has a clear and powerful
   conviction of this in his own mind continually, and daily acknowledges
   it to God, and increases in a sense of the depravity of his own heart,
   and his constant dependence on God for divine influences to work in him
   every right motion of heart; and a view and sense of this truth attends
   all his exercises and conduct. And while he feels his constant
   dependence on God to will and do any thing that is right, he acquiesces
   in it, and humbly trusts in God, and cries to him for his assistance
   and grace.

   Herein lies the foundation of the first and great difference between a
   true Christian and those who are not so. The latter are strangers to
   this conviction and feeling, and, whatever their speculations may be,
   it they do or attempt any thing in religion, they do it in their own
   strength, and feel as if they had some sufficiency of their own to do
   good, and were not wholly dependent on God for every right motion of
   heart, or exercise of will.

   2. Do you feel a constant and cordial conviction that you are wholly
   blameable for the want of a disposition to will and do that which is
   necessary for your salvation, and for all opposition of will to this,
   that your insufficiency to work out your own salvation, and dependence
   on God to work in you to will and to do it, is no excuse for your not
   doing it; but that your want of a will to do it, and all opposite
   inclination, is altogether your own. fault. Are you willing to be
   looked upon in this light, and disposed to confess this as your sin,
   and humble yourself in the sight of God for every thing in your heart
   and life which is not conformable to the holy law of God? It cannot be
   reasonably supposed that a true Christian, who has been convinced of
   his own sinfulness by an acquaintance with the law, and is a hearty
   friend to it, as perfectly right and good; who is a friend to Christ,
   who has obeyed this law, and died on the cross to magnify it and make
   it honourable, and to save his people from their sins -, that such an
   one should not condemn himself for every thing in his heart and life
   which in the least deviates from this law, and is not a perfect
   conformity to it: for not to do this is inconsistent with his character
   as a Christian.

   3. When you are most attentive to, and feelingly sensible of, your own
   weakness and insufficiency, and of your dependence on God in the sense
   above described, is this lb far from discouraging you, and disposing
   you to sit still and do nothing, that then you have the most ardent
   desires, and the greatest courage, zeal and engagedness to prosecute
   and go through the work of a Christian, and work out your own
   salvation? This, which has been the matter of discouragement,
   uneasiness and objection to multitudes, has a directly contrary
   influence with the Christian, and opens the only way in which he can
   have hope, and by it he is animated with zeal and courage to run the
   Christian race; and what others cannot feel to be consistent, or be
   pleased with, is to him plain and easy, and most satisfactory and
   pleasing, as most suited to glorify God, and promote the humility,
   holiness and happiness of man. In this view, and in this way only, the
   gospel is to the Christian the wisdom of God and the power of God.
   Agreeable to this St. Paul says, "When I am weak, then am I strong." "I
   can do all things through Christ who. strengtheneth me." That is. When
   I have the greatest sense of my own weakness, and insufficiency to the
   work before me, I feel the greatest strength and courage by trusting in
   the grace and power of Christ; I am then strong in the Lord, and in the
   power of his might, and can with courage undertake and go through the
   most difficult and arduous work.

   4. Are you influenced to will and do, and quickened and excited to
   religious exercises, in such a way and manner as naturally leads you to
   be sensible that these things take place by the grace and assistance of
   God, so that you are disposed to ascribe all to him, and not to
   yourselves? Do your own feelings and experience witness to your own
   mind that "It is not of him who willeth, nor of him who runneth, but of
   God, who sheweth mercy?" It is doubtless God's way so to work in
   Christians by his Spirit as to lead them to be sensible that all
   originates from him, and to acknowledge him lo be the worker of all
   good in them. And they can from their own experience adopt the words of
   Paul, and say, "By the grace of God I am what I am."

   5. Are you indeed doing the work of a Christian, working out your own
   salvation, in any measure in the manner which has been described? Do
   you make religion, and the service of Jesus Christ and his interest,
   your great and really your only business? And do you make any progress,
   and abound more and more?

   The real Christian is painfully sensible that he fails and comes
   unspeakably short in every thing, which he knows is to be attributed to
   his own depravity and the sin which dwelleth in him, so that when he
   would do good, evil (sin) is present with him, and the good which he
   would he does not. And this sinful defect, and the evil which attends
   him in all he does, is a grievous burden, and matter of constant
   humiliation before God. And the more the Christian does, and the more
   zeal and engagedness he has in religion, the more sensible he is of his
   sinful defects; therefore this increasing sensibility is no evidence
   that he is not working out his own salvation with fear and trembling,
   but on the contrary is a sign that he is a real Christian, and is
   willing and working. They who do the least, or rather nothing at all,
   in this work of a Christian, are commonly most insensible of their
   defects, and are disposed to think they are doing much, and have few or
   no painful defects to lament.

   But though every Christian comes so lamentably short of what he ought,
   and heartily desires and wishes to do, which is matter of constant
   shame and humiliation; yet he is really working out his own salvation,
   in the manner which has been described in the preceding discourses, and
   is making this work his only business. And he must be supposed to gain
   skill and strength to prosecute this work, and grow in grace and in the
   knowledge of his Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the longer he is in the
   Christian school, and is going in the way to heaven. He therefore who
   is not in some good measure diligent in this business, and fervent in
   spirit, serving the Lord, is not stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding
   in the work of the Lord, has no reason to think he has ever entered
   upon this work, or knows what it is to live the life of a Christian.

   6. Do you live a life of prayer? The Christian, who is working out his
   own salvation with fear and trembling, feeling his own insufficiency,
   and constant dependence on God to work in him to will and to do, and
   having a lively sensibility of his dangerous situation, surrounded with
   numerous subtil, potent enemies, who are seeking his ruin, and beset
   with various and strong temptations to turn aside, and offend God; and
   that he shall inevitably fall into destruction, unless God prevent it
   by his constant influences and sovereign grace; is constantly looking
   to God for safety and help, and expressing his only hope and trust in
   him, praying with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, watching
   thereunto with all perseverance. He will earnestly cry to him for his
   direction and assistance, in every exigence and at all times, and call
   upon the name of the Lord as long as he lives.

   A child on the side of a tremendous precipice, depending on his father
   to guide him in every step, and hold him up by his hand, by which alone
   his fall and being dashed to pieces can be prevented, would keep his
   eye constantly on his father, and cry to him to help him from falling,
   and conduct him safe through all the dangers with which he feels
   himself surrounded. Or should a child be in the midst of a wilderness
   with his father, filled with fierce beasts of prey, ready to devour
   him, while he is without any strength to defend himself, and knows not
   one step of the way to a place of safety, and feels that if he should
   be a minute without the help and guidance of his father, he should run
   directly into the mouth of some savage beast, or turn aside from the
   only way to escape death, he would constantly cry to his father for
   help and protection, who alone could save him. And if his father should
   be out of his fight but a few minutes, what a cry would he raise after
   him! and never cease till he got hold of his father's hand.

   And shall not the Christian, who feels himself in circumstances of
   which those of the child now described are but a very faint
   representation, being infinitely more important and affecting, cry
   night and day unto his God and only Saviour, for help, succour and
   deliverance! Surely he will constantly with cheerfulness obey his
   invitation and command, as not only his duty but his greatest
   privilege, while he hears him saying, "Look unto me, my spouse, from
   the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards: Call upon me in
   the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me:
   Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall
   be opened unto you: Pray always, and faint not: Pray without ceasing,"
   &c. And the more he loves God, and the stronger is his faith and trust
   in him, and his confidence in the certain and punctual fulfilment of
   all his promises, the more hearty, earnest and fervent his prayers will
   be; for in this way. he will express a sense of his dependence on God,
   and his love to him, and faith and trust in his promises.

   The nominal Christian, who has no proper sense of his dependence on
   God, as it has been explained, but feels himself in a, great measure
   sufficient to the work of a Christian, and has no real love to God, or
   trust in his promises, and dependence upon him, to work all his works
   in him, both to will and to do. can live without much prayer from day
   to day; or, if he pray, it will be but a formal, cold business, in
   which there is no engagedness or heart. But this is not the character
   of a true Christian, who is working out his own salvation. with fear
   and trembling, knowing that it is God who worketh in him both to will
   and to do. He casteth all his care upon God, and in every thing by
   prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, makes known his requests
   unto God. Believing that they have a Great High Priest, who is in
   heaven, Jesus the Son of God; they come boldly, with the utmost freedom
   of access and of speech, unto the throne of grace, that they may obtain
   mercy, and find help in time of need.

   7. Have you, after you have done all, no reliance on what you do, to
   recommend you to God as less deserving of his displeasure, or more
   worthy of pardon of your sins, and of salvation; feeling that if God
   should be strict to mark your iniquity against you, you cannot answer
   or stand before him, and must justly perish forever? Under this view
   and conviction do you constantly fly to Christ, and trust in his
   atonement, which he has made by his blood, and in his righteousness,
   for pardon and acceptance with God; feeling yourselves to be infinitely
   guilty and ill-deserving; that were it not for Christ and his
   worthiness, and your union to him and interest in his righteousness,
   you must sink into hell; and that nothing in you, or that you have done
   or can do, can be acceptable to God, unless you are accepted in the
   infinitely beloved and worthy Saviour? and in this way, and under this
   sensible conviction, whatsoever you do, do you do all in the name of
   Christ, asking all you petition for in his name, and hoping for
   acceptance and mercy for his sake alone? It has been shewn that this is
   essential to the character of those who walk humbly with God, and work
   out their own salvation with fear and trembling. He who attempts to
   work out his own salvation in any other way, is really working out his
   own destruction.

   8. On the whole, let all professing Christians seriously and with great
   care examine themselves, and inquire? whether they be really walking in
   the narrow way to heaven, described in the text; whether they have
   skill to discern and distinguish it from all others which have been
   devised by men, or that can be imagined; whether they know there are
   the strongest motives and greatest encouragements to work out their own
   salvation, while they are certain that they are wholly dependent on God
   for this, and shall do nothing unless he work in them to will and to
   do; and that by all they do they do not deserve the least favour, but
   remain as ill-deserving as ever; and find themselves as zealous and as
   much engaged to do. while they know they can do nothing of themselves,
   as if they were self-sufficient, and independent on God to work in them
   to will and do, and could merit their own salvation by what they do;
   whether their depravity of heart, and indisposition to do any good
   thing unless God work in them to will and do, be matter of shame and
   self-condemnation to them, having no excuse to offer for it, but take
   the whole blame to themselves, being disposed to justify God, should he
   leave them to perish in their sin, and always ready with pleasure to
   give him all the glory of their salvation, if he of his sovereign grace
   shall begin and carry on this work to perfection; whether they are
   willing to be in his hand, to dispose of them as he in his infinite
   wisdom and goodness shall see best, and rejoice that all men and all
   things shall be governed and disposed of so as to answer the wisest and
   best ends, thus always rejoicing in the Lord, that he reigns without
   any possible controul forever.

   He who understands our text, and sees the truths expressed and implied
   in it to be perfectly confident and harmonious, and heartily acquiesces
   in them, and in the view of these truths, and on this plan, is
   constantly working out his own salvation with fear and trembling, is
   doubtless taught of God, and made wise unto salvation, which he will
   finally obtain, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   But he who sits still or loiters with respect to this great work, from
   whatever motive, or is labouring to go to heaven in his own strength,
   independent of God, so as to be at heart opposed to his salvation being
   determined by God, and on this ground is in his heart an enemy to the
   doctrines of the decrees of God, of election, and the certain
   perseverance of all true Christians; is in darkness until now, and
   knows not the only way of salvation. The scripture warrants us in this
   conclusion, however uncharitable and censorious many may think it to
   be. We appeal to the Bible, and to the day of judgment.

   IV. This subject will be improved by urging the exhortation in the
   text. Let all who hope to be saved, make it their only business to work
   out their own salvation with fear and trembling. There is no other way
   to heaven but this; and this is a work of life, which cannot be
   finished till death takes us out of the world. This is the sight of
   faith, by perseverance in which the Christian will lay hold of eternal
   life.

   The lead deviation from this narrow way, or neglect or loitering in
   this work, is unreasonable, and an abuse of the gospel, and tends to
   evil. In order to go in this way, the flesh with the affections and
   lusts must be crucified; selfishness and pride, with all the evil
   propensity which springs from them, must be watched against and
   crossed; for all these will lead the Christian aside from the right
   way, so far as they are regarded and gratified. A strong disposition to
   self-dependence, and dependence on some creature, in opposition to
   constant dependence on God alone, is implied in these lusts. And so
   much of this is in the Christian, that he is constantly exposed to fall
   by it, and often does so, in a degree. When the Christian is in a pious
   frame, and his religious affections are strong and vigorous, he is
   exposed to trust in his present disposition and feelings for what he
   hopes to will and to do in future; and when he trusts in this as a
   stock and sufficiency of his own for some future work, he always finds
   himself disappointed, and fails of willing and doing as he expected,
   because, in proportion to his thus trusting to himself, his heart
   departed from the Lord, and in a degree forgot that he depended every
   moment on God, to work in him to will and to do. Would the Christian
   work out his own salvation, he must watch and pray against
   self-dependence, in this way, or in any other. If he trusts in any
   degree to ministers, books, the Bible, or any means, or special
   religious advantages, that these will help him in any measure,
   independent of the divine, immediate operation, working in him every
   right motion of heart, he gets so far out of the way, and cannot come
   right till he repent of his folly. Peter trusted to his own present
   feelings, and was self-confident, when he said to Christ, "Though all
   men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended:
   Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee: I will lay
   down my life for thy sake:" [Matth. xxvi. 33, 35. John xiii. 37.]
   Trusting to himself, he fell from his own stedfastness, and could not
   be recovered without deep and bitter repentance. Let all be hence
   warned not to be high-minded, but fear; and let him who thinketh he
   standeth, take heed lest he fall. When the Christian is weak, fears and
   trembles in a sense of his own insufficiency, and feels his dependence
   on God constantly to work in him to will and do, then is he strong to
   run the race which is set before him, and work out his own salvation.

   To what has been said, the following particulars may be added as
   motives to engage in and pursue this work.

   I. Consider how great this work is. There is none equal to it, or to be
   compared with it. It is to overcome self, sin and Satan, even all the
   powers of darkness; principalities and powers, rulers of the darkness
   of this world, spiritual wickedness in high places. Nothing short of
   Omnipotence can strengthen you to perform it, even the mighty power of
   God, which he wrought in Christ when he railed him from the dead, and
   set him at his own right-hand, far above all principality, and power,
   and might, and dominion. At the same time that the consideration of the
   greatness of this work leads to fear and tremble, to feel our own
   insufficiency, and to trust in God alone for a will and strength to do
   it, it serves as a mighty motive to desire to engage in it and go
   through, by the power and grace of Christ. The motive is great and
   strong in proportion to the magnitude of the work before us.

   2. Consider the consequence of neglecting this work, or performing it.
   The consequence of the former is, to perish forever; for none can be
   saved but those who in this way overcome. The consequence of the latter
   is, to sit down with Christ on his throne, and reign with him forever.

   3. Consider the abundant encouragement, and innumerable great and
   precious promises, which Christians have to strengthen and animate them
   in this work, and to trust in Christ to carry them through. They who
   trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be moved; they
   shall renew their strength; shall mount up with wings as eagles; they
   shall run and not be weary, and. they shall walk and not faint.

   4. Consider the pleasure and happiness there is in working out your own
   salvation with fear and trembling. It is not a slavish, servile work.
   There is pleasure in this fear and trembling, which is nothing more
   than true humility and trust in God. No man knows what true happiness
   is, who is not cordially engaged in this work. And he who is thus
   working out his own salvation has true pleasure and happiness in his
   work. He has joy and peace in believing, and is going on to complete,
   everlasting rest and joy in the kingdom of Christ.

   This subject will be concluded with an address to sinners who neglect
   the great salvation.

   The words of the text are not directly and immediately addressed to
   you; yet they contain matter of instruction, conviction, admonition and
   exhortation to you; to which it is of the greatest importance that you
   should attend.

   You are here taught your sinful, depraved, undone state; that you are
   so under the dominion of evil propensities, that you will not be
   persuaded and disposed to exercise one right volition or thought,
   unless God work it in you by his good Spirit; to do which he is under
   no obligation, and you are constantly provoking him not to do it, but
   to give you up to eternal destruction. Here you have set before you
   your guilt, misery and danger in a most clear and affecting light. At
   the same time you are taught that your neglect of salvation, and all
   that moral depravity, in the exercise of which you are sinning against
   Christ, and running into ruin, is your own inexcusable, aggravated
   wickedness, of which you are continually guilty, and is enough to sink
   you down to the deepest hell; and will certainly do it, unless God
   shall exercise sovereign mercy to you, and you repent and turn, and are
   willing to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

   And as your opposition of heart to this, and even the neglect of this
   salvation, is altogether your own fault, for which you have no excuse,
   consisting in your own inclination and choice, heaven and all the
   blessings of it are opened and freely offered to your acceptance, and
   you are invited, exhorted and commanded to work out your own salvation
   with fear and trembling, having a promise that in this way you shall
   certainly be saved.

   All this is set before you and urged upon you in the discourses on this
   subject which you have heard. Your attention to these truths is
   therefore demanded by all the authority of heaven. And you are required
   heartily to receive and comply with them, and thus to lay hold on
   eternal life, which is now set before you and offered to you as really
   as to any one else. Therefore if you perish, it will be by your own
   inexcusable and greatly aggravated fault. These truths are infinitely
   important and interesting to you; for you will be forever happy or
   miserable, accordingly as you cordially embrace or reject them.

   Say not, "I am not elected, and therefore cannot be saved, let me do
   what I will, as the decrees of God are against me." This is horrid
   presumption, for you to meddle with and pretend to determine that which
   is secret, and aft upon it. Besides, it is revealed and certain that if
   you perish you will perish as really and as much by your own
   inexcusable fault, as if there were no decree of God concerning you.
   This plea and excuse will appear to be vain and unreasonable, when the
   truth comes to light; and that it proceeded from a heart full of enmity
   against God; and being silenced it will serve to aggravate the
   destruction of those who make it. Oh! of what infinite importance then
   is it to you, that you should wholly lay it aside before it is too
   late!

   Do not entertain the thought that you cannot embrace the gospel and
   work out your own salvation, and imagine that this is a good excuse for
   your not doing it. For this is taking upon you the character of the
   slothful servant, who thought to excuse himself for neglecting the
   right improvement of the talent .which was committed to him, by saying,
   "Lord, I knew thee, that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast
   not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed." If there ever was
   or can be a person of the character which Jesus here describes, thou
   art the man, and your excuse will be turned against you, and you will
   meet with the doom pronounced on such a servant; "Cast ye the
   unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and
   gnashing of teeth."

   It is true that you are under an inability to do any thing by which you
   shall be saved, which has been explained as consisting in the sinful
   inclinations of your own heart; and you depend entirely on God for a
   new heart, and he will give such an heart, or not, according to his
   good pleasure; and will determine whether you shall be saved or not.
   But it has been fully shewn that this kind of inability is so far from
   being an excuse for not doing, that it is the very thing wherein the
   sinner's criminality and blame consist; and to make this an excuse for
   not doing implies a great degree of stupidity and perverseness, and is
   replying against God, in the same manner that the slothful servant is
   represented to do.

   Do not give yourselves up to sloth and indifference in religion, and
   indulge your evil inclinations, in neglect of all concern about the
   salvation of your soul, because you think this is already determined by
   God, and you cannot alter the case, therefore you will not trouble
   yourself about it. This is the certain way to determine that you never
   shall be saved, and are going in the way to destruction; for this is
   the certain way to perish forever, if you persist in it, as none can go
   to heaven in this careless way.

   Besides, such a conclusion and practice is most unreasonable, and mud
   proceed from amazing blindness and stupidity. It is a disposition of
   mind which is condemned as an evidence of the greatest stupidity and
   sottishness by all who exercise any reason and common sense, in
   temporal concerns. If a man be accused of a capital crime, and is to be
   tried in a day or two, when it will be determined whether he shall be
   put to death or not, and such a man should appear to be perfectly
   unconcerned about himself and the issue of the case with respect to
   him, who could be found to justify him in this? Would not all join to
   condemn him as an unreasonable stupid man? Or should a person be
   condemned to death, for some crime, and the day of his execution be
   fixed; could he be perfectly unconcerned and easy about his case and
   fate even till the moment of execution came? If this were possible, and
   such an instance should be known, all would cry out on him, as sunk
   below the reason, sensibility and feelings of a man, being as
   thoughtless and stupid as a beast. How much more unreasonable,
   insensible and stupid must he be, who is upon the verge of eternity,
   and it must soon be determined whether he shall be unspeakably happy,
   or beyond all conception miserable forever, and yet has no concern
   about the matter, but is trifling away his time in carelessness about
   his eternal interest, and vain amusements! This is an instance of
   stupidity, sottishness, phrenzy or madness, which cannot be described!

   Do not therefore give way to such unreasonableness, stupidity and
   infatuation, as to spend your time and strength in care and exertions
   about temporal things, while you neglect the utmost, constant attention
   to, and highest concern about, those infinitely important and weighty
   matters, which hang upon every moment of your lives.

   Do not entertain so good an opinion of yourselves as to think you are
   willing to be Christians, and that the reason why you are not, is not
   the want of a willingness to embrace the gospel, and because you will
   not come to Christ for salvation; but from some other cause, for which
   you are not blameable.

   Many who are under some concern about the salvation of their souls,
   fall into this delusion, and think they are willing to come to Christ
   and be Christians if Christ were willing to receive them. Such are
   ignorant of their own hearts, and have no true idea of that which is
   implied in being a Christian; and really charge Jesus Christ and the
   gospel with falsehood; for in that he declares that whosoever will may
   come and be saved. In this way they overlook the true reason why they
   are not Christians, and shut their eyes to their own true character,
   guilt and odiousness. It is of the greatest importance that this
   delusion should be removed.

   Do not attempt to evade all conviction of the truth, and concern about
   your salvation, by flattering yourselves that you are in no present
   danger of destruction, and you shall have time enough hereafter to
   obtain salvation, though you neglect it now. Remember that you have no
   security from falling into hell one moment; and the voice of God and of
   reason to you is, "Make haste! Escape for thy life, lest thou be
   destroyed!"

   And do not indulge a thought of your own sufficiency and moral strength
   to work out your own salvation, unless God work in you to will and do.
   Many are so ignorant of themselves, and of the work of a Christian, as
   to imagine they are sufficient to begin and go through the work,
   without feeling their dependence on God. And they think they are truly
   religious, and working out their own salvation, while they are only
   gratifying their own selfishness and pride, and are in the sight of God
   abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

   There are others who are so confident of their own independent
   sufficiency to help and save themselves, when they shall set about it
   in earnest, that by this confidence in themselves they are led to
   indulge in neglect of religion, and carnal security, for the present;
   and by this delusion many are fastened down in sloth and neglect of
   their souls till it is eternally too late. Could they be persuaded to
   try their supposed strength in earnest, there would be hope that they
   would be convinced of their delusion; as many have been in this way
   thoroughly convinced and humbled. But so long as they cannot be
   awakened and roused to try their boasted strength, they are like to
   remain in the fatal delusion.

   It is of infinite importance to you that you do not, on the one hand,
   presume upon our own strength and sufficiency to work out your own
   salvation, and, trusting in yourselves that you are righteous, depend
   upon obtaining salvation by your own righteousness, or, on this
   presumption of your own sufficiency, live in ease and security, at
   present, in the indulgence of your own corrupt inclinations, depending
   on yourselves for strength and help when it shall be necessary for you
   to be religious to escape destruction; or that you do not, on the other
   hand, live in ease and the neglect of salvation, from the consideration
   of your depravity and inability to save yourselves, and your dependence
   on God for this, imagining that this takes away all obligation and
   encouragement to embrace the gospel and work out your own salvation.
   Both of these delusions equally lead to destruction.

   May you realize the infinitely evil and dangerous state in which you
   are, and be excited to fly from the wrath to come, by laying hold of
   the hope set before you, knowing that salvation is freely offered to
   you, and heaven stands open for you, and you are invited to run for
   this prize, having at the same time the offer and promise of the Holy
   Spirit, and of all the assistance you want, if you will so far trust in
   God as to ask him for all this. O sinners, why will ye die!

SERMON XV.

    WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1800.

   Romans iii. 27. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of
   works? Nay; but by the law of faith.

   THE Apostle Paul does in this epistle particularly state and explain
   the way in which sinners may obtain the favour of God, and eternal
   salvation, which is opened by the gospel. There are but two possible
   ways of obtaining the favour of God and eternal life, which he
   mentions, viz. by the works of the law, or obedience to the law of God,
   and by faith in Jesus Christ. The former way he says is impossible to
   sinners, and if it were possible, it would be highly improper, and
   attended with evil consequences. Having proved that all men are sinners
   and guilty before God, he says, "Therefore by the deeds of the law
   there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the
   knowledge of sin. Because the law worketh wrath; and the salvation of
   sinners is not of works, lest any man should boast." The latter
   therefore he establishes as the only proper, wise and possible way in
   which sinners may be justified and saved, and says, "Therefore we
   conclude that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the
   law: and it is of faith, that it might be by grace, by which boasting
   is wholly excluded."

   In attending to these words of the text, it will be attempted to
   explain them by showing what is meant by the law of works, and what by
   the law of faith, and why boasting is excluded, not by the former, but
   by the latter; and then improve the subject in some useful remarks and
   inferences from it.

   By the law of works is meant the original law or constitution, which
   requires perfect, persevering obedience, in order to have and continue
   to enjoy the favour and blessing of God, and which pronounces him
   accursed who is guilty of disobedience in one and the least possible
   instance. This law every rational creature is under obligation to obey.
   The holy angels were made under this law, and, by a sinless, perfect
   obedience to it, during the whole time of their probation, they have
   obtained and enjoy the divine approbation, and the reward of eternal
   life. This is the constitution under which Adam and all his posterity
   were made; this is the law of works. Had the father of the human race
   continued perfectly to obey this law to the end of his time of trial,
   he would by these his works have obtained eternal life for himself and
   his children too; but, by transgressing this law of works, he fell
   under the curse of it, and laid the foundation of the ruin of all his
   children, by their falling into the same state, as their sinning was,
   by divine constitution, connected with his transgression.

   And many of the sinful children of Adam have and do, through their
   pride and ignorance of themselves, and of the nature, extent and design
   of the divine law, seek and attempt to become righteous, and obtain
   pardon and salvation by the works of the law-- their own obedience.
   Most of the Jews did so in the days of the Apostles. They. sought
   righteousness as it were by the works of the law, and went about to
   establish their own righteousness; and in this way they failed of
   obtaining righteousness, and remained as much under the curse of this
   law of works as if they had attempted no obedience to it: for all who
   in this way are of the works of the law, are under the curse of it; for
   it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all the things
   which are written in the book of the law to do them. This way to life
   is forever shut against all the sons of Adam; for they have all
   transgressed it, and by this have rendered it forever impossible to
   obtain the righteousness of it by their own works and obedience. It is
   natural, however, for fallen man. Gentiles as well as Jews, to seek a
   righteousness by their obedience to this law, and to gratify their
   pride and disposition to trust and boast in themselves and their own
   righteousness; and numbers beyond our calculation in the Christian
   world have taken and are still taking this sure road to destruction,
   rather than to give up and renounce that boasting, which must be
   effectually destroyed in order to embrace the gospel.

   By the law of faith, is meant the gospel institution and dispensation,
   in which provision is made for the pardon, justification and salvation
   of sinners who are under the condemnation and curse of the law; not by
   any works of righteousness which they have done or can do, to take off
   the curse of the law, or to recommend themselves to this favour and
   blessing, but purely on the account of the atonement, righteousness and
   worthiness of Christ, in which they become interested so as to avail,
   on their behalf, to deliver from all the evil they deserve, and procure
   all the good they want, by faith in him, or believing on his name.

   It being of great importance that all should have right and clear
   conceptions of this subject, it is proper and useful to give a more
   particular description of these two laws, the law of works and the law
   of faith. This may be done to the best advantage, perhaps, by
   considering wherein they agree with each other, and in what respects
   there is a difference and opposition of one to the other; and how not
   the former, but the latter, excludes boasting.

   First. It is to be considered and shewn wherein there is an agreement
   between these two laws, and what is as true of one as of the other, and
   is common to them both.

   I. Holiness or obedience is necessarily implied and exercised in
   compliance with each and either of these laws, and in order to be
   interested in the promises and blessings which they contain.

   The law of works requires perfect and persevering holiness and
   obedience, in order to enjoy the blessings of it. The least sin cuts a
   person off from all the promised good of this law, and subjects him to
   the curse of it, without any possible remedy by that law, as has been
   before observed.

   And a compliance with the law of faith, or the covenant of grace, which
   is the same, implies holy exercise or true obedience; and this is
   absolutely necessary in order to be interested in the promises and
   blessings of this law and covenant.

   That faith from which this law or covenant has its denomination, and in
   the exercise of which this law is complied with and fulfilled, and to
   which all the promises it contains are made, implies holiness of heart,
   and is itself a holy exercise. This being an important point, and
   denied by many, so much evidence of it from scripture and reason will
   here be produced, as it is hoped will be sufficient to establish the
   truth of it to the conviction of every unprejudiced mind.

   That faith which discerns and believes the truth of the gospel from a
   view of the moral excellence and wisdom of it, and sees the character
   of Christ to be divinely excellent and beautiful, is not a mere
   speculative faith, confined to the understanding, exclusive of taste
   and exercise of heart, and cordial approbation. Moral excellence and
   beauty is not, and cannot be, the object of mere intellect, as
   distinguished from taste and discerning of heart; therefore a real
   sight of moral excellence and beauty, or loveliness, necessarily
   implies love of that excellence and beauty, and these cannot be
   distinguished or separated one from the other; for they are really one.
   and the same thing. Hence it is demonstrably certain, that the faith
   which discerns the gospel to be true and excellent, or that internal
   evidence which renders it most worthy of belief, implies a discerning,
   taste and relish of divine excellence and beauty, which is a virtuous
   disposition and exercise of heart; and is real holiness of heart, if
   there be in nature any such thing.

   But that saving faith implies and essentially consists in a holy
   exercise of heart, in embracing the gospel as excellent and holy, and
   worthy of all acceptation, a cordial approbation of Christ and his
   character, and trusting in him, is abundantly evident from the
   scripture, as well as from the reason and nature of the case.

   The following passages, among many others which might be mentioned,
   afford an undeniable proof of this.

   Believing on Christ and receiving him is mentioned as one and the same.
   "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons
   of God, even to them that believe on his name." Coming to Christ and
   believing on him is mentioned as the same things "Jesus stood and
   cried, saying. If any man thirst, let him come unto, me and drink. He
   that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly
   shall flow living waters." Receiving Christ and coming to him are holy
   exercises of heart; for the character of Christ is so perfectly holy,
   that it is impossible that an unholy heart should be pleased with it;
   and none can cordially come to him and receive him but in the exercise
   of holy love to him. Christ said to the Jews, "This is the work of God,
   that ye believe on him whom he hath sent;" and proceeds to speak of
   coming to him, and eating his flesh and drinking his blood, as being
   the same with believing on him: [John vi. 29-58.] He said to the Jews,
   "I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you;" and then
   proceeds to tell them that this was the only reason why they believed
   not on him, and did not receive him: "How can ye believe who receive
   honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God
   only?" In these words it is asserted that none can believe on him
   unless his heart be friendly to God and to him; and that it is
   impossible that any one should believe on Christ who is an impenitent
   enemy of God; which could not be true, if faith did not imply holy
   exercises of heart: [John v. 40, 44.] That faith in, Christ implies
   holiness of heart, and is a holy exercise, is asserted by Christ in his
   discourse with Nicodemus; [John iii. 18-21:] "He that believeth on the
   Son is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned already.
   And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
   men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
   evil; for every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to
   the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doth truth
   cometh to the light." If every one that doth evil, hateth the light,
   and will not come to it, and loves darkness rather than light, is
   condemned, and he that believeth on Christ is not condemned; then
   believing is coming to the light, and loving it, or receiving the truth
   in the love of it, and doing the truth, or conforming to and practising
   it, in which holiness consists. Surely nothing can be plainer and more
   strongly asserted than this is in these words.

   Believing on Christ is commanded as a duty, and therefore must be an
   exercise of the heart, and an holy exercise; for nothing can be the
   subject of command but the heart or will, and nothing was ever
   commanded by God but holiness, and nothing else can be duty. Christ
   preached, saying, "Repent and believe the gospel." He said to his
   disciples, "Ye believe in God, believe also in me." He said to the
   Jews, "This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath
   sent. The apostle John says, "This is his commandment, that we should
   believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ." Therefore believing on
   Christ is called "the obedience of faith," and obeying Christ is the
   same with believing on him. "And being made perfect he became the
   author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him." The apostle
   Paul observes, that the just lives by his faith; and says, "I live by
   the faith of the Son of God." If faith was that by which he lived, it
   was his spiritual, Christian life, which certainly is Christian
   holiness. He therefore says, "Faith worketh by love." Love is the sum
   of true holiness, but this is the efficacious, operative nature and
   life of faith, so that the faith is wholly dead and inactive, the life
   and active nature of which is not love.

   The apostle Paul says, "Abraham was strong in faith, giving glory to
   God." If faith be not friendly to God, to the divine character, it does
   not, it cannot, give any glory to God, however strong it may be; but
   friendship to God is true love to God, and is a holy exercise of heart.
   Accordingly the apostle James, speaking of Abraham believing God, says,
   "By this he obtained the character of the friend of God." If there were
   no love or holiness in saving faith, then an impenitent enemy of God
   might have as much of it, and be as strong in faith, as Abraham or any
   other man, and that too without any true discerning or sight of the
   true character of Christ, and spiritual things. "For every one that
   doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light;" which is true
   of every impenitent, unregenerate person. "The natural man receiveth
   not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him,
   neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
   Therefore, whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, or has saving
   faith, is born of God; has a new and holy heart given him of God; for
   with such a heart the spiritual man discerneth spiritual things, and
   believeth unto righteousness.

   Much more evidence might be produced from scripture to prove that
   saving faith is real gospel holiness; but as what has already been said
   on this point does make it sufficiently clear, it is needless to add
   any more proof that, according to the law of faith, holiness is as
   necessary in order to an interest in the promises and blessings of it,
   as it is according to the law of works; which is the proportion
   proposed to be proved.

   2. The holiness which is necessary in a compliance with the law of
   works and the law of faith, consists in conformity to the same law or
   rule of duty. It is therefore the same kind of holiness, as there is
   but one law and rule of holiness. All holiness consists in love to God
   and our neighbours, which, though expressed in different words, and
   exercised in a different manner and circumstances, and to answer
   different purposes, yet it is essentially one and the same thing, and
   is conformity and obedience to the same law.

   Secondly. It is to be considered wherein these two laws differ, and are
   opposed to each other.

   This may be stated and explained in the following particulars.

   1. According to the law of works, the perfectly holy and obedient offer
   to God their holiness and works of obedience as the price of the favour
   and acceptance of God, and the reason of their having his approbation
   and rewards, and God accepts and rewards them out of respect to their
   obedience and good works, as a testimony of his love of holiness, and
   pleasure in their obedience to him. Thus the holy angels were justified
   by their works. Their perfect holiness and obedience was the price of
   the favour they obtained of God. They trusted in their own
   righteousness to recommend them to God's acceptance, and the benefits
   of justification and eternal life; and, in bestowing these upon them,
   God testified his approbation of their character and works.

   The law of faith is directly the reverse of this. It opens a way for
   the pardon, justification and eternal life of sinners, who have fallen
   under the curse of the law, and are forever cut off from a possibility
   of being justified by the law of works. According to the law of faith,
   sinners are pardoned and justified by the atonement, righteousness and
   merit of Jesus Christ, and the holiness which they exercise is so far
   from recommending them to the least favour On account of their moral
   worth and excellence, that it wholly consists in what is implied in
   receiving these blessings and all they want as free gift to the
   infinitely guilty and ill-deserving, without money or price, from the
   hands of an infinitely gracious and bountiful benefactor.

   By faith the sinner comes to Christ for all he wants, sensible that by
   sin he has undone himself, and may justly be cast off by God into
   eternal destruction; he confesses his sins and ill desert, and heartily
   approves of the law of God, which condemns and curses him, as just,
   good and excellent, worthy to be maintained and honoured. He highly
   approves of the character of Christ, in seeking and promoting the
   honour of God, by vindicating and honouring the law which sinners had
   transgressed and trampled under foot, by suffering the curse of it
   himself, in dying on the cross, and obeying it perfectly. He is pleased
   with the way of salvation by Christ, in which the sinner is humbled and
   saved by free grace, and not by works of righteousness which he has
   done or can do; and he is greatly pleased with the deliverance from all
   sin, and that perfect holiness which Christ will bestow on all who
   believe in him; and he is satisfied with that heaven and happiness,
   that glorious immortality, which Christ has brought to light, and will
   cause all believers fully and eternally to possess, as his purchase and
   free gift to them, though in themselves infinitely unworthy and
   ill-deserving. Thus the believer comes to Christ as the apostle Paul
   did, desiring not to be found in his own righteousness, which is of the
   law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
   which is of God by faith.

   This is the great, capital and most striking difference and opposition
   between the law of works and the law of faith, which, it is presumed,
   will be clearly understood by every judicious, attentive person, and
   appear to be of great importance to be made and always kept in mind.

   It may be useful, however, to some, farther to explain and illustrate
   this interesting and important point by the parable of the elder son
   and the prodigal. The latter having rendered himself guilty, odious and
   wretched, by leaving his father's house, and foolish conduct, when his
   eyes were opened, and he saw how guilty, wretched and undone he was,
   and that all he wanted for his relief was to be had in his father's
   house, he determined to go and cast himself upon the goodness and mercy
   of his father, confessing his folly and sin in abusing his father and
   leaving his house, and his utter unworthiness of the least favour. In
   this, and in receiving all he wanted from the free, undeserved kindness
   of his parent, was exercised and expressed as real love to him and his
   family, as his elder brother had done, if he were as good and obedient
   as he represented himself to be. The latter recommended himself to his
   father's approbation and favour by his constant obedience and good
   deeds: the prodigal was covered with shameful guilt, unworthiness and
   ill desert, and humbly and gladly receives all that is bestowed upon
   him as a free gift to an unworthy creature, who might justly have been
   left to perish without the least relief, having nothing to recommend
   him to favour, but every thing to the contrary. The one brings and
   offers his works of obedience as the reason why he should be favoured
   and rewarded, or as the price by which he had purchased the blessings
   he desired and expected; the other has nothing but shame, guilt and
   wretchedness, and seeks and accepts of his father's kindness in
   receiving him to his favour, and all the privileges, enjoyments and
   honours of his family, as a free gift to a most ill-deserving son, who
   could make no compensation for the injury he had done. But in his
   friendly thought he had of his father, in his returning hence to him,
   confessing his sin and unworthiness of any favour, and cordial
   acceptance of offered mercy, and gladly coming into his father's house
   and family, he exercised as real love and friendship to his parent and
   his family, and to the laws, business and enjoyments of his house, as
   did the elder son: and yet their love and friendship was exercised and
   expressed in very different and opposite ways, according to their
   different and opposite state and circumstances.

   But the difference and opposition between these two laws of works and
   faith in other respects, which are implied in or do arise from that
   already mentioned, though not so great and important, yet must be
   noticed, as necessary in order fully to understand the subject to which
   we are attending.

   2. None can be justified and obtain eternal life by the law of works,
   unless he is perfectly obedient and holy, without the least sin or
   defect.

   But by the law of faith the least degree of holiness exercised by a
   sinner, in believing in Christ, and coming to him, and trusting in him
   for pardon and salvation, obtains justification and the promise of
   eternal life, while he is yet attended with a great degree of
   unholiness and sin. The reason of this difference is, because by the
   law of works a creature is justified by his own works or holiness,
   which therefore must be perfect; for by the least sin he falls under
   the curse of the law, and can never after obtain any blessing by it:
   "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it
   is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all the things
   which are written in the book of the law to do them." But by the law of
   faith the sinner is not justified by his own works or holiness, but
   wholly by the merit and righteousness of Christ. The least exercise of
   holiness by which a sinner accepts of Christ offering himself to him,
   and comes to him for pardon, righteousness and complete redemption,
   interests him in all the blessings Christ has obtained for sinners, and
   in all the promises of the covenant of grace. "He that believeth on the
   Son hath everlasting life. Verily, verily I say unto you, he that
   heareth my word, and believeth on him who sent me, hath everlasting
   life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death to
   life."

   This leads to observe another difference between these two laws.

   3. By the law of works a creature cannot be justified until he has
   persevered in perfect obedience to the end of the time of his
   probation: but by the law of faith the sinner is justified, and
   interested in all the promises of the gospel, and made an heir of
   eternal life, upon the first act of faith in Christ. "He that believeth
   on the Son hath everlasting life; he shall not come into condemnation,
   but is passed from death to life." Saving faith is indeed a persevering
   faith, so that he who once believes will continue to believe to the end
   of life. His faith shall never fail; not because it is in its own
   nature a. persevering faith, or from the power and sufficiency of the
   believer, but because God has promised, in the covenant of grace, that
   he who once believes, to whom lie has given faith to lay hold of and
   embrace this covenant by believing on Christ, shall be kept by the
   power of God through faith unto salvation. The first act of faith being
   in this sense and manner a persevering faith, the promise is made to
   believing, even the very first act of it, and it is proper that this
   should bring into a state of justification, and give a title to eternal
   life, as the first act: of faith is the beginning of an everlasting
   union to Christ, in whom the believer has everlasting righteousness and
   strength.

   4. Though the holiness of the law of works and the law of faith be the
   same in nature and kind, consisting in obedience to the same, and
   conformable to the revealed will of God; yet, owing to the state and
   circumstances of the sinner, and the different way and manner of
   obtaining justification by the exercise of holiness, which has been
   described, there is a real and great, though circumstantial, difference
   in the exercise of the same holiness. The sinner, infinitely guilty,
   ill-deserving and wretched, exercises his love to God and his law, and
   to Christ the mediator, in coming to and trusting in Christ, and
   receiving from him deliverance from the infinite evil he deserves, and
   from all sin, and accepting of all the good he wants and is capable of
   enjoying to all eternity, as a free, undeserved gift. He has a greater
   sense of the infinite goodness and free grace of God, and feels more
   dependent on this, and more indebted to God, and under greater
   obligations to him, than the holy angels who have never sinned can; and
   consequently the redeemed exercise a greater degree of humility, and a
   more ardent and sweet love of gratitude, and render a higher tribute of
   praise to God, their Redeemer and Saviour, than they are capable of who
   have never sinned. Therefore the redeemed from among men are
   represented as singing a new song before the throne of God, which none
   but they could learn.

   Thirdly. It is to be considered how and why all boasting is excluded by
   the law of faith, as it has been explained.

   It is not implied in this, that the law of works, when rightly
   understood and perfectly obeyed, affords any ground of boasting in a
   bad sense, or of sinful boasting, which is meant here. The holy angels,
   who are justified, and have obtained the reward of eternal life by the
   law of works, have no ground for boasting. They have no pride, and do
   not glory in themselves, in their own obedience and works, but in the
   Lord, in his munificence and glorious character. But this law of works
   is not suited to the sinner, to obtain justification and life by it;
   for he has fallen under the curse of it, and is forever excluded from
   the righteousness of it in his own person; and to suppose a sinner can
   be justified by any obedience or works he can perform, is to let him
   infinitely higher than the place and state he is in, and to dishonour
   and degrade the law; and for a sinner to attempt this, is a most daring
   instance of pride and self-confident boasting. And were it possible
   that a sinner could obtain the favour of God, and justification, by any
   obedience or holiness of his own, and out of respect: to the worth and
   amiableness of that, this would please and flatter his pride, and
   nothing could prevent his haughty boasting of himself and his own good
   works. And this suits the heart of proud man; he naturally seeks to be
   justified by his own works, if he seeks it at all, that he may have
   something to boast of, by recommending himself to the favour of God by
   his own good deeds, being ignorant of himself, of his own character,
   and of God and his law.

   Thus the Jews rejected the law of faith, and followed after
   righteousness, and obtained it not, because they fought it not by
   faith, but as it were by the works of the law. They, being ignorant of
   God's righteousness, went about, or attempted, to establish their own
   righteousness. And many thousands and millions of Gentiles in the
   Christian world have stumbled at that Humbling Hone, the law of faith,
   which excludes boasting, and have fought and are now seeking to be
   saved by the law of works; how many millions none can tell! And perhaps
   there is not, nor ever has been, one of the sons or daughters of Adam
   who has enjoyed the light of divine revelation, and has in any measure
   or way sought to be saved, who has not in a greater or less degree made
   this wicked and dangerous attempt. Happy are they who have been cured
   of boasting by embracing the law of faith.

   What has been said in describing the law of faith is sufficient to show
   that it excludes all boasting. The sinner in this way is received to
   favour, is justified and saved, not on account of any works he has
   done, or ever will do, and is not recommended to favour by any
   worthiness or holiness he has, but is considered as in himself, as poor
   and naked, wretched and miserable, infinitely guilty, and deserving to
   be cast into hell forever, and all the favour he receives is a free,
   undeserved gift and bounty, yea, bounty to the most ill-deserving.
   Where is boasting then? What has he to boast of but guilt, ill-desert,
   poverty and wretchedness?

   And all this is not only true, and he is viewed in this light by God,
   agreeable to his holy law; but the sinner is made to feel and
   acknowledge this, and cannot believe on Christ and come to him by
   faith, unless he has a clear conviction of his own vile, odious
   character, and feels that he has no worthiness to recommend him to the
   least favour, but is infinitely far from it; that he is so unworthy and
   infinitely guilty and ill-deserving, that he may be justly hated by
   God, and cast into endless destruction. Thus the sinner, in complying
   with the law of faith, even in the first and every act of faith in
   Christ, humbles himself in the sight of God, while he is made in a
   sense to annihilate himself before God, yea, to feel that he is
   infinitely worse than nothing. And all his holiness, and every right
   exercise of mind, consists in a hearty acknowledgement of this, and
   thus humbling himself, and approving of the character of Christ, and
   the way of justification and salvation by him, which is the law of
   faith, and in views and exercises which are implied in this. Thus all
   pride and disposition to boast is counteracted and destroyed, the
   sinner abases himself, and rejoices to exalt free, sovereign grace,
   when and so far as he believes in Christ, and is pleased with the law
   of faith: and the more holy and obedient he is, in conforming to this
   law, the more humble he is, and farther from all disposition to boast.
   Thus all boasting is entirely and forever excluded by the law of faith.

SERMON XVI.

   Romans iii. 27. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of
   works? Nay; but by the law of faith.

IMPROVEMENT.

   I. WE learn from what has been observed on this subject, that they make
   a great mistake, and have espoused a dangerous and hurtful error, who
   believe and assert that if faith or believing in Christ, in order to
   justification, is a virtuous or holy act, or implies any real goodness,
   then the sinner has something lo recommend himself, which is of real
   worth, of which he has reason to boast, and must be acceptable to God;
   and therefore has no need of the merits of Christ and free grace in
   order to be justified. They therefore contend that to assert that a
   sinner must exercise any holiness previous to his justification, and in
   order to it, and that faith is a holy act, is entirely to subvert the
   gospel, and lays a foundation for boasting, and flatters the pride of
   man. Of these there have been, and now are, not a few in all parts of
   the protestant world.

   What has been said on this subject serves to show how unreasonable and
   contrary to the truth this notion is, and the evil tendency of it. But
   it may be useful and of importance to review some things which have
   been mentioned in the preceding discourse, by which the error and
   absurdity of this opinion will be abundantly exposed and confuted.

   I. The sinner is under the curse of the holy, righteous and good law of
   God, which pronounces him to be a hateful, accursed creature, deserving
   to lie under the divine displeasure and wrath forever. Every
   transgressor of this law is under this curse and in this state,
   whatever holy obedience he had performed, and how long soever he had
   continued perfectly holy before his sin. His transgression, even one
   instance of it, totally obliterates and annihilates his preceding
   holiness, so that it cannot have the least influence to prevent the
   curse coming upon him, or alleviate it in any degree; but he is as
   odious and guilty, and as much the object of God's displeasure for his
   transgression, as if his previous holiness never had existence, which
   cannot be reckoned in his favour in any respect or degree, without
   counteracting the law of God, and setting it aside in favour of the
   sinner, who by it is cursed. And it is the same with regard to any
   future holiness and obedience. If the sinner repent and turn to
   obedience, though ever so perfect and long continued, this would not in
   the least degree atone for the sin of which he had been guilty, or
   remove the curse which the law has fixed upon him for his sin; and
   therefore could not be more acceptable to God than if he had not
   obeyed, or than his obedience before he sinned, and cannot be the
   reason and ground of his receiving any favour from God, as after
   obedience is as much obliterated and rendered of no avail to recommend
   to any favour, by his sin, as his obedience before he sinned, it being
   equally contrary to the law, which pronounces him accursed, to regard
   and accept or show any favour for his after obedience, as for the
   former, and it cannot be done without vacating and setting it aside, as
   not worthy of regard.

   This is the plain law of God, which curses every one who continueth not
   to obey it in all things which it requires, and holds him under this
   curse, notwithstanding all the obedience he had paid to it before he
   sinned, or any obedience after that. The law affords no remedy or help,
   or grants any thing better than what is contained in the curse. This is
   the law of God. It is his voice to all his creatures who are moral
   agents. It is the language of his heart, which he will never counteract
   or contradict, in words or conduct. He views the sinner in the light in
   which his law sets him, and will treat him accordingly so long as he
   remains under the curse of it, and is not delivered from it in a way
   which is perfectly consistent with it, and in which as much regard is
   paid to it, as if the sinner remained under the curse of it forever.

   Therefore, whatever repentance and approbation of the law which curses
   him, and love to God, the sinner exercises before he is delivered from
   the curse by actually coming to Christ: and believing on him, does not
   in any degree remove his guilt, or render him less deserving of the
   curse, and cannot recommend him to the least favour; but he is in the
   sight of God as much accursed and the object: of his displeasure, and
   in this sense as truly ungodly, as he was before, and as if he had no
   such exercises of love and repentance, as they cannot be reckoned in
   his favour, so as in the least to remove the curse. And whatever
   repentance, and love to God and his law, or holiness, is necessary in
   order to come to Christ, and is exercised in coming to him and
   believing on him, this cannot, in itself considered, recommend the
   sinner to favour, or render him less unworthy or leis accursed; but as
   by this the sinner lays hold of Christ, and is united to him, he comes
   within the reach of his merit and worthiness, so as by him who has been
   made a curse he may consistent with the law be delivered from the curse
   of it, and obtain all the favour which he wants. And being thus by
   Christ delivered from the curse of the law, and pardoned and justified
   by virtue of his atonement and righteousness, his person and his holy
   exercises of faith and love become acceptable to God through Jesus
   Christ, to whom he is united, God may now be just, and maintain and
   honour his righteous law, and the justifier of him who believeth in
   Jesus, he being made accepted in his beloved Son, in whom he is well
   pleased. [5]

   The reason of all this--why the sinner's holiness before or after he
   has once sinned cannot be acceptable and reckoned in his favour, or in
   any degree remove the curse of the law, and whatever holiness he may
   exercise previous to his union to Christ, and is necessary in order to
   his coming to Christ, and actually forming this vital union to him,
   cannot render him acceptable to God, or less unworthy and accursed, and
   why he is totally unacceptable, as ungodly and cursed by God, till he
   is actually united to Christ, and can be accepted only in the
   worthiness of this beloved Son of God--the reason of this is plain and
   easy to be seen.

   The transgression of the law of God in the least single instance is
   rebellion against a Being infinitely great, powerful, wise, just and
   good, who has absolute and unlimited right and authority to command and
   give law to his creatures; they are therefore under infinite obligation
   to perfect obedience; and consequently a violation of this obligation
   can be no less than an infinite crime, or an infinite moral evil.
   Besides, he who rebels against God, has a disposition and will to
   dethrone him, and put an end to his law, authority and moral
   government, and introduce infinite confusion and misery through the
   whole universe; and his conduct tends to his, and would actually effect
   it were it possible, and were it not counteracted and prevented. Every
   sin therefore must be an infinite evil, in the nature and tendency of
   it. There is no moral truth more demonstrably clear and certain than
   this; and this is a truth on which many other moral truths depend,
   which relate to the law of God and his moral government, as we shall
   see. [6]

   Sin being thus an infinite moral evil, no temporary sufferings of the
   sinner, or of any mere creature, can make the least degree of atonement
   for it, so as in any measure to alleviate or deliver him from the curse
   of the law. And it is equally certain that no holiness of a mere
   creature can avail to recommend him who has once sinned to the least
   favour. Though the sinner had been perfectly obedient and holy a
   thousand years before he sinned, this is but a finite moral good, and
   therefore the infinite moral evil of which he has been guilty
   infinitely overbalances his finite holiness, so that it weighs nothing
   in the opposite scale, and does no more to lighten or take off the
   curse, than if it never had existence. And this is equally true of any
   obedience which the sinner should perform after he had once sinned, as
   has already been observed: it has no tendency to take off the curse,
   and cannot recommend him to any favour, or be the least ground or
   reason of his being considered and treated any better or otherwise than
   as one who is justly cursed, unworthy of any favour, and deserving all
   the evils of the curse. And therefore it would be unreasonable, and
   acting contrary to the law, to consider and treat him otherwise, or
   shew him any favour out of respect to his obedience.

   Thus it appears certain, that it is impossible that the holiness of a
   creature who has once sinned, should be accepted as a reason of his
   having any favour, and being in any respect delivered from the curse of
   the law, as the evil of his sin infinitely outweighs all the moral good
   of which he is capable, and sinks it into nothing, so as to render it
   wholly unacceptable, consistent with the divine law, were it true that
   such obedience or moral good might take off the curse of the law, and
   render the sinner acceptable, did it overbalance, or were it equal to,
   the evil of his sin. But even this is not true. The curse of the law
   denounces infinite natural evil as the punishment which sin deserves,
   and therefore cannot be taken off or removed by any thing but
   suffering. No degree of obedience or moral good, be it ever so much or
   so great, can make any atonement for one the least sin, so as to
   deliver the sinner from the curse. Therefore Christ himself was made a
   curse, that by suffering the evil of the curse, the just suffering for
   the unjust, he might deliver the sinner who believes in him from the
   curse, and open the way for him to come to God with acceptance.

   From all this it appears that the opinion under consideration, that, if
   the sinner is recovered to any degree of holiness antecedent to his
   justification by the merit and righteousness of Christ, and in order to
   it, he has whereof to glory, and has a righteousness of his own which
   is acceptable to God, so that he stands in no need of the righteousness
   of Christ in order to be justified; that this opinion is a great and
   dangerous error, most contrary to the reason and nature of things, and
   the holy law of God, and really perverts and makes void both law and
   gospel Therefore they who hold and persist in this error are in truth
   and in a high degree Antinomians, as their doctrine makes the law
   wholly void in the most important and essential branch of it. And their
   doctrine on this point is totally Antichristian. For the law is in such
   a sense the foundation of the gospel, that if the former be perverted
   and made void, the latter becomes unintelligible and useless. If
   sinners may be delivered from the curse of the law, and obtain favour
   and; unification, by becoming in any degree holy and obedient, then
   they may be saved without Christ and the gospel. "If there had been a
   law which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been
   by the law; and if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead
   in vain:" [Gal. ii. 21, iii. 21.]

   We hope that men, some of them at least, who hold and propagate these
   antinomian and antichristian doctrines in theory, have better hearts
   than heads, and love and embrace the truth in the former, while they
   believe that which is gross and dangerous error with the latter,

   2. Were the preceding observations not true, which is indeed an
   impossible supposition, and could the sinner, on becoming perfectly
   holy and obedient, be delivered from the curse of the law, and admitted
   to the acceptance and favour of God, and his past sin not be remembered
   against him, out of respect to his present holiness, consistent with
   the law of God, yet this does not touch the case of a sinner, who only
   exercises so much of a right disposition as is necessarily implied in
   approving of the character and law of God, and of Christ, and in coming
   to him for pardon, justification and life. He may exercise such a
   degree of holiness consistent with his having much more sin than
   holiness at the same time, which is undoubtedly true of every sinner
   who embraces the gospel, and of every Christian as long as he lives in
   this world. A sinner who becomes friendly to God, and embraces the
   gospel, has such low and sinfully deficient exercises of love, and so
   much of that which is contrary, and positive wickedness, that, aside
   from his guilt for former sins, his present character, considered in
   itself, has much more evil than good, and, on the whole, is worse than
   nothing, and cannot be an object of the complacency and favour of God,
   but rather of his displeasure and curse, and he stands in as much need
   of favour and justification by free grace through the righteousness of
   Christ, as if he had no holiness, and were altogether an enemy to God:
   for he has no money or price to purchase this favour, and is
   continually running more in debt. And to plead his good character as
   proper to recommend him to the least favour, would be highly
   displeasing to God, and must be so to every good man, whether done by
   the sinner himself, or any other person.

   They who make the objection under consideration, who think themselves
   Christians, and that they do exercise holiness, may be asked, whether
   they think this has railed them above the need of free grace and
   justification by the righteousness of Christ, or at least do not stand
   in so much need of it as they should if they had no degree of holiness.
   If they answer in the affirmative, they are not such Christians as was
   the apostle Paul. If they answer in the negative, and fav that they are
   as dependent on the righteousness of Christ for justification and all
   favour as if they were wholly unholy, and they expect to be saved by
   free grace as much as they could be if they could be saved in their
   sins without any holiness, that they are far from having any thing to
   boast of, and the more conformed they are to God in holiness, or the
   more they see God and love him, the more they are disposed to abase and
   humble themselves before him, and feel their need of such a Saviour as
   Jesus Christ; then by this confession they entirely give up their
   objection, and grant that whatever holiness the sinner may exercise
   previous to his justification, and in his coming to Christ for it, this
   does not make him the more deserving of favour, nor does he stand in
   less need of justification by free grace through the worthiness of
   Christ; and it will be so far from disposing him to be proud, and
   boast, that it will bring him to humble himself at the foot of
   sovereign, free grace, which humility will increase as he shall grow in
   grace, and in the knowledge of his Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

   But further to confute, if that be possible, and show how false and
   absurd the tenet is which we are opposing, it must be observed,

   3. The holiness which the sinner exercises in believing on Christ and
   coming to him for all he wants, is so far from being the ground of
   pride and boasting, or promoting and encouraging this, that it directly
   counteracts and destroys such a disposition. The sinner's heart is
   naturally full of pride, and a disposition which is gratified in self
   exaltation and boasting; and nothing can cure him of this reigning
   disposition, and in any degree destroy his pride, but a change of heart
   by the Spirit of God, by which pride receives a deadly wound, and he is
   disposed to humble himself in the sight of God. And the grace he hereby
   receives and exercises consists in discerning and confessing his
   sinful, lost state, that the law he has transgressed is just and good,
   that he is infinitely vile and ill deserving, that God may justly send
   him to endless destruction at any time, that he has nothing that can
   deserve or recommend him to the least favour, but every thing in every
   respect infinitely to the contrary: and in this view and sense of his
   own character he comes to Christ as a poor, infinitely guilty and
   wretched sinner, and begs for mercy, not for his own sake, or for any
   thing he has done or ever shall do, but for the sake of what Christ has
   suffered and done, pleased and hoping to be pardoned and received to
   favour by free, undeserved grace through Jesus Christ, desiring forever
   to be abased and humbled, and that the most undeserved, sovereign grace
   may be exalted and honoured in his salvation.

   Where is pride and boasting then? It is effectually excluded and
   destroyed, by the exercise of that grace and holiness by which the
   sinner approves of the character and law of God, condemns himself as
   justly deserving eternal misery and nothing better, and looks to Christ
   for undeserved, free pardon and favour to an infinitely guilty, odious,
   undeserving, wretched beggar. He who can believe that such exercises,
   which are according to the law of faith, are agreeable to the pride of
   man, and will lead to boasting, may with as good reason believe that
   humility is pride, and self abasement is self exaltation.

   And besides all this which has been now said to confute this error, it
   must be observed, that they who exclude all holiness from saving faith,
   by which the sinner is justified, left if it were a holy exercise he
   would have reason to boast as having something of his own to recommend
   himself, do suppose that a proud, impenitent enemy to God and his law,
   may see the truth, wisdom and goodness of the gospel, and approve of
   the character of Christ, and the way of salvation by him, which
   supposition is as unreasonable and absurd, and as contrary to the holy
   scripture, as can be made or conceived. And it is indeed most
   dishonourable to Christ and the gospel, as if his character was such
   that a wicked man, an impenitent enemy of God, might discern the truth
   and excellency of it, and heartily approve and be pleased with it! How
   contrary is this to the declaration of Christ and his Apostle! The
   former says, "He that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
   light." And the latter, "The natural man receiveth not the things of
   the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he
   know them, because they are spiritually discerned." [7]

   II. From this subject it appears, that saving faith, by which the just
   do live, is a very different thing from what many have imagined and
   taught.

   Saving faith consists in the discerning and belief of the truths of the
   gospel, and cordial approbation of them, and conformity to them, which
   is peculiar to a renewed, wise and understanding heart. It implies the
   whole of evangelical holiness, in the exercise of which men believe on
   Christ, receive him and cleave to him with purpose of heart, and walk
   in him, and by which he dwells in their hearts. It is the life of a
   Christian, and is essential to all his holiness, and cannot be
   distinguished from it; for it all consists in fighting the sight of
   faith, by which he lays hold of eternal life.

   Therefore the faith by which sinners are justified does not consist in
   mere speculation, or conviction and judgment and reason, considered as
   distinct from the heart and the exercises of that, or of the will and
   affections; which has been the opinion of many. It is presumed enough
   has been said fully to confute this notion.

   Nor does saving faith consist in the sinner's believing and persuasion
   that he is justified, that Christ died for him, is his, so that he
   shall certainly be saved. This belief an impenitent enemy to Christ may
   entertain, and yet continue as impenitent and unholy as he was before.
   Besides, there is no foundation for such a persuasion or belief,
   antecedent to the exercise of saving faith, by and in consequence of
   which a sinner is justified; but it is perfect delusion and falsehood.
   No such thing is revealed in the Bible, that a sinner is justified
   before he believes in Christ, cordially receives him, and is reconciled
   to God; but the contrary; that he is condemned, and under the wrath of
   God. Therefore a belief that his sins are pardoned, and that God loves
   him, antecedent to his having an interest in Christ by cordially
   receiving him, is a delusion, and is a persuasion grounded entirely on
   a false suggestion, either from his own heart, or the father of lies.

   It has been said, and published, in vindication of this sort of faith,
   that men must believe that they are justified, &c. that by their
   believing it may become true, according to their faith; and therefore
   they must believe without any evidence of the truth of it, either from
   scripture, sense or reason, that by their so believing it may become
   true. And indeed there is no other way to adhere to this notion of
   faith, but by embracing this mass of absurdity and nonsense.

   Volumes have been written in this century by men in high repute for
   piety, in which this notion of faith rung through the whole; and they
   have been, and still are, read by multitudes with high approbation.
   Without calling in question the piety of the authors or their admirers,
   many, if not most of whom probably do not critically attend to their
   notion of faith, but to the good things which they have written; there
   is sufficient warrant to say that this notion of faith is not only most
   contrary to the scriptures, but as unintelligible, and attended with as
   many absurdities, as any religious tenet that was ever thought of and
   propagated by Mahomet, the Man of Sin, or any one else.

   This notion of faith is not only in itself unscriptural and most
   absurd, but, considered in the tendency of it, and that with which it
   is connected, the dangerous and destructive consequence of it will
   appear. They who entertain this notion of faith, suppose that the
   impenitent enemy of God, upon believing that God loves him, that his
   sins are pardoned, &c. does begin to repent and love God, &c. because
   he is persuaded that God loves him and will save him; that by this
   belief, and under this persuasion, the sinner is converted, and becomes
   a true friend of God, and a real Christian. They say that a sinner
   cannot be brought to love God, until he first sees or believes that God
   loves him, or is in some manner and degree become propitious to him;
   that a fight and real belief of this is effectual to induce him to love
   God, and live a holy life. This makes his conversion and all his love
   and holiness to be nothing but selfishness and pride; and such a
   conversion does not imply any change of heart for the better, but for
   the worse, and all. his supposed holiness is nothing but selfishness
   and sin, which the world of men may practise, and continue real enemies
   to the true character of God. The Lord Jesus Christ has decided this in
   the most plain and express words: "If ye love them which love you, what
   thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them."

   The Christian, after he has believed and embraced the gospel, and is
   justified, may, on reflecting on his own state and exercises, have good
   evidence that he does love Christ, and is a true believer; and
   therefore that he is justified and shall be saved; this consequently he
   may believe, and in this way obtain the "assurance of hope." But this
   is not saving faith, or any part of it; for saving faith must take
   place before he is justified, and there must be ground of evidence that
   he has saving faith, before he can have any reason to believe that he
   is in a state of justification, and shall be saved. [8]

   III. From the view we have had of the law of faith we may see the
   reason why men are naturally opposed to the gospel, and refuse to
   comply with it, viz. because holiness is necessarily implied in an
   approbation of it and cordially embracing it. Therefore faith is the
   gift of God. In order to believe on Christ, a man must be born again of
   the Spirit of God, have a new heart given to him, and be made a new
   creature, friendly to true holiness. This is therefore abundantly
   asserted in the scriptures. It will be sufficient here to refer to the
   words of the apostle John: "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
   Christ, is born of God."

   If the gospel were an institution which might be approved of, believed
   and truly embraced, by an unholy heart, an unregenerate man; it would
   not be an holy institution, and therefore could not be from God. Jesus
   Christ is a holy Saviour; holiness is essential to every part of his
   character, to all his words and works. Salvation by him is a holy
   salvation, and the way of salvation is wise and holy in every view of
   it. It is therefore impossible that an unholy heart should come near to
   this Saviour with the least inclination towards him, and the way of
   salvation by him; but such an heart must hate him, and choose to keep
   at a distance from him and avoid him; and can be no more reconciled to
   him and the gospel, than to the holy law of God.

   How degrading and dishonourable to Christ and the gospel then, and how
   unreasonable and absurd, is their notion, who hold that the gospel is
   suited to please and win the heart of an unregenerate man, so that
   while he hates God's holy law, he with an unholy heart embraces the
   gospel, and in this way and by this means his heart is changed, and he
   becomes friendly to God and his holy law! When shall the professed
   friends of the gospel cease to dishonour and pervert it, in order to
   suit it to the taste and inclination of an unholy heart?

   IV. We hence learn that all the interests of true virtue and holiness
   are as much and as well secured and promoted by the law of faith, as
   they are or can be by the law of works.

   Many have thought that the doctrine of justification by faith, through
   the atonement and merit of Christ, not being in the least recommended
   to this favour by any works or holiness of our own, is a licentious
   doctrine, and tends to influence men to neglect a holy life, and give
   themselves to sloth and sin. But this has been wholly owing to their
   ignorance of the subject.

   According to the law of faith, true holiness is as necessary in order
   to justification, as if the sinner were justified by the merit of his
   works, though in a different way and for a different reason, as has
   been shewn. Faith itself, by which the sinner receives Christ, and
   renounces all dependence on his own holiness to recommend him to the
   least favour, and relies on free, undeserved grace for the
   justification of one infinitely unworthy and ill-deserving; this faith
   itself is a holy exercise, as has been proved; and men cannot live by
   faith but by living an holy life.

   As real holiness in love to the character of God and his law is
   exercised in approving of the character of Christ, and coming to him
   and trusting in him for pardon, justification and eternal life, as can
   be in obeying the law of God, as the price of the divine favour,
   according to the law of works. Holiness is as really and necessarily
   exercised in applying to God as an infinitely gracious and bountiful
   benefactor; and gratefully receiving of him infinite favour and
   blessings as a free gift to the infinitely guilty and ill-deserving, as
   is or can be exercised in obedience to his authority and law as a
   recommendation to and enjoyment of his favour and blessing.

   And as obedience and holiness is as necessary according to the law of
   faith, as it is according to the law of works, in order to
   justification and eternal life; so there is not merely as much, but
   much greater, encouragement to practise it, and the obligations and
   motives to the exercise of holiness, in love to God and man, are
   greatly increased, and rendered unspeakably greater and stronger, by
   the law of faith.

   How wholly groundless and unreasonable, and contrary to truth, fact and
   experience, is the objection to the law of faith, according to which "a
   man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the law," or not by the
   law of works, that this renders unnecessary, and is a discouragement to
   holiness and good works, and encourages licentiousness and sin!

   V. This subject opens an easy and plain way, and perhaps the only
   satisfactory and true way, to reconcile the two apostles, Paul and
   James, in what they say of that by which sinners are justified. St.
   Paul has said, "Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by
   faith, without the, deeds of the law; knowing that a man is not
   justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ."
   St. James has said, "Ye see then how that by works a man is justified,
   and not by faith only." It has been rashly thought by some that the
   apostles in these words expressly contradict each other; but their
   perfect consistence and agreement with each other will appear only by
   observing the different sense in which they use the word works, which
   is evident by all they say on the point.

   Paul expressly defines the works which he excludes from the law of
   faith, and sets in opposition to it. They are the works of the law, the
   same with the law of works, meaning works done in order to recommend to
   favour, as a price offered to purchase and merit acceptance and
   justification of God, as has been represented and explained. By works
   James means Christian holiness and obedience, which is the same with
   the law of faith, which has been explained. By works James means that
   love, in all its operations and fruits, which he says is the life and
   soul of faith, and without which there cannot be any true faith. His
   words are, "For as the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith
   without works is dead also. Seest thou how faith wrought with his
   works, and by works was faith made perfect?" How could he more strongly
   assert the holiness of laving faith, when he says that holy love, the
   root and essence of all Christian obedience and good works, is as much
   the life and active nature of a living, having faith, as the spirit is
   the life and activity of the body? How contrary is this to saying, as
   many have done, that holy love, which implies and comprehends all the
   obedience and good works of a Christian, is the effect and consequence
   of faith, and produced by faith, as the cause produces the effect!

   Paul agrees with James perfectly in his description of saving faith. He
   says, "Faith worketh by love," that is, Love, which is the essence of
   all Christian obedience, and implies all good works, is the soul and
   active life of faith, by which it operates, or acts and works, as the
   spirit is the life of the body, by which it moves and acts.

   VI. This subject may be improved by those who have attended to it, as
   affording matter by which they may examine themselves, whether their
   conversion and consequent religion be true and genuine, or false and
   spurious.

   Have you been effectually cured of a disposition to trust to your own
   righteousness, and renounced and become dead to the law of works, under
   a clear conviction that you were cursed by it, notwithstanding any
   thing you could do, and that you should be justly accursed forever,
   unless you obtained relief by the law of faith, trusting in the merit
   and righteousness of Christ for pardon and justification?

   And have you been led to understand and cordially to embrace the law of
   faith, in which you highly approved of the character of Christ, and the
   way of: salvation by him, condemning yourself as being so far from
   having or doing any thing to recommend you to God, or render you
   deserving, that you were infinitely guilty and ill-deserving?

   Have you felt and experienced this law of faith, suited to destroy your
   pride, and set you at the greatest distance from boasting, and the more
   you understood and cordially embraced this way of salvation, the more
   disposed you have been to humble yourself in the sight of the Lord?

   Do you know that your heart was naturally as much opposed to the
   gospel, as it was to the holy law of God, and that, had not God given
   you a new heart by regeneration, you should have continued an enemy to
   Christ? that the law of faith is a holy law, and that it cannot be
   complied with by a heart unfriendly to God and holiness? that the more
   you attend to and are pleased with the law of faith, the greater is
   your aversion from sin, and the more you long to be holy, and hunger
   and thirst after righteousness?

   Are you desiring and looking for that evidence that you are justified
   and shall be saved, which arises from a consciousness that you do
   embrace the gospel, and have those holy exercises which imply this, or
   are implied in conforming to the law of faith? and do you desire no
   other evidence but this, that your justification may be proved only by
   good evidence that you are sanctified?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5] This serves to fix the true and plain meaning of the Apostle's
   words, [Rom. iv. 4, 5.] "Now to him that worketh is the reward not
   reckoned of grace, but of debt: but to him that worketh not, but
   believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted to
   him for righteousness." By him that worketh is meant, him who by his
   works of obedience recommends himself to favour, and the reward of
   eternal life, and in this sense earns the reward by the price of his
   obedience, which no creature can do, except those who are perfectly
   innocent and holy, as has been observed in explaining the law of works.
   He who worketh not is the sinner, who neither has nor can have any
   works to recommend to the least favour; who is convinced of this, and
   makes no attempt to do any thing in this view and to this end; who
   feels that he is justly accursed, and under the displeasure of God, and
   deserves nothing better than everlasting destruction, being an ungodly
   rebel against God, and wholly unrighteous. As such he looks to Christ,
   and believeth on him, and cordially receives him and trusts in him for
   righteousness, who pardons and justifieth such unrighteous, ungodly,
   infinitely guilty, hell-deserving sinners as he feels and confesses
   himself to be. They who hold the tenet to which the inference under
   consideration is opposed, lay much stress upon the word ungodly in this
   passage, as if it denoted a sinner altogether destitute of the least
   friendly disposition towards God and Christ, being an impenitent enemy
   to God. But though such are often meant in the scripture by the
   ungodly, yet it does not follow that precisely this idea is always to
   be denoted by this word. It has been shewn in what sense every
   unpardoned, unjustified sinner is properly denominated ungodly, and
   this appears to be the sense in which the Apostle uses it, from the
   connection and context. And understanding it as they do, makes the
   Apostle to say that a sinner, with a hard, impenitent heart, full of
   enmity to God and to Christ, and the way of salvation by him, and
   justification by free grace, may and does believe on Christ, receive
   and trust in him for justification and salvation, which he at the same
   time abhors with his whole heart! This is to make him assert, with
   themselves, that which is most absurd and absolutely impossible. It is
   therefore most certain the Apostle did not use this word here in the
   sense which they put upon it, but in a sense perfectly agreeable to the
   subject: of which he treats, and the point he is proving, which is
   naturally and easily understood by the unprejudiced and discerning i
   being consistent with himself, with other scripture, and with the
   clearest reason.

   [6] The penalty threatened in the law of God to every transgression,
   which is endless punishment, has its foundation on the infinite evil of
   sin, and is a demonstration that it is an evil of such magnitude: for,
   if sin were not infinitely criminal, it would not deserve an infinite
   punishment, nor would it be threatened. Christ explains the meaning of
   the curie or penalty of the law, when he says, "Depart ye cursed into
   everlasting fire." They who deny the infinite evil of sin, cannot
   vindicate or understand the divine law, or the gospel, which is founded
   upon it.

   [7] The importance that this gross error, which is so unscriptural and
   absurd, and leads to so many hurtful conceptions of the law of faith,
   should be wholly discarded, has been the motive to attempt thus to
   expose and confute it. Though it has been embraced by many in the
   protestant world, and there are those who at this day contend for it,
   yet it is hoped that an effectual stop will be put to the continuance
   and spread of it. If they who have imbibed it, and are disposed
   zealously to defend it, should not be convinced of their mistake, yet
   they who have not exploded, but have been rather favourable towards it
   and the doctrines which imply it, through want of conviction of those
   truths by which it may be made to appear contrary to scripture, and a
   dangerous error, may, by attending to what has here been said, be led
   to see their mistake, and renounce it, with proper concern and zeal to
   suppress it, and vindicate the opposite truth. And they who are coming
   on the stage, and have not yet formed any opinion on this point, may be
   prevented imbibing this error, so that it may die with those who now
   embrace it, and cannot be convinced of their error, and not be handed
   down to posterity.

   [8] This subject is more largely and very particularly considered by
   Dr. Bellamy in his "Theron, Paulinus, and Aspasio; or, Letters and
   Dialogues, upon the Nature of Love to God, Faith in Christ, and
   Assurance of Eternal Life," and in his "Essay on the Nature and Glory
   of the Gospel of Jesus Christ;" which books may be recommended to all
   who desire to be well acquainted with the subject, and form their
   judgment according to the truth. This subject is also discussed by
   President Edwards, in his "Discourses on Justification by Faith alone."
   and by the author in his "System of Doctrines contained in Divine
   Revelation," vol. ii. chap. iv. section vi., "Concerning Saving Faith;
   "and section xi., "Concerning Believers' Assurance of Salvation."

SERMON XVII.

    WRITTEN IN THE YEAR I789.

   Eccl. iii. 14. I know that whatsoever God doth, it shall be forever:
   nothing can he put to it, nor any thing taken from it; and God doth it,
   that men should fear before him.

   WE may be sure that the Infinitely Great, Eternal, Omniscent Being, who
   is the First and the Last, the Almighty, does nothing for an end, or
   with a view to accomplish any design, which is temporary, and shall
   wholly cease and come to nothing, so that every thing which remains
   shall, in all respects, be just as it would have been had he not done
   it. For this would be infinitely unworthy of such a Being, infinitely
   beneath him, and unbecoming his character: it would be really more
   unbecoming and trifling, than for a man to do all he does through life
   for no end at all, were this possible; or for the greatest monarch on
   earth to spend his life in action for no higher and more important ends
   than those which children have in what they do. That which Chafes to
   exist in all its effects and consequences, so that the universe is in
   no respect; better or otherwise than if it had not been, is of
   infinitely less worth and importance, than that of which the
   consequence and good effect, or the end of which, is without end, or
   forever. Therefore the Infinitely Great, Wise and Good Being will do
   nothing but that which shall answer an end which never shall cease, so
   that the consequence and good effect of it shall exist forever.

   If this visible world were to cease to exist, and every effect and
   consequence of its having existed were to cease forever, so that no end
   were to be answered by it but what took place during the existence of
   it; and no existence, or circumstance of existence, should be in any
   respect otherwise than if it had not existed; it would have been
   created, and preserved during the existence of it, in a great measure,
   if not altogether, in vain. It is certain no end would be answered
   worthy of the Infinite Creator. There would really nothing be gained by
   such a work; all would be lost. Therefore we may be sure that none of
   the works of GOD are of this kind, but every thing that he does, will,
   in the effect and consequence of it, exist forever, or the end to be
   answered by it will never cease.

   The natural world which we behold, with all the works of man in it, is
   to come to an end, at least as to the form in which it now exists, when
   the end of the existence of it is answered, but that end which was
   designed to be accomplished by the creation and continuation of the
   existence of it will remain forever. The natural world, the sun, moon
   and stars, with this earth, and all the creatures and things contained
   in them, which are not capable of moral agency, and moral
   government--the natural world was created, and is upheld, for the sake
   of the moral world, and those creatures which are capable of moral
   government, and of conformity to God in moral exercises; as a house is
   built, not for its own sake, but for the sake of those who are to live
   in it. And when this world, having answered the end with respect to the
   moral world for which it was made and preserved, shall be burnt up, the
   moral world, and all moral agents, will continue forever, with all the
   effects and consequences of the natural world, respecting the moral
   world, which were designed to be produced by creation and providence.

   Hence it is demonstrably certain that moral agents, at least some of
   them; and if some why not all? will exist without end; for they cannot
   answer the end of their existence, and the end of all those works of
   God which he has done for their sake, if they should cease to exist:
   they must therefore exist forever.

   It will appear evident and certain, no doubt, if duly considered, that
   moral government cannot be perfectly or properly exercised, unless it
   be endless, and consequently, unless moral agents, the only subjects of
   this government, continue to exist forever. This is evident from the
   text we are considering, and what has been observed upon it. But the
   evidence of this arises from another view of this point. Moral
   government cannot be exercised without a law pointing out and requiring
   the duty of moral agents, and fixing the penalty of disobedience, and
   maintaining and executing this law, agreeable to the requirements and
   sanctions of it. The punishment which a transgression of the divine law
   deserves is endless evil or suffering; and therefore this must be the
   penalty of the law of God, and must be executed on the transgressor,
   unless something can take place to answer the same end; therefore he
   upon whom this penalty is executed, must exist forever, in order to
   suffer the penalty of the law. And although it be not essential to the
   law of God, that there should be an express promise of endless life to
   the obedient, yet the threatening of evil to the transgressor seems to
   imply favour to the obedient, and is inconsistent with putting an end
   to their existence, and depriving them of endless happiness, which in
   their view, and in reality, would bean infinite negative evil; and
   therefore must be inconsistent with the wisdom and goodness of God,
   yea, with his distributive justice; for they deserve no evil, so long
   as they continue obedient. Therefore nothing but transgression can put
   an end to the existence and happiness of a moral agent: it hence
   follows that they who persevere in obedience mutt exist happy forever,
   and they who transgress must suffer evil without end; consequently
   every moral agent must exist forever, in order to the proper and full
   exercise of moral government. Therefore whatever God does respecting
   moral agents, (and he has respect: to these in all he does) in this
   sense, shall be forever; he has a view to an endless duration, and aims
   at an end which never shall cease, but mutt exist forever.

   It has been observed, that the moral world is the end of all God's
   works; and that the subjects of moral government must exist forever;
   and that, in this sense, all that God does shall be forever. But the
   subjects of moral government, and all the events that immediately
   relate to them, do not comprehend all the moral world: God himself must
   be considered as included in this everlasting, moral kingdom, as the
   Supreme Head and Eternal King of it. And he, being infinitely greater,
   more important and worthy of regard than any or all creatures, must
   therefore be the end of all that is done: that is, he must make himself
   the highest and last end, and do all for himself, as the scripture
   asserts: "The Lord hath made all things for himself." The exercise,
   manifestation and display of his own perfections and glory must be the
   supreme end of all the works of God, which necessarily includes the
   greatest possible happiness of the obedient subjects of his moral
   kingdom; which therefore must be forever, or without end: for a
   temporary display of the Divine Glory, and the temporary happiness and
   glory of the moral kingdom of God, would be infinitely less than an
   eternal and increasing duration of these, and nothing in comparison
   with this. In this view, we see how whatsoever God doth is forever. His
   design in all he does is his own glory, in his everlasting kingdom.
   This is his end, and the issue of all is this, which shall have no end.
   The kingdom of God Is an everlasting kingdom, and of his dominion and
   glory there will be no end; which is abundantly asserted in scripture,
   we all know. And this kingdom, glory and dominion is the end of all
   God's works. Therefore every thing he doth shall be forever; it hath no
   end in his design, and in the effect and consequence. Nothing can be
   more certain than this.

   2. It is asserted in these words, that God has fixed a plan of
   operation, including all his works, all he doth or will do in time and
   to eternity; and that he is executing this plan or design in all he
   doth: all his works having reference to this, and being included in it.
   This is implied in the former particular. For if in all God doth he
   hath respect to that which is endless, he must have formed a design,
   and fixed a plan of operation, which is endless, including all he will
   do, and all events, to eternity. This the scripture abundantly asserts:
   "He worketh all things according to the counsel of his own will. The
   counsel of the Lord standeth forever, and the thoughts of his heart to
   all generations:¨ [Psal. xxxiii. 11.] "He is in one mind, and who can
   turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doth:" [Job xxiii.
   13.] "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
   world:" [Acts xv. 18.] And, if we attend to the point, we cannot but
   know that it must be so, it being impossible that it should be
   otherwise; for to suppose the contrary is to suppose God is changeable,
   which is inconsistent with infinite perfection, and with his being
   infallible, and to be trusted in all cases. Indeed, if there were not a
   Being who is unchangeable, there would be no God. Besides, if God be
   infinite in power, knowledge, wisdom and goodness, which he certainly
   is, then he is able, and could not but fix upon a plan of operation,
   including all he would do, all his works of creation and providence,
   without end, or forever. He could not but propose an end of all his
   works, and lay the wisest plan to accomplish that end. Not to do this
   must manifest want of wisdom, or of ability, an4 therefore would be
   inconsistent with infinite power and wisdom. It is impossible he should
   not know what is wisest and best to be done in every instance to
   eternity: he is able to do it, for nothing can be in the way to prevent
   his doing it: and it is equally impossible he should be infinitely wise
   and good, and not fix upon and execute the wisest and best plan of
   operation. Nothing can be more evident and certain than this. Well may
   we join with Solomon, and say, "We know, that whatsoever God doth, it
   shall be forever." He has proposed infinitely the best possible end,
   which cannot be accomplished in time, but by an everlasting series of
   works: he has fixed upon the wisest plan to answer this end, and all he
   doth has reference to this end: and the effect and consequence of all
   his works, for the sake of which they are done, will remain forever.

   Let us now proceed to consider the following words: "Nothing can be put
   to it, nor any thing taken from it." These are part of the same
   sentence, and have respect to the foregoing, and assert, that nothing
   can be put or added to what God doth, or taken from it. In these words
   the following particulars are expressed or implied; which also imply
   each other.

   1. These words contain a more strong and express declaration than the
   foregoing; That the divine plan of his endless operations, including
   every thing which he doth and will do to eternity, is unalterably
   fixed, so that it is impossible that any change or alteration should be
   made, in any respect, or in the least degree. His designs are fixed
   from eternity. He has determined what he will do, and what he will not
   do, in every instance, greater or less. And his plan admits of no
   alteration; nothing can be added to it, or taken from it. It has been
   observed, that this is abundantly asserted in scripture, and that
   reason teaches it must be so; and that to deny this, or ever doubt it,
   is to deny or doubt of the existence of a God, supreme, omnipotent,
   infinitely, intelligent, wise and good.

   2. These words imply that all things, and every event from the greatest
   to the least, from the first to the last, are included in the divine
   plan, and are unalterably fixed by the counsel and decree of God. This
   must be so, unless creatures and things may exist, and events may take
   place, independent of God, and with which his power and operation has
   no concern, without the least dependence on his determination and will,
   and, it may be, contrary to it; which no rational man can admit, as it
   is absolutely impossible.

   If all the works of God are known to him, which they could not be,
   unless he had determined and fixed what he will do; then every thing,
   every event which shall take place or exist, must be known, and
   consequently certain, and made so by the divine decree, determining
   what he would do. If any one event, even the least that can take place,
   were not fixed, but uncertain whether it will take place or not; then
   what God will do, so far as his works respect: that event, must be
   uncertain, and cannot be known or fixed. Therefore God, by determining
   his own works, equally determined and fixed what every creature should
   be and do, as the latter is necessarily included in the former. The
   divine will and operation has respect to, and concern with, every
   thing, every event, even the least that takes place; and it comes to
   pass and actually exists by some act of his, without which it could not
   take place, whether it be in the natural or moral world. The existence,
   the time and circumstances of the existence, of every bird, even the
   least, and the time and means of its beginning and ceasing to exist,
   are all fixed by what God does. Every hair of our heads, and of every
   head, and creature, that ever did or shall exist, is made by God. He
   numbers them all, and orders every circumstance, the growth, length,
   bigness, life, decay and loss, or disposal, of each one. Every tree on
   the earth, every plant, leaf and spire of grass, he produces by his
   power, energy and care. He causes every drop of rain or hail, and every
   flake of snow, that falls, and determines the bigness, the shape and
   time of the falling of each one. All these are the work of God, as are
   innumerable others, whether greater or left. These therefore must be
   all fixed front eternity, by Him who worketh all things according to
   the counsel of his own will.

   And it is equally certain that every event, and all that comes to pass
   in the moral world, depends upon the will and determination of God, and
   could not exist, if he determined and did nothing concerning it. Every
   action of moral agents, and every perception, motion and every thought
   which takes place in their hearts or minds, is comprehended in what God
   doth, and is effected by his power and operation. "The heart of the
   king," and consequently of all men, "is in the hand of the Lord, as the
   rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will." Every thing in
   the moral world, even the least motion and thought of the heart, is of
   unspeakably more importance than the events in the natural world, and
   are as much dependent on the will and operation of God; and therefore
   must be as much fixed and certain. And this is necessarily implied, in
   God's determining and fixing what he will do, so that there can be no
   alteration of his plan of operation; nothing put to it, or taken from
   it, for it comprehends all things, and all events, great and small,
   which shall take place and exist from the beginning of time, to
   eternity.

   Thus certain is it from this text, as well as from innumerable other
   passages of scripture, and from the reason and nature of things, that
   God has, by determining what he would do, necessarily "foreordained
   whatsoever comes to pass."

   3. These words assert that the divine plan of operation, which is
   endless, and includes all things and every event that ever did or shall
   take place, is the wisest and best that can be; so that to make any
   alteration in it, in any respect or the least degree, to take any thing
   from it, or add any thing to it, which is not included in it, would
   render it less perfect, wise and good. In this respect, "nothing can be
   put to it, nor any thing taken from it," without hurting or marring it,
   and rendering it less perfect, wise and good; therefore it is
   impossible there should be the least alteration, in any thing or
   circumstance, so long as God is omnipotent, infinitely wise and good.
   "His work is perfect;" which includes the whole created universe, with
   every thing from the greatest to the least, and all events and
   circumstances of events, even the most minute and inconsiderable, which
   take place in time and eternity. It is impossible it should be
   otherwise, if God be omnipotent, infinitely wise and good. The work of
   such a Being must be, like himself, absolutely perfect. He must know
   what was the most wise and best plan, and therefore the most desirable.
   He was able to form and execute such a plan, and his wisdom and
   goodness must be pleased with it: which will answer the best end, and
   includes all possible good, and excludes every thing which would render
   it less perfect, and is, on the whole, undesirable. Of this we may be
   as certain as we can be that there is a God, who is. supreme,
   omnipotent, infinitely wise and good, who hath done, and will do, what
   he pleases, in heaven and on earth, and in all the created universe,
   and that forever.

   Thus we find Solomon asserting, in the words under consideration, what
   he knew to be an important and most evident and certain truth, viz.
   that God's plan of operation is endless, is unalterably fixed, and
   comprehends all things, and all events which ever exist or take place,
   and that this divine plan, including all the created universe, and
   every event and circumstance which will take place to eternity, is most
   wise and good, being absolutely perfect; so that nothing can be put to
   it, nor any thing taken from it, without making it less perfect and
   good. This truth is abundantly asserted in divine revelation, and is
   evident to a demonstration from the reason and nature of things. And to
   deny or doubt of it, is in effect to deny or doubt of the being of a
   God, who is supreme, infinitely wise and good. This truth is concisely,
   though fully, expressed by the Assembly Divines at Westminister, in
   their shorter catechism, in the following words: "The decrees of God
   are his eternal purpose, according to the counsel of his own will,
   whereby, for his own glory, he hath foreordained whatsoever comes to
   pass. And he executeth his decrees in the works of creation and
   providence. His works of providence are, his most holy, wise and
   powerful preserving and governing all his creatures, and all their
   actions."

   This is a doctrine of divine revelation, and most agreeable to reason,
   to wisdom, and benevolence; and they who exercise these, in any good
   degree, must be pleased with it. For, according to this, nothing does
   or can take place, but that which is wisest and best, and necessary for
   the greatest general good; every thing and every event, the greatest
   and the least, being under the direction of infinite wisdom, rectitude
   and benevolence, and ordained and fixed by these. To have such a plan,
   which includes all the works of God, and every event, motion and action
   in the creation, in time and to eternity, formed by infinite wisdom and
   goodness, exactly suited to accomplish the best end, including all
   possible good, and excluding every thing which, on the whole, is
   undesirable; to have such a plan, unalterably fixed forever, so that
   nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it, must be most
   agreeable to the upright, wise and good: and that person who
   understandingly opposes it, and whose heart is displeased with it, must
   be wholly destitute of all these.

   This is suited to please the truly pious mind, to support and comfort
   such an one, and to excite all those affections and exercises in which
   true, genuine piety consists. And all the truths and facts included in
   this divine, unalterable plan, are adapted to promote and effect the
   most perfect virtue, piety and holiness: and were not this a truth,
   there could not be any such thing as piety or true religion among
   creatures.

   This leads to consider and explain the concluding words in the text, in
   which this is asserted: "And God doth it, that men should fear before
   him."

   By the fear of God, fearing him, or fearing before him, which is the
   same, is meant the exercise of that true piety and religion which is
   peculiar to good men, and distinguishes them from the wicked. In this
   sense the phrase is used in numerous places both in the Old Testament
   and the New, of which every one must be sensible who reads the Bible
   with attention and care. It is needless therefore to mention passages
   to prove it; I shall, however, cite one, which is in this book; [chap
   viii. 12, 13:] "Surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear
   God, which fear before him: but it shall not be well with the wicked,
   because he feareth not before God."

   "God doth it, that men may fear before him;" That is, he has formed
   this wise and perfect plan of operation, which is unalterable, as the
   proper and only foundation of the exercise of piety and holiness by
   creatures; and every thing God does in executing this plan is suited to
   excite and promote this, and bring it to the greater perfection, which
   is included in his endless design; and holiness shall be exercised in
   the most perfect manner and degree, and flourish under the best
   advantages, in his kingdom, forever. This is God's everlasting end, for
   which he does and orders every thing and event in the universe, viz.
   his own glory, manifested and displayed in the everlasting holiness and
   happiness of creatures, in his eternal kingdom. And the existence and
   knowledge of such a fixed and endless plan of divine operation is the
   only proper foundation for the exercise of true piety; it is suited to
   excite the exercise of holiness in creatures; and there cannot be any
   true piety which is exercised and practised in opposition to this
   truth, but all true religion is in perfect conformity with it.

   This I shall endeavour to illustrate and prove by considering what true
   piety is, by mentioning the several branches of it, in which it is
   exercised; and, at the same time, shewing that these exercises of piety
   are consistent with this truth, and naturally flow from it as the
   proper foundation of them.

   I. Love to God. is necessarily included in true piety; so that where
   there is no degree of this there is no real religion. Indeed, this
   comprehends all the exercises of piety, and is the sum and whole of it,
   as every exercise of piety, called by different names, and differing in
   some respects, are only different modifications of this same affection
   of love. Therefore love to God is required, as comprehending every
   exercise of true piety. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
   heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first
   and great commandment." That is all the affection that is required, as
   it immediately respects God, and therefore includes the whole of true
   piety. This love consists in benevolence or friendly affection towards
   God, complacency and delight in him, and gratitude to him. Benevolence
   regards him as at the head of the universe, infinitely great,
   omnipotent and supreme; all the creation being as nothing, compared
   with him, and absolutely in his hands and at his controul, made and
   used for him; He being the only necessary and all important Being, his
   interest, honour and glory being the supreme end of all, while he is
   capable of infinite felicity, and actually possesses it, being
   unchangeable in his being, perfections, designs and happiness,
   infinitely wise, righteous and good;--I say, benevolence regards God as
   such a Being, and is gratified and pleased in the highest; degree in
   such a character; and the language of the benevolent heart is, "Let God
   reign forever in unchangeable felicity and glory: let him be glorified
   by all things, and his praise be without end; let his counsel stand
   forever, and let it be impossible that any thing should exist or take
   place but what he orders, and says. Let it be: Be thou exalted, O Lord,
   above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth! Let his
   infinitely wise, righteous and benevolent will be done in heaven and
   earth, and through all his dominions, forever and ever, Amen."

   Is it not easy to see, must it not appear with irresistible evidence,
   to all who will calmly attend, that every benevolent friend of God must
   be pleased that he has laid and fixed an unalterable plan, such as best
   pleased him, comprehending every thing and all events that are
   desirable, and necessary to answer the best purpose, to eternity, he
   being, in this, independent, and infinitely above the controul of
   creatures; so that it is impossible that it should not take place, in
   every particular, and most minute circumstance, just as he has
   determined from eternity, without a possibility of his being crossed or
   disappointed in any instance? And is not all this comprehended in the
   pious, benevolent boast and exultation of the Psalmist? "But our God is
   in the heavens; he hath done whatsoever he pleased. For I know that the
   Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. Whatsoever the Lord
   pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth, in the seas, and in all
   deep places." Such a Being, prosecuting, without a possibility of any
   mistake or hindrance, such a grand, comprehensive, eternal plan, formed
   and fixed by infinite wisdom and benevolence, must be the highest
   possible obje6l of the benevolence of man, and is most perfectly, and
   to the highest degree, suited to please and gratify such an affection;
   on which it may expatiate with the highest pleasure, and without
   limitation as to the object, and with increasing strength, forever.

   But if there be no such supreme, independent Being, who is able to
   propose and effect the greatest possible good, and is infinitely
   engaged to do it, and has laid an unalterable plan, including every
   thing that is wise and good, and nothing but what is most agreeable to
   infinite benevolence, the whole being considered together, but many
   events have already taken place, the existence of which are
   disagreeable to infinite wisdom and benevolence, all things considered,
   which are not included in the most wise and benevolent plan, but have
   taken place independent of God, and exist contrary to his will that
   they should exist, and so that God will not be so much glorified nor so
   happy as he would have been had they not taken place, and there will be
   much less good in the universe forever than there might have been had
   they been prevented; then there is no God to be loved, and be the
   object of benevolent, friendly affection, which shall be completely
   pleased and satisfied in him. For he must be either impotent and
   dependent, and unable to effect that which is most agreeable to wisdom
   and goodness, and therefore is disappointed and crossed, if he be wise
   and good; or he has no wisdom or goodness, though he is omnipotent, and
   so has suffered that to take place which was not best on the whole,
   that it should exist, and is contrary to benevolence and wisdom, when
   he was able to prevent it, if he pleased. If the latter were true, all
   must acknowledge he could not be the object of love, of benevolent,
   friendly affe6lion. And if the former, and not the latter, were true,
   all must be sensible that he could not be an object with which
   benevolent affection can be pleased and satisfied: but if it were
   exercised towards him, it must be in pity and grief for him, and
   inextinguishable sorrow that he was not able to lay and prosecute the
   best plan without interruption, but is dependent, disappointed and
   crossed, and most unhappy, and must be so forever! The benevolent
   friends to such a Being, and to benevolence, must be crossed and
   miserable, in proportion to the degree of their benevolence, while the
   enemies to such a Being, were it possible there could be such an one,
   which, blessed be God! it is not, would be gratified and triumph. And
   as such a Being must be infinitely less important and glorious, he must
   be an infinitely less worthy object of benevolence, than he whom the
   truth we are vindicating describes.

   And surely every one who attends properly must see that, on this last
   supposition, such a Being could not be the object of the complacency
   and delight of a benevolent heart. This is clear, from what has been
   said respecting benevolence: for pious, holy complacency and delight in
   an object or character, is nothing different from the satisfaction and
   pleasure which benevolence has in that being or character. Therefore if
   there be any thing in a being contrary and displeasing to benevolence,
   and opposed to what that seeks, it must be equally opposed. to
   complacency and delight, and contrary to it. To impose the contrary is
   a flat contradiction.

   It is equally apparent that the God who is exhibited in our text, as it
   has been now understood and explained, mud be the first and highest
   object of complacential love, as it has been shewn that he is suited to
   gratify and please benevolence to the highest degree; for the pleasure
   which the benevolent heart takes in any object, is the same with
   complacence and delight in that object, as has been just now observed.
   Therefore that being or character with which the benevolent heart is
   most pleased and gratified, is the supreme object of complacential
   love.

   The benevolent heart must be pleased with unbounded, infinite
   benevolence, clothed with, omnipotence, fixing and executing an endless
   plan, including the highest possible good, in which God will be
   glorified in the. highest degree, and his servants and kingdom most
   happy and glorious forever, and which admits no evil but that which is
   necessary to answer the best end, and promote the greatest good, and
   render the system, the universal plan, infinitely better, more wise and
   beautiful, than it could be, were the evil excluded. Such a Being, of
   unchangeable perfection, infinite benevolence, wisdom, rectitude, truth
   and faithfulness, must be embraced by the benevolent heart, with the
   warmest and most strong affection; he must be chosen as the supreme
   good, as the object of the highest complacence and delight. God is
   exhibited to such a mind as such a Being, and in this amiable light, in
   forming and executing such a plan, comprehending all possible good, and
   including every thing that exists, and every event that shall take
   place to eternity; being exactly suited, in every respect, to manifest
   and display the divine perfection and glory, in the felicity and glory
   of his eternal kingdom, and which could not be altered, in the least
   degree, without rendering it less perfect and good. On this Being, and
   on such a system, including all things that exist, or shall take
   place--on this absolutely and infinitely perfect Being, and his
   all-perfect work, the pious mind will dwell with increasing
   satisfaction and ever fresh delight forever and ever. But were there no
   unchangeable God, absolutely independent and sovereign, and doing
   whatsoever he pleases, forming and executing the wisest and best plan
   of operation to eternity, and including and fixing every event, there
   would be no such object of supreme affection and delight to the pious,
   benevolent mind, to be embraced with unreserved love, and unlimited or
   unalloyed satisfaction and pleasure. Yea, were this God and his plan of
   operation capable of any possible alteration or change, to eternity, it
   would give pain to the benevolent heart, and be an eternal impediment
   to perfect love and happiness.

   The person whose heart is wholly selfish, and knows not what
   disinterested love means, and whose mind is consequently contracted
   down to his own little self, and fixed on his own personal concerns,
   does not extend his thoughts and affections to those grand objects, the
   glory of God, and the greatest general good of the universe. lie really
   loves nothing but himself; and he cannot be pleased with a God on whom
   he is wholly dependent, unless he knows, or thinks he knows, that he is
   wholly devoted to his interest, and will accomplish all his selfish
   desires and wishes. He must be displeased with, he must hate, a God who
   is of one mind, and cannot be turned by him; who has fixed his plan of
   working, including every thing that takes place; and who is
   unchangeably seeking the greatest general good of the universe, however
   inconsistent this may be with his particular interest and happiness;
   and who will not regard that, but give it up, whenever the greatest
   public good requires it; being determined, without a possibility of
   change, to punish forever every persevering enemy to his character and
   government. Such a creature cannot love any God, unless he will conform
   to his will, and is, in some measure at least, dependent on him, and
   waits on him to know what he will choose and do, independent of God,
   before he can determine any thing respecting him; so that he himself
   shall independently turn the scale in every thing that concerns
   himself; and God must attend him as his tool or servant, to consult his
   interest, and answer his ends. The language of his heart is, "I would
   not have a God absolutely independent, and unchangeable in his designs
   and decrees, respecting me and my interest. What is the glory of God,
   and the general good, to me, if my own personal interest and happiness
   be not regarded and included; if my selfish inclination and will be not
   gratified, but crossed? I cannot love such a God." Directly the reverse
   of this is the feeling and language of the benevolent heart, which has
   been represented above.

   I proceed to consider love as it is exercised and expressed in
   gratitude; and to shew that the God of the Bible, who worketh all
   things after the counsel of his own will, and is executing a plan in
   the most wise manner, suited to answer the best end, and which
   comprehends all his works, and every event through endless duration,
   that this God is the proper, infinite obje6b of the pious, everlasting
   gratitude of a benevolent heart. Benevolence or goodness, exercised and
   expressed, is the only object: of true, pious gratitude, and therefore
   it is found no where but in a benevolent heart, or, which is the same,
   in those who are friends to disinterested benevolence. The love of
   gratitude is essential to disinterested benevolence of a creature, as
   it is included in the very nature of it, as is the love of complacence,
   as has been shown. Wherever the benevolent mind sees the exercise of
   benevolence by any being, he is not merely pleased with it, but
   exercises gratitude towards that Being, and that whether he himself be
   the object of that benevolence, or any other being in the universe. For
   the benevolent man is a friend to universal being, capable of good; he
   wishes well to all: therefore, he who regards the good of being in
   general, and promotes the general good, or expresses his benevolence by
   doing good to any particular being, is the proper object of grateful
   love, and such benevolence is suited to excite it, and certainly will
   do it in every benevolent heart. It hence appears, that as the truth in
   our text is suited to excite the love of benevolence and complacency to
   the highest degree, as has been shewn, it will also excite true
   gratitude; and that every thing contrary to this truth, is opposed to
   the pious love of gratitude.

   When the benevolent mind sees Infinite Benevolence designing and
   effecting the greatest possible good to being in general, and promoting
   the greatest happiness of the whole, who "is good unto all, and his
   tender mercies are over all his works," and beholds him decreeing and
   doing, and causing to be done, every thing that is necessary to answer
   and effectually secure this end, this eternal purpose; he finds
   unbounded scope for the highest: and most sweet gratitude to this
   Infinitely Good Being, who is glorifying himself to the highest degree,
   and producing the greatest possible happiness in the created universe
   forever. He gives thanks to God for his infinite goodness manifested in
   his works, and in his revealed design and fixed plan, including his own
   glory, and the highest good of the created universe. His mind is
   enraptured in gratitude to God for his regard and benevolence to the
   sum of all being, Himself, the first and the last, the Almighty, in
   that he has made all things for himself, for his own glory, and is
   unalterably determined, and infinitely engaged, to glorify himself by
   all his works, and by all creatures, and in conjunction with this to
   effect the greatest possible happiness of the creation. This
   manifestation of the divine holiness, and infinite benevolence, is the
   greatest, the supreme object of the gratitude and thankfulness of the
   pious, benevolent heart.

   And when the pious, good man attends to the infinitely guilty and
   wretched state into which mankind have fallen, and how exceeding odious
   and vile they are, being total and obstinate enemies to God, his law
   and government, and violently opposed to all his benevolent designs;
   and beholds God so loving the world as to give his only begotten Son to
   save them, that whoever believes] on him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life; and that a most glorious, happy and eternal kingdom
   shall be raised out of the ruins of an apostate world, to the glory of
   divine grace; and that the greatest good shall be brought out of all
   the evil that has been, or will exist to all eternity, so that the
   issue shall be infinitely better than if there were no evil; and that
   this is all included in the eternal plan which was fixed by Infinite
   Wisdom and Goodness; when all this comes into view, it will excite the
   most sincere and strong exercises of grateful love, which will continue
   and increase forever.

   And when the pious man attends to the goodness of God to him, in
   particular, and is sensible that it is the effect of God's eternal
   counsel, and his benevolent design of good to him, and that it flows
   from him on whom he is absolutely dependent, who orders all things, so
   that his hand is to be seen in every event that takes place; all this
   is peculiarly adapted to excite his grateful love, while he says, "Not
   unto me, but unto thy name, be all the praise and glory." And what a
   foundation is here laid for holy, increasing gratitude forever!

   Gratitude to God consists in a true sense and pleasing approbation of
   the goodness of God to universal being, and to ourselves, and in making
   all the acknowledgements and returns of which we are capable, in loving
   and giving ourselves away to him, to be used for his service, glory and
   praise forever.

   The man who has no disinterested benevolence, but is wholly selfish, is
   not capable of the least degree of this true gratitude. He can love
   those who love him, but this is nothing but self love, at bottom; for
   by the supposition, he seeks himself, and is devoted to none but
   himself in all his exercises, and is not pleased with benevolence for
   its own sake, or any farther than he may reap some personal benefit by
   it, to gratify his self love. He is displeased with that goodness which
   passes by him, and does good to others, or seeks and promotes the
   general good.

SERMON XVIII.

   Eccl. iii. 14. I know that whatsoever God doth, it shall he forever:
   nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it; and God doth it,
   that men should fear before him.

   THESE words have been explained in the foregoing discourse, and the
   truths contained in them have been found to be the following: that God
   hath in his wisdom and goodness, by his unchangeable decree,
   foreordained whatsoever comes to pass; that this truth, considered in
   its extent and consequences, is the only proper and sufficient
   foundation of the true piety of men.

   The last mentioned truth is now under consideration, and has been in
   part illustrated and proved, by instancing in true love to God. We now
   proceed to consider other branches of piety, which are included in
   love, and grow out of this root or flock, and may be considered as
   different modifications of this same love; and to show that God, viewed
   as described in the text, is the only proper object of them.

   2. The fear of God is an exercise of piety. This is put in our text,
   and in many other places in holy writ, for the whole of true piety, as
   has been observed. The reason of this doubtless is, because it is in a
   peculiar manner suited to express the pious exercises of a fallen
   creature, infinitely vile and guilty, and justly exposed to eternal
   destruction, into which he will infallibly fall, unless he be rescued
   by sovereign grace, who with humility and self diffidence, knowing that
   he is wholly lost in himself, trusts wholly in Christ, the only Saviour
   of sinners, whom he has offended, and is constantly offending; yet
   trusts in him alone, even in his infinite power and sovereign goodness,
   for pardon, righteousness, holiness, strength and redemption. And thus
   it is peculiarly adapted to express the mode or manner of the pious,
   religious exercises of sinners who believe in Christ, and are friends
   to God and the Redeemer; or the holiness of repenting, believing
   sinners, that is, real Christians.

   It is plain, at the first view, that the God who is represented in our
   text, in his absolute independence, decrees and works, as it has been
   explained, is suited to lead men to fear before him, according to this
   general, comprehensive sense of fear, including the whole of piety; and
   that all those doctrines which are opposed to this, have a contrary
   tendency, and are not consistent with the fear of God, in this sense of
   it. But it may perhaps give some farther light on this subject, by more
   particularly considering the fear of God in a more restrained sense,
   and as a branch of true love or piety.

   It is of importance to observe here, that fear is used in different and
   opposite senses in the Bible; because there are two forts of fear, one,
   that which implies holy, love, and is essential to true piety; the
   other is opposed to love, and is therefore the fear of those who are
   not friends to God, but enemies. This latter is intended by fear, in
   the following passages; 1 John iv. 18. "There is no fear in love, but
   perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment: he that
   feareth, is not made perfect in love." 2 Tim. i. 7: "For God hath not
   given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound
   mind." Rom. viii. 15: "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage
   again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we
   cry, Abba, Father."

   These different kinds of fear may be in some measure illustrated by the
   following instance. An excellent father has a son and a servant, both
   of whom have been guilty of injuring him, and have fallen under his
   just displeasure. The son heartily repents, and loves his father, and
   is restored to his favour. But he keeps constantly in view the evil
   which he justly deserves, and which his father is able to inflict; he
   feels that he depends entirely upon his father's goodness for an escape
   from that evil, and that he Hands in need of his constant aid and
   assistance to preserve him from offending again, and from that evil
   which he dreads so much. Both his father's displeasure, and the evil
   consequence, are dreadful to him. He knows his father is able to punish
   in the most dreadful manner; he sees some of the family suffering the
   punishment every day, and others going in the way which will bring it
   upon them, unless they repent and reform in season; and has feelings
   answerable to what he sees. He knows he deserves to be thus punished as
   much as the worst of them, and depends entirely upon his father's
   goodness to prevent it. He loves his father with all his heart, he
   approves of his conduct, and knows he does every thing right. He loves
   to have him supreme and independent in the family, and to have him
   order every thing, and to see his will done in all cases; he loves to
   be absolutely dependent upon him, and to have all the family so: and in
   the exercise of this love, and in the views now mentioned, he humbles
   himself before his father, and fears and trembles before him.

   The servant who has offended his master, fears the rod, he dreads the
   punishment which is threatened, and knows he can inflict it; but he has
   no love to the father, his master; he wishes to be out of the family,
   and not dependent on him in any degree. He tries to pacify and please
   his master in his outward conduct, from the love of himself, because he
   fears the rod, and wishes to escape punishment. Thus he lives in
   continual slavish fear of his master, which disinterested love to him
   would cast out.

   Every one must see the difference between the filial fear of the ion,
   who loves his father, and the servile fear of the servant, who loves
   himself only; and the opposition of one to the other. And surely the
   difference and opposition between the godly fear of those who love God
   with disinterested benevolence, and the servile fear of those who do
   not love him, but are enemies to him, is much greater, and far more
   evident and striking.

   Here it may be observed, that this servile fear, by which men are
   restrained from a careless, bold practice of open sin, and their
   attention to a future state, and pressing concern to escape hell and
   obtain salvation, is excited and kept up, this servile fear is
   necessarily awakened, and fills the soul with painful concern, when
   sinners are convinced of the truth of the doctrine in our text, and are
   made in some measure to feel it to be true. So long as God, in his
   greatness, omnipresence and terrible majesty, is not in their view, and
   they do not feel or see their absolute dependence upon him for all
   good, and even to escape hell and obtain heaven, but feel as if they
   had their life in their own hands, in this respect, they will not be
   afraid of God, but live in ease and security. But when they come to
   feel that they are in the hands of God, and that he will destroy or
   save them, as he pleases, they being absolutely dependent on him, they
   will begin to fear and stand in awe of him. And the more fully
   convinced they are of the truth contained in our text, the greater will
   be their fear and terror respecting their state and situation. This
   every one can witness who has been an observer of others in these
   matters, or has attended to his own feelings. And it may be asked,
   Where has any person been found, who has disbelieved the doctrine of
   God's decrees, of his foreordaining whatsoever comes to pass, who has
   been under any soul-distressing fear of God, or of eternal destruction?

   But pious, godly fear implies love to God, in a view of his infinite
   greatness and importance, and a sense of his infinitely beautiful and
   glorious character, unchangeably wise, good, upright, just, true and
   faithful, having decreed whatsoever comes to pass, and executing his
   decrees in creating, preserving and governing all his creatures and all
   their actions, for his own glory, and the greatest good of the
   universe; or, which is the same, the greatest happiness and glory of
   his eternal kingdom. And this God, who is the supreme object of love.
   Is also the object of pious reverence and fear, as necessarily implicd
   in true love. Thus pious love and fear imply and involve each other,
   and are really but one and the same affection, which this grand and
   glorious object is suited to excite. This fear of God implies a view
   and sense of his greatness and unlimited power, of his unchangeable
   designs, and our absolute and constant dependence on him, on his will,
   in every respect, for existence and every motion, and all good, he
   being our potter, and we the clay in his hand, living, moving and
   moved, and having our being, in him. It also implies a view and sense
   of our own infinite vileness and ill-desert, and of the infinite evil
   which God is able to inflict, and may justly bring upon us; and that
   his almighty power and sovereign grace alone can prevent our being
   destroyed forever, into which destruction many have fallen, and are
   falling continually; and that we depend wholly on him, even his
   sovereign, forfeited mercy, to prevent our going to eternal ruin, and
   on his constant energy and grace, to cause us to cleave to him, and go
   in the way to heaven, we being nothing but insufficiency and vanity,
   before the Infinite All-sufficient Being; and in this view exercising
   self-diffidence, humility, and trust and dependence in God, dreading
   his displeasure above all things, and submiting to him, with a
   disposition and desire to obey him in all things forever. All this is
   implied in the true fear of God. But it may be expressed in fewer
   words, and perhaps more clearly to some minds, thus: To fear God is to
   be properly affected with his infinite greatness and terrible majesty,
   threatening and punishing his implacable enemies with everlasting
   destruction; to feel ourselves and all the creation as nothing before
   him, and wholly dependent upon him; to be suitably affected with our
   own guilt and vileness, and our absolute dependence on his sovereign,
   undeserved mercy for pardon, and the renovation of our minds to holy
   exercises.

   The whole of this is expressed or implied in the following passages of
   scripture: Luke xii. 5:--"Fear him who, after he hath killed, hath
   power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear him." All will grant
   that Christ here enjoins religious, pious fear of God, upon all who
   love him. And God is represented in his terrible majesty as the object
   of this fear, they being wholly in his hands, and dependent upon him,
   who is able, and may justly, if he pleases, cast them into hell, and
   make them miserable forever. Upon this two things may be observed:

   1. That it is here supposed that God does cast some into hell, and
   inflict eternal evil upon them. For if this could not be done
   consistent with his character and perfections, or with his known
   design, merely his having power to do that which it is known he never
   will do, and cannot do confident with his moral perfection, does not
   render him more an obje6b of religious fear, than if he had no such
   power; and it would be only an empty bugbear and scarecrow, set up to
   excite fear without any reason; which cannot be supposed. If no such
   evil, as that of being cast into hell, had existence, or ever will be
   inflicted, in any instance, then it could not be reasonably proposed as
   an object of fear.

   2. If this evil of being cast into hell be a reality, God having power
   to do it, and actually doing it, whenever and in whatever instances he
   pleases, that is, when it is necessary for his glory, and the greatest
   good of the whole; this represents God as an object of religious fear,
   to those who feel themselves in his hands, and deserving of this evil;
   even when they consider themselves as secured from suffering it, by a
   divine promise through a Mediator. For still eternal torment in hell is
   a reality, and they deserve it as much as those who are actually cast
   into it; and are constantly dependent on God's sovereign will, to be
   saved from it: and their escape from hell, and full, absolute and
   unconditional security that they shall not perish, cannot be said to be
   perfect: and completed, so long as they are on this side of heaven, in
   a state of probation, and until they are actually admitted there.
   Besides, while they, in the exercise of benevolence, behold their
   fellow Christians by profession, and their fellow men, among whom they
   live, and are uncertain that they will all escape hell, and see them in
   the hands of God, who casts them into hell, or saves them from this
   infinitely dreadful evil, as he pleases, they must have a sensation and
   exercises independent of their own personal concerns, and however
   secure they may consider themselves, which is properly called the fear
   of the Lord, and of the glory of his majesty. This is therefore
   enjoined upon all the people of God, as included in their pious
   obedience to him. [Deut. xxviii. 58:] "If thou wilt not observe to do
   all the words of this law, that are written in this book, that thou
   mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord, thy God, then the
   Lord will make thy plagues wonderful," &c.

   And an affection of this same nature and kind will be exercised by the
   inhabitants of heaven forever, as necessarily included in love to God,
   in a view of his glorious, fearful, sovereign power and majesty, and of
   themselves and all creatures, as being infinitely below him, and as
   nothing in comparison with him, and wholly dependent upon him, for
   existence, every motion of their hearts, and all good, and in a clear
   view of his terrible wrath against sinners, and the dreadful punishment
   inflicted upon them. This is represented in the 15th chapter of the
   Revelation. John saw seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in
   them is filled up the wrath of God; and at the same time he observed
   the inhabitants of heaven looking on, singing and saying, "Great and
   marvellous are thy works. Lord, God Almighty, just and true are thy
   ways, thou King of saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify
   thy name? For thou only art holy; for thy judgments are made manifest."
   I proceed to mention another passage of scripture. [Phil. ii. 12, 13.]
   "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who
   worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure." Here
   fear and trembling must mean such exercises of mind as are suitable to
   their dependence on God and his operating energy, for all things, even
   every motion of their hearts, of will and choice; for this their
   dependence on God is given as a reason why they should go on in a
   Christian course with fear and trembling: For it is God who worketh in
   you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. They were hanging over
   hell, and must drop into it, unless supported and rescued by the
   omnipotent arm of God, working in them, and forming them both to will
   and to do that which was necessary in order to escape hell and obtain
   heaven; in which God was infinitely above all controul, and acted of
   his own good pleasure, after the counsel of his own will. Here the same
   idea is held up, and the same truth expressed, with that in our text,
   as the foundation and reason of man's fearing before God, and working
   out his salvation with fear and trembling, viz. Their absolute
   dependence on God in all things, even for every thought and motion of
   heart, which he effectually causes to exist by his invisible, secret,
   almighty energy, according to his own pleasure, which must be
   unchangeable, and according to his eternal purpose, including all he
   would do to eternity in producing every thing, and ordering every
   event: so that there is but one endless chain of events, made up of
   innumerable links, of which the least existence, event and motion, and
   every circumstance, the most minute, is a necessary part, as well as
   the greatest; the whole being formed by the wise counsel and will of
   God, and entirely dependent upon him, and executed by him; and which
   cannot admit the least possible change or alteration, it being as
   firmly established and fixed as the existence and throne of the
   Almighty.

   I conclude this head with observing, that it is beyond all controversy
   certain, that the fear of God, as it has been explained, supposes our
   dependence on him, viewing him as what he is, and ourselves as what we
   are; and that, the more absolute, perfect; and universal this
   dependence is, the greater foundation there is for this fear, and this
   affection wiii be strong and constant in proportion to the view and
   sense we have of this dependence. Therefore the doctrine contained in
   our text says the best and most perfect foundation for the exercise of
   the. fear of God, and is every way suited to promote it; and every
   opinion and sentiment which contradicts this, and represents man as in
   any degree self-sufficient, and independent in any respect, is contrary
   to the true fear of God, and tends to prevent or destroy it.

   3. An entire, unreserved trust in God is an exercise of true piety, and
   essential to it. The only foundation for this is his all-sufficiency,
   his being unchangeable in. his goodness, truth and faithfulness, and
   omnipotent, supreme, or doing every thing as he pleases, and guiding
   all things by his constant, universal agency, so as to answer the most
   wise and best end. Every thing contrary to such a character is
   inconsistent with his being an object of unreserved trust and
   confidence to the pious mind. If God were not unchangeable in his
   attributes and designs, and had he not all creatures and things under
   his direction and controul; and could there be one motion or action in
   the universe independent of his direction, agency and will; and did he
   not know what is the best end, and what are the wisest and best means
   to accomplish it; and was he not unchangeably determined what he would
   do, in the exercise of infinite wisdom and goodness; the benevolent,
   pious mind would have no foundation of unreserved trust and confidence.

   But our God is not so, "He is the Rock, his work is perfect, for all
   his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity, just and
   right is he." The pious mind, feeling his absolute, entire dependence,
   and the universal dependence of all things, on this God, whom he loves
   with all his heart, puts his whole trust in him, and relies upon him
   with the most unreserved confidence, and the greatest satisfaction and
   pleasure, "He beholds the hand of God conducting all the hidden springs
   and movements of the universe, and, with a secret but unerring
   operation, directing every event," [9] so as to promote and effect the
   greatest possible good, his own glory and the greatest happiness of his
   kingdom, and of all who trust in him; and with pleasure places the
   greatest and most unreserved confidence in him, and calls all his care
   upon him. "He rests in the Lord, and waits patiently for him."

   Thus the pious, benevolent man trusts in God to glorify himself by all
   things, and all events, that take place, however dark, and of a
   contrary tendency, they may appear to him to be. And he implicitly,
   without seeing how it may be done, relies upon Him to bring good,
   unspeakable good, out of all evil; so that no event shall take place
   that shall not be best, on the whole, and all shall issue to the
   greatest advantage to his servants. and his eternal kingdom. And he
   places his hope and trust wholly in this God, for all he desires and
   wants for himself personally, and for his fellow creatures, for body or
   soul, in time and to eternity: and the language of his heart is that of
   David, [Psal. lxii. 5, &c.] "My soul, wait thou only upon God: for my
   expectation is from him. He only is my Rock and my salvation; he is my
   defence: I shall not be moved. In God is my salvation and my glory: the
   Rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. Trust in him at all
   times, ye people; pour out your heart before him, God is a refuge for
   us."

   In short, this doctrine, inculcated in our text, and taught through the
   whole Bible, being understandingly and cordially received, will pull
   down and destroy that self-confidence and self-dependence, which is
   natural to man, and with which self love inspires him; it is levelled
   directly against the selfishness and pride of man, and suited to cast
   down every high thing in his heart, which exalts itself against the
   knowledge of God; to exalt God, and humble man, and form him to cleave
   to God and the Redeemer, in a humble trust and dependence on Him alone.
   No wonder then that this doctrine is so disagreeable to those whose
   selfishness and pride have never been subdued, and has been so much
   opposed in this sinful world.

   4. An entire, unconditional resignation to the will of God, and
   pleasing acquiescence in it, is an essential part of true piety. In
   order to this, the will of God must be considered as unchangeably wise
   and good, and as wisely ordering and guiding all events to answer a
   good end; and ordering all evil as the necessary occasion and means of
   the greatest good. God cannot be omnipotent, infinitely wise and good,
   unless he has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass; and therefore on
   any other supposition there would be no foundation or reason for an
   implicit, unreserved resignation to his will. The pious, benevolent
   mind cannot acquiesce in any thing or event which is not wise and good;
   it cannot be reconciled to evil, considered in itself, only as evil;
   but in order to be pleased with its taking place, it must be considered
   in its connection with the good of which it is the occasion. Therefore
   true resignation to the will of God does suppose him to guide all the
   movements in the universe, and order all events in infinite wisdom and
   goodness. In this view, and certain of this, the language of the pious,
   benevolent heart is, "Thy will be done;" without making any exception
   or condition. Whatever evil takes place respecting himself or others,
   he is ready to espouse the language of pious Eli: "It is the Lord, let
   him do what seemeth good unto him." He with pleasure exerciseth an
   unreserved submission and resignation to the all-wise and infinitely
   good Being.

   5. Repentance towards God, and humbling ourselves in his fight for our
   sins, is included in the exercise of Christian piety. This consists in
   a sense and acknowledgment of the evil of sin, of its ill desert,
   feeling ourselves wholly blameable and answerable for it, abhorring it,
   and condemning ourselves for it, renouncing it, and turning from it; in
   which the sinner justifies God, and approves of his law, and condemns
   and takes shame to himself. This always takes place and is exercised
   in. the view of those truths, which are at least implied in the
   doctrine which we are considering. And it is impossible the heart
   should repent while it opposes this doctrine, and those truths which
   are contained in it. This can be done only by an impenitent, selfish,
   proud heart, which does always oppose and hate this doctrine, though
   the understanding and judgment may be convinced that it is true.

   The doctrine of the decrees of God, foreordaining whatsoever comes to
   pass, for his own glory and the greatest general good, necessarily
   includes his hatred of sin, and the evil and criminal nature of it, as
   it opposes. the glory of God, and the general good; and the sinner, who
   is guilty of it, does herein express his enmity against God, and the
   good which is the object of his decrees: and were the natural tendency
   and consequence of sin to take place, without being counteracted, and
   overruled to answer an end which sin and the sinner oppose, God's end
   in his decrees would be frustrated, he would be dishonoured, and good
   be destroyed by unlimited evil.

   The sinner is as blameable and criminal, as if his sin was not
   overruled for good; for the nature of it is just as bad and
   unreasonable as if no good came of it; and sin is as great a crime as
   it would be, were there no divine decrees; and in some respects
   greater: for the sinner ads as freely as he could were there no
   decrees; he has all the freedom that is in the nature of things
   possible; he acts voluntarily, and he opposes the wile, holy and
   benevolent decrees of God, and that infinitely wise, beautiful and
   benevolent plan which he has laid, and is executing, even in that very
   sin and rebellion by which he is accomplishing it. When the sinner's
   eyes are opened to see all this, he sees the evil of sin, as it is
   opposed to this infinitely great and glorious God, to all his wise and
   benevolent purposes and decrees, and to that wise, glorious and
   all-comprehending plan of his operations. He sees this, and adores, and
   his heart breaks and melts in contrition, and self-condemnation,
   humbling himself in the sight of this God. But the impenitent sinner is
   irreconcilable, and at enmity with such a God, and, in the pride and
   impiety of his heart, "replies against God," and says, "Why doth he yet
   find fault? For who hath resisted his will?"

   6. Religious joy in God, and his government and kingdom, is a branch of
   true piety. This is inculcated abundantly in the holy scripture; and
   Christians are commanded to "rejoice always in the Lord." And we have
   many examples of the religious joy of pious persons. The fruit of the
   Spirit is joy. Believers rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
   glory; and this joy no man can take from them. This is the joy of the
   benevolent heart, in the exercise of that love to God, which has been
   described above, beholding him infinitely great and most blessed
   forever, having an uncontroulable dominion over all, decreeing and
   fixing from eternity every thing, and all events, in the wisest and
   best manner, to promote and effect the most desirable and important
   end, and the greatest possible good of the whole. With this the
   benevolent mind is supported and pleased, in all the darkness, sin and
   evil which take place in this world, and in the view of what will exist
   forever in the world to come, knowing that God has ordered it all, for
   the sake of the good which he will bring out of it; that the wrath of
   man shall praise him; and the remainder of wrath, which would not
   answer this, or any good end, he will effectually restrain and prevent.
   In this view he has solid, lasting support, comfort and joy, and says,
   "The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice. Rejoice in the Lord, ye
   righteous."

   And as this truth, taken in the full latitude of it, is suited to
   support, comfort and rejoice the heart of the pious friends of God, in
   whatever Situation they may be, and whatever may be the appearance of
   things around them; so it is the only truth which can support them. If
   they give up or let go their hold of this strong foundation and prop,
   they must link into gloom, sorrow and despair. If they have no
   certainty that God cannot be disappointed in his counsel and designs,
   and that he has fixed the best plan, including all events, which cannot
   be altered for the better; if they know not but things may take place,
   which are not on the whole best, but God might have been more
   glorified, and his people more happy, had they not come to pass; and
   did they believe this to be the case; they must: sink into darkness,
   grief and sorrow, which no consideration could remove, but must abide
   on their minds forever.

   And when they behold the sin and universal apostacy of mankind, and the
   infinitely dreadful evils that are the attendants and consequence of
   this, and know that this was not accidental, or aside from the divine
   plan; but has been ordered and determined by God, that the way might be
   opened for Redemption by the Son of God, the most glorious work of God,
   by which he is glorified, the Redeemer exalted and honoured forever;
   and the redeemed made most happy in the eternal kingdom of God, in
   which they hope also to share, and behold and love and serve and praise
   this God without end; their benevolent joy rises still higher. And the
   more they contemplate this divine contrivance and plan, with all its
   appendages, and discern the manifold wisdom, and boundless goodness of
   it, the more does their joy increase, and they are ready to exclaim,
   with St. Paul, "O, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
   knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
   finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been
   his counsellor? Or who hath first; given to him? and it shall be
   recompensed unto him again. For of him, and through him, and to him,
   are all things; to whom, be glory forever. Amen,"

   The selfish man may have a great degree of religious joy; but it is
   entirely of a different nature and kind from the joy of the truly pious
   and benevolent, and there is no true piety in it; because there is no
   true respect to God in it, no disinterested regard to his glory, and
   the public, general good, or the good of others. It is the joy of the
   hypocrite, of the false hearted man, who regards and seeks himself
   only, his own supposed private, personal good. If he thinks God loves
   him, and intends to make him happy forever, this gives him great joy,
   while his mind is contracted down to his little self, and he has no
   disinterested pleasure and joy, in beholding God, in his glorious
   character and unlimited dominion, and infinite, independent felicity,
   doing whatsoever he pleases, ordering all events for his own glory and
   the general good; nor is he willing to be so dependent on God, and so
   wholly indebted to him for all good, as is implied in his foreordaining
   whatsoever comes to pass. "A brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a
   fool understand this." But the language of the pious friend of God is,
   "Thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the
   works of thy hands. O Lord, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts
   are very deep. The counsel of the Lord standeth forever, and the
   thoughts of his heart to all generations:" [Psal. xcii. 4, 5, 6;
   xxxiii. 11.] "My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: The humble
   shall hear thereof, and be glad. O, magnify the Lord with me, and let
   us exalt his name together:" [Psal. xxxiv. 2, 3.]

   7. Devotion, which consists in the worship of God, in Adoration,
   Confession, Profession, Self-dedication, Petition, Thanksgiving, and
   Praise, is a great and important branch of piety. I shall consider each
   of these parts of devotion now mentioned, and show that the doctrine
   which has been deduced from our text, and explained, is so far from
   being inconsistent with these, that it is suited to excite and promote
   them, and the only proper foundation of them.

   Adoration consists in recollecting and attending to, and, with profound
   awe and religious fear, revering, the infinitely excellent and glorious
   perfections and character of the Most High God, manifested in his
   wonderful works, and most wise and universal government, in a solemn
   address to him.

   Now, no arguments are needed to prove, that a Being of infinite
   greatness, power, rectitude, wisdom and goodness, who is above all
   controul, doing what he pleases, and ordering and directing every thing
   by his counsel and decree, with irresistible energy, to answer the best
   end--that such a Being is the only proper object of this adoration, and
   that the more clear conviction and greater impression and sense any one
   has of such a Being and character, the stronger and more fervent will
   the exercises of his heart be in humble adoration; and this is the only
   object that is suited to continue and increase it forever. And the
   thought that God might be changeable in his designs, and had not
   decreed whatsoever comes to pass, but that many things do take place
   contrary to his will, and so as to render his plan of operation less
   perfect than otherwise it would have been, must tend greatly to damp,
   if not wholly destroy, the most devout and rational adoration, and is
   inconsistent with the complete enjoyment and happiness of the devout
   mind.

   Confession of sin, unworthiness, wretchedness, absolute dependence on
   God and his sovereign grace, &c. is essential to the devotion of a
   sinner: a conviction and feeling sense of all this is implied in all
   his pious exercises, and intermixed with them.

   All this is implied in repentance, which has been considered; and it
   has been shown that the truth under consideration is suited to promote
   this. The more clear view the sinner has of the excellency of the
   divine character, of the absolute, independent supremacy of God, of his
   infinite wisdom, rectitude and goodness, and his entire dependence on
   the power and operation of God, the greater sense he must have of his
   obligation to love and obey him; and consequently of his own guilt,
   vileness and ill desert as a sinner and rebel against this God; and
   feel himself utterly lost and undone: and therefore the more freely and
   fully will he confess all this. Profession, self-dedication to God,
   Thanksgiving and praise, in which the devout worshipper of God
   expresses before him his love to him, and all the friendly, pious
   feelings of his heart; devotes himself to God, willing to serve him, to
   be, do and suffer whatever God pleases and requires, and to be used by
   him to answer his wise purposes; acknowledging the goodness of God,
   admiring and praising him for what he is, and for what he does; all
   this is grounded on the infinite perfection, and glory of the Deity,
   who is "over all God blessed forever," supreme, independent, "wonderful
   in counsel, and excellent in working;" whole energy guides every motion
   and event in the universe, according to the counsel of his own will. A
   being who is not supreme, not so powerful, wise and good, as
   necessarily to foreordain whatsoever comes to pass, could not be the
   proper object: of these devout exercises of the pious geart.

SERMON XIX.

   The same Subject continued.

   Eccl. iii. 14. I know that whatsoever God doth, it shall be forever:
   nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it; and God doth it,
   that men should fear before him.

   IN the preceding discourse the exercise of piety has been considered in
   a number of particulars. The last mentioned was devotion, and several
   things included in this have been considered. Another branch of
   devotion now requires our attention.

   Petition is that part of devotion in which we, ia our address to God,
   express our desires, or ask him to do or grant that which to us appears
   good and desirable. This requires a more particular consideration, as
   some have thought it not consistent with the doctrine of God's decrees,
   foreordaining whatsoever comes to pass; because, according to this,
   every thing is fixed, and cannot be altered. It has been said, there
   cannot be any reason or motive to pray, or make any petition, to an
   unchangeable God, whole design cannot be altered, and who has fixed all
   events, without a possibility of any change.

   Before any attempt is made to remove this objection, and supposed
   difficulty, it must be observed, that it equally lies against the
   foreknowledge of God. For if God certainly foreknows every thing that
   will take place, then every event is fixed and certain, otherwise it
   could not be foreknown. "Known unto God are all his works from the
   beginning of the world." He has determined, and passed an unchangeable
   decree, with respect to all that he will do to eternity. Upon the plan
   of the objection under consideration, it may be allied, What reason or
   motive can any one have to ask God to do any thing for him, or any one
   else, since he infallibly knows from the beginning what he will do, and
   therefore it is unalterably fixed? Therefore if it be reasonable to
   pray to an omniscient God, it is equally reasonable to pray to an
   unchangeable God. For the former necessarily implies the latter. But in
   order to show that the objection is without foundation, the following
   things must be observed.

   I. If God were not omniscient and unchangeable, and had not
   foreordained whatsoever comes to pass, he would not be the proper
   object of worship, and there would be no foundation, reason or
   encouragement to make any petition to him.

   This it is presumed will be evident to any one who will well consider
   the following observations.

   First. If there were no unchangeable, omniscient Being, there would be
   no God, no proper object of worship. A being who is capable of change
   is necessarily imperfect, and may change from bad to worse, and even
   cease to exist, and therefore could not be trusted. If we could know
   that such a being has existed, and that he was once wise and good and
   powerful, we could have no evidence that he would continue to be wise
   or good, or that he is so now, or that he is now disposed to pay any
   regard to our petitions, or is either willing or able to grant them; or
   even that he has any existence. What reason of encouragement then can
   there be to pray to a changeable being? Surely none at all. Therefore,
   if there be no reason to pray to an unchangeable God, there can be no,
   reason to pray at all.

   Secondly. If God be infinitely wise, and good, and omnipotent, supreme
   and independent; then he certainly is unchangeable, and has
   foreordained whatsoever comes to pass. This has been proved above, or
   rather is self-evident. But if he be not infinitely wise and good, &c.
   then he cannot be trusted; he cannot be the object of that trust and
   confidence which is implied, and even expressed, in praying to him.

   Thirdly. The truly pious, benevolent, devout man would not desire, or
   even dare, to pray to God for any tiling, if he were changeable, and
   disposed to alter his purpose and plan, in order to grant his
   petitions. Therefore he never does pray to any but an unchangeable God,
   whole counsel stands forever, and the thoughts of his heart to all
   generations. He is sensible that he is a very imperfect creature; that
   his heart, his will, is awfully depraved and sinful; that he knows not
   what is wisest and best to be done in any one instance; what is best
   for him, for mankind in general, for the world, or for the universe;
   what is most for the glory of God, and the greatest general good; and
   that it would be infinitely undesirable and dreadful to have his own
   will regarded so as to govern in determining what shall be done for him
   or any other being, or what shall take place. If it could be left to
   him to determine in the least instance, he would not dare to do it, but
   would refer it back to God, and say, "Not my will, but thine, be done."
   But he could not do this, unless he were certain that the will of God
   was unchangeably wise and good, and that he had decreed to do what was
   most for his own glory, and the greatest good of the whole; at the same
   time infallibly knowing what must take place, in every instance, in
   order to answer this end; and consequently must have fixed upon the
   most wise and best plan, foreordaining whatsoever comes to pass.
   Therefore, whatever be his petitions for himself, or for others, he
   offers them to God, and asks, on this condition, always either
   expressed or implied, If it be agreeable to thy will: for otherwise he
   would not have his petitions granted, if it were possible. And he who
   asks any thing of God, without making this condition, but sets up his
   own will, and desires to have it gratified, whether it be for the dory
   of God, and the greatest good of his kingdom, or not; and would, were
   it in his power, compel his Maker to grant his petition, and bow the
   will of God to his own will; he who prays to God with such a
   disposition, is an impious enemy to God, exercises no true devotion,
   and cannot be heard; and it is desirable to all the friends of God that
   he should be rejected. Resignation to the will of God always supposes
   his will is unchangeably fixed and established, which it could not be,
   unless he has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass.

   Thus it appears that if God were changeable, and had not foreordained
   whatsoever comes to pass, there would be no foundation for religious
   worship, or reason for praying to him; or that there can be no reason
   or encouragement for prayer and petition to any but an unchangeable
   God.--I proceed to observe,

   2. There is good reason, and all desirable and possible encouragement,
   to pray to an unchangeable God, who has from eternity determined what
   he will do, in every instance, and has foreordained whatsoever comes to
   pass.

   This will doubtless be evident, to him who will duly consider the
   following particulars.

   First. Prayer is as proper, important and necessary, in order to obtain
   favour from an unchangeable God, as it could be were he changeable, and
   had not foreordained any thing.

   Means are as necessary in order to obtain the end, as if nothing were
   fixed and certain. Though it was decreed that Paul and all the men in
   the ship should get safe to land, when they were in a storm at sea; yet
   this must be accomplished by means, and unless the sailors had assisted
   in managing the ship, this event could not take place, and they could
   not be saved. Prayer is a means of obtaining what God has determined to
   grant; for he has determined to give it in answer to prayer, and no
   other way. "Ask, and ye shall receive," says our Saviour. When God had
   promised to do many and great things for Israel, he adds, "Thus saith
   the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of
   Israel, to do it for them:" [Ezek. xxxvi. 37.] The granting the
   favours, which God had determined to bestow, was as much suspended on
   their asking for them, as if there had been nothing determined and
   fixed about it. There is as much regard had to prayer in granting
   favours, and the prayer is heard, and God gives them, as really and as
   much in answer to it, as if there were nothing determined and
   foreordained respecting them: for the decree includes and fixes the
   means, as much as the end; the method and way by which events are to
   take place, as much as those events themselves. The one depends on the
   other, as much as if there were no decree, and nothing fixed; yea, much
   more: for the decree fixes the dependence and connection between the
   means and the end: whereas if there were no decree, and nothing fixed,
   there would be no established connection, but all would be uncertain,
   and there would be no reason or encouragement to use means, or do any
   thing to obtain an end.

   Surely, then, there is as much reason and encouragement to pray to an
   unchangeable God, and this is as important and necessary, as if there
   were nothing fixed by the divine decrees, and much more: yea, the
   unchangeable purposes of God are the necessary and only proper ground
   and reason of prayer.

   Secondly. Though prayer is not designed to make any change in God, or
   alter his purpose, which is impossible; yet it is suited and designed
   to have an effect on the petitioner, and prepare him to receive that
   for which he prays. And this is a good reason why he should pray. It
   tends to make the petitioner to feel more and more sensibly his wants,
   and those of others for whom he prays, and the miserable state in which
   he and they are: for in prayer these are called up to view, and dwelt
   upon: and prayer tends to give a sense of the worth and importance of
   the favours asked. It is also suited to make persons feel, more and
   more, their own helplessness, and entire dependence on God for the
   favours for which they petition, of which their praying is an
   acknowledgement: and therefore tends to enhance them in the eyes of the
   petitioner, when given in answer to prayer, and to make him more
   sensible of the free, sovereign goodness of God in granting them. [10]
   In sum, this is suited to keep the exigence and character of God in
   view, and impress a sense of religious truths in general on the mind,
   and to form the mind to universal obedience, and a conscientious
   watchfulness and circumspection, in all religious exercises.

   Thirdly. It is reasonable, and highly proper and important, and for the
   honour of God, that the friends of God should express and acknowledge
   their entire dependence on him, and trust in him, for all they want for
   themselves and others, and their belief in the power, wisdom and
   goodness of God; and all this is acknowledged, expressly or implicitly,
   in prayer to God. It is also reasonable and proper that they should
   express their desire of those things which are needed by themselves or
   others, and which God alone can give or accomplish: and such desires
   are expressed in the best way and manner by petitioning for them. And
   in asking for blessings on others, and praying for their enemies, they
   express their disinterested benevolence, which is an advantage to
   themselves, and pleasing to God, even though their petitions should
   have no influence in procuring the favours which they ask. And in
   praying that God would honour himself, and advance his own kingdom, and
   accomplish all the great and glorious things which he has promised to
   do for his own honour, and the good of his people, they do not express
   any doubts of his fulfilling his promises, but are certain he will
   grant their petitions; but they hereby express their acquiescence in
   these things, and their earnest desire that they may be accomplished;
   and also profess and express their love to God, and friendship to his
   people and kingdom; and do that which the feelings of a pious,
   benevolent heart will naturally, and even necessarily, prompt them to
   do.

   . We have many examples of such petitions and prayers for those things
   and events, which the petitioners, antecedent to their prayers, knew
   would certainly, be accomplished. We have a decisive and remarkable
   instance of this in David, the King of Israel, in the following words:
   "And now, O Lord God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy
   servant, and concerning his house, establish it forever, and do as thou
   hast said. And let thy name be magnified forever, saying, The. Lord of
   hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be
   established before thee. For thou, O Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, hast
   revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore
   hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer before thee.
   And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou
   hast promised this goodness unto thy servant. Therefore now let it
   please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue
   forever before thee; for thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it, and with thy
   blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed forever:" [2 Sam. vii.
   25-29.] Here David not only prays God to do that which at the same time
   he knew and acknowledges God had promised to do; and therefore it was
   established as firm as the throne of the Almighty, and decreed that it
   should take place; but he says that this promise of God, making it
   certain, was the reason, motive and encouragement to him to make this
   prayer: "Thou, O Lord, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will
   build thee an house. And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, and thy
   words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;
   therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer
   before thee." We hence are warranted to assert that it is reasonable
   and proper to pray for that which God has promised; and that the
   certainty that it will be accomplished is a motive and encouragement to
   pray for it. How greatly then do they err who think that if every event
   is made certain by God's decree, there is no reason or encouragement to
   pray for any thing!

   Our Saviour, in the pattern of prayer which lie has dictated, directs
   men to pray that God would bring to pass those events which were
   already fixed and decreed, and therefore must infallibly take place:
   "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed he thy name; thy kingdom come,
   thy will be done," &c.

   Christ himself, in the 17th chapter of John, prays for those whom the
   Father had given to him, that he would keep them through his own name,
   and that they might be one, as the Father and Son were one; might be
   kept from the evil in the world, and be sanctified through the truth;
   that they might be with him in heaven forever, and behold his glory. At
   the same time he knew that all this was made certain to them; for he
   had before said, that all that were given to him should come to him,
   and he would raise them up at the last day; that he would give unto
   them eternal life, and not one of them should perish, as none should be
   able to pluck them out of his hands, or his Father's. He prays,
   "Father, glorify thy name;" not because this event was uncertain, but
   to express his earnest desire of that which he knew was decreed, and
   could not but take place, and his willingness to give up every thing,
   even his own life, to promote this. Again, Christ prays in the
   following words: "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own
   self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was." The
   event for which Christ prays in these words was decreed from eternity,
   and the decree had been long before published, in the 2d and 110th
   Psalms. "I will declare the decree: The Lord hath said unto me, Thou
   art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give
   thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the
   earth for thy possession. Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine
   enemies thy footstool." And he had declared the certainty of that for
   which he here prays, since his incarnation. He had said, that all power
   in heaven and earth was given unto him; that "the Father had committed
   all judgment unto the Son; that all men should honour the Son, even as
   they honour the Father. St. Paul, when speaking of God, often
   introduces the following words: "To whom be glory forever, Amen;" which
   is not to be considered as a mere doxology, by which glory is ascribed
   to God; but it is rather a wish, or desire, that God may be glorified
   forever; and the Amen corroborates it: as if he had said, "Let it be
   so; this is the most ardent desire of my soul, including the sum of all
   my petitions." Here then the Apostle utters a desire and petition for
   that which he knew was decreed, and would take place.

   The last words of Christ to his church are, "Surely I come quickly."
   Upon which promise the following petition of the church, and of every
   friend of his, is presented to him: "Amen, even so come Lord Jesus."
   Here is a petition, in which all Christians join, praying Christ to do
   what he has promised; and which therefore was as certain as a declared
   decree could possibly make it: and the petition is grounded on this
   promise and decree published by Christ, in which the petitioners
   express their hearty approbation of the coming of Christ, and earnest
   desire of this important and happy event. And if it be reasonable thus
   to pray for an event which is fixed and made certain by an unchangeable
   decree, and cannot be altered, as in the instance before us; then it is
   reasonable and proper to pray for any thing or any event which appears
   to us desirable and important, though we know God is unchangeable, and
   that all things and every event are fixed by an unalterable decree.

   The apostle John says, "And this is the confidence that we have in him,
   that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us. And if
   we know that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the
   petitions that we desired of him:" [1 John v. 14, 15.] To ask for any
   thing according to his will, is to ask for those things which it is
   agreeable to his will to grant; and this is to be known only by what he
   has revealed. When we ask him to do what he has declared he will do,
   then we know we ask for that which is according to his will; and
   consequently, that we have our petitions. But it will be asked. What
   are these things? I answer, That God will glorify himself in all
   things, and make the brightest display of his perfections and character
   forever; that he will promote and effect the greatest possible good of
   the universe; that he will make his church and kingdom perfectly happy
   and glorious forever; that he will accomplish all his designs and
   predictions, and fulfil all his promises to his church and people; and
   cause all things to work for the good of those who love him; and give
   his Holy Spirit to all who ask him. These, I think, must be the things
   we ask, when we know that we pray for any thing according to the will
   of God, and consequently know that he heareth us, and that we have the
   petitions that we desired of him. But in all these instances we asks:
   for that which God has said he will do, that is, has decreed that he
   will do them. And as it has been said before, if a decree in these
   instances does not render it unreasonable or improper to pray for their
   accomplishment; then, if God has decreed whatsoever comes to pass, this
   is not in the least inconsistent with our praying for whatever appears
   to us desirable and good, and may not be contrary to the will of God to
   grant. But here it must be observed, that when we ask for any
   particular things or events which, though it may not be contrary to the
   will of God to grant, yet he has in no way revealed that it is his will
   to grant our petitions; when we ask for any such thing, we must do it
   with an express or implicit reserve--If it be according to the will of
   God. Otherwise, or if it be not according to his will, we must withdraw
   our petition, and not desire to have it granted. Resignation to the
   will of God, whatever it may be, in all such instances, is essential to
   the pious petitions of a benevolent friend of God. And by thus
   referring to the will of God, and resigning to that, desiring it may be
   done in all cases, whatever petitions we may make, we do refer to the
   decrees of God, by which he has determined what he will do in every
   particular instance; for his will and his decrees are in this case one
   and the same, being fixed and unchangeable.

   Fourthly. It is not only proper and important that the worshippers of
   God should express their desires of those things which they want, in
   praying for them; but were this not true, and were not asking for them
   the means and way of obtaining them; yet the pious friends of God would
   esteem it a privilege and enjoyment to be allowed and invited, "by
   prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, to make known their
   requests unto him." To them prayer is not a task, from which they would
   be glad to be excused, but they practise it with pleasure. They have
   great support, enjoyment and happiness in calling their cares upon God,
   and expressing the desires of their hearts to him. While others
   restrain prayer before God, and say, "What is the Almighty, that we
   should serve him? and what profit should we have if we pray unto him?"
   the benevolent friend of God would pray, were it only for the enjoyment
   which he has in the exercise; and says in his heart, "I will call upon
   God as long as I live." And though he is certain that God is
   unchangeable, and that nothing is done, or will come to pass, which is
   not foreordained by him, this does not tend to prevent or in the least
   abate the pleasure and enjoyment he has in making known his requests to
   God, or his desire constantly to practise it: but this truth gives him
   support and consolation, and increases his delight in calling upon God,
   and renders it more desirable and pleasant unto him: yea, were not this
   a truth, he could not find any reason for making his requests known to
   him, or any delight in doing it; and would not have any encouragement,
   or even dare, to ask for any thing, as has been observed and shewn.

   And now this matter is to be left to the judgment of every one who will
   attend to it. It is hoped that it appears evident, beyond all dispute,
   from the light in which this subject; has been now set, that the
   doctrine of God's decreeing whatsoever comes to pass is not only
   confident with all the exercises of true piety, but is the proper
   foundation for this, and is suited to excite and promote these
   exercises; and that there can be no real piety which is not consistent
   with this truth.

Improvement of the Subject.

   I. It appears from what has been said on this subject, that they who
   are in their hearts opposed to this doctrine of the decrees of God, are
   strangers to true piety, and do not fear before God. Though they may
   have exercises which they call and think to be piety and real religion,
   and it may have an appearance of it to others; vet it has nothing: of
   the real nature of true piety, but is enmity and opposition to the true
   God. They may think they love God, and are speaking for him, and to his
   honour, and in favour of religion, while they are strenuously opposing
   this doctrine, as dishonourable to God, and destructive to all virtue
   and true religion: but they are deceived, and are really opposing and
   dishonouring the true God, and denying and renouncing that truth which
   is the only foundation or true piety.

   This will, without doubt, be thought very uncharitable by many, as it
   condemns a great part of professing Christians, as destitute of true
   piety, and not real Christians. But is it the office of charity to give
   up the truth because it condemns ourselves or our fellow men? Is it
   uncharitable to think and speak according to the truth, and to censure
   those who are censured by the God of truth? True charity, or love,
   "rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth." If the subject
   we have been considering has been justly represented, and the truth
   established by undeniable evidence; then this inference that has now
   been made follows with the greatest certainty, and must be admitted,
   however many are censured and condemned by it, and be they who they
   may.

   It is to be carefully observed, that the inference is, "Whosoever in
   their hearts, and in the exercise of what they call piety, oppose this
   doctrine of God's foreordaining whatsoever comes to pass, have no real
   real religion." Persons may, through the prejudices of education, or
   some other way, be led to misunderstand this doctrine, and have very
   wrong conceptions of it, and imbibe prejudices against it, in their
   speculations; and yet the exercise of their hearts be in some measure
   agreeable to it, in the practice of real piety. Their piety may not
   prevent or remove all their wrong and mistaken speculations and
   conceptions on this point. But if their hearts oppose this truth, which
   is the foundation of all true piety, their hearts are not right with
   God, but they must be enemies to him, and in the gall of bitterness,
   and bonds of iniquity, whatever specious pretences they may make of
   love to God, and of devotion.

   On the other hand, persons may be right in their speculations on this
   point, and be fully convinced of the truth of this do6lrine, yea, be
   very zealous in arguing for it, and vindicating it against opposers;
   and yet never heartily submit to it, but really oppose it in their
   hearts, and be wholly strangers to every exercise of true piety.

   On the whole, he who cordially submits to this doctrine, and has
   exercises of heart answerable to it, is a pious man, and fears before
   God, whatever his speculations may be. And he whose heart opposes this
   doctrine, in the whole tenor of his exercises, is a stranger to true
   piety, though he may be orthodox in his speculative opinion. It is
   desirable, however, that every man's judgment and speculations should
   be according to the truth: and it cannot be easily accounted for that a
   person whose heart is truly pious and benevolent should continue to
   disbelieve and reject this doctrine, when under all proper and
   desirable advantages to get light and instruction, to have all his
   false conceptions of it removed, to know what it is, what is, and what
   is not, implied in it, and to learn the foundation and reason of it,
   and how expressly and abundantly, and in a variety of ways, it is
   taught and inculcated in the holy scriptures.

   And if a person under all these advantages and instructions perseveres
   in renouncing and opposing this doctrine, as very disagreeable, and
   overthrowing all religion, with an obstinacy and zeal which appear to
   proceed from the disposition and feelings of the heart, we have reason
   to fear, yea, to determine, that the heart is not right with God, and
   that such opposition flows from this root of bitterness.

   That the unrenewed, selfish, impenitent man should dislike and oppose
   this doctrine, can be easily accounted for. For it appears from what
   has been said on this subject, that it must be, of all things most
   disagreeable to him, and that to which one of such a disposition and
   character can never submit. But that he who is born of God, and has a
   humble, benevolent heart, and loves and fears God, and delights in the
   Bible, meditating therein day and night, is pleased to have God
   exalted, as a glorious, omnipotent, unchangeable, infinitely wise and
   good sovereign of the universe, and to have proud man humbled and
   abased before him; that such an one should not believe that God has
   foreordained whatsoever comes to pass, but oppose and be displeased
   with such a do6frine, is quite unaccountable.

   II. This subject teaches us the reason and importance of making the
   glory of God our supreme end in all we do.

   1. Because this is the highest, best and most important end that can be
   proposed and pursued, and therefore most agreeable to wisdom and
   benevolence.

   2. Because God himself makes this his end in all his works. This is
   asserted in the truth which is established in the foregoing discourse,
   viz. That God hath, for his own glory, foreordained whatsoever comes to
   pass; and it has been shown that this must be the supreme end of the
   infinitely wise and benevolent Being, in all he does, and that this is
   necessarily included in the assertion in our text, "That whatsoever God
   doth, it shall be forever." It is certainly reasonable that we should
   pursue the same end that God does in his works, and herein imitate him,
   as his children. If it be wise and benevolent in God to lay a plan and
   pursue it to glorify himself, to make the brightest display of his own
   perfections, wisdom and benevolence will lead us to do all for the same
   end.

   3. Because the glory of God, the greatest manifestation and display of
   the divine character and perfections, includes the greatest possible
   good of the created universe; for in producing and effecting this, the
   omnipotence, infinite wisdom and goodness of God are acted out and
   manifested to the greatest advantage, to be seen by creatures. The
   glory of God, and the greatest happiness of the creation, therefore,
   cannot be separated, as two distinct and different ends, since the one
   necessarily implies and involves the other. The highest happiness of a
   creature consists in the knowledge and enjoyment of God, in beholding,
   loving and glorifying him; and therefore the more his perfections are
   manifested to the creation, the more happy will creatures be; and the
   greater the happiness and glory of the creation is, the more is God
   glorified, the greater is the display of his power, wisdom and
   goodness. Does it not hence follow, that the glory of God implies all
   possible good, and therefore is to be fought as the supreme end? How
   reasonable and important then is it that we should with zeal and
   fervour of mind constantly aim at this end, in obedience to the
   apostolic injunction, "Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever
   ye do, do all to the glory of God!"

   4. Because he who makes the glory of God his supreme end, and
   consequently seeks the greatest good and happiness of the creation, in
   the kingdom of God, IS necessarily happy himself. His benevolence, by
   which he makes this grand object his supreme end, and places his
   happiness in the glory of God, and the greatest general good, will
   necessarily render him happy, in seeing this end completely
   accomplished, as it will be to the utmost of his wishes, and far beyond
   his present conceptions. He must necessarily share in all this good,
   when it takes place; because, by the supposition, this is his chosen
   good. And while he leeks this as the grand object of his desire and
   happiness, and is at the lame time allured that it shall be
   accomplished, he has a great degree of enjoyment. He in a measure
   enjoys the good he seeks, in the allured prospect that it will take
   place. Thus universal, disinterested benevolence, which seeks the glory
   of God, and the general good, is the only affection which can interest
   us in that good which will take place to the highest degree, and give
   us our full share in It: whereas the contrary affection, self love
   necessarily excludes from all true happiness, because the selfish
   person places not his happiness in the glory of God, and the public
   good, the happiness and glory of his kingdom; but in his own exaltation
   and private, person al good. He is, of course, an enemy to the only
   true good and happiness, and so far as that takes place he is
   necessarily excluded and unhappy.

   He therefore who, in this sense, denies himself, gives up all that
   separate, personal, private interest which self love seeks, and, in
   this sense, loses his own life, shall find or save his life; that is,
   shall be truly and eternally happy, in the exercise of disinterested
   affection to God and the members of his kingdom, which necessarily puts
   him in possession of the public good and happiness, and gives him his
   share in this social felicity, as one of the members of the society.
   But he who saves his life, that is, who, having no public,
   disinterested affection, seeks himself only, and is pursuing and
   seeking to save to himself a separate, private interest, for the sake
   of which he is ready to sacrifice and oppose the glory of God, and the
   general good--he shall lose his life; that is, shall lose or miss of
   all happiness, and must necessarily be miserable.

   Thus we see in what respects, and for what reasons, it is our
   indispensable duty, and of the highest importance to us, to make the
   glory of God our supreme end in all we do; and, by what has been
   observed, we may learn what is implied in this. It is to set this above
   every thing else; to aim at and pursue nothing but this, and what is
   implied in it; to subordinate every thing with which we are concerned
   to the glory of God; to give lip and devote ourselves, with all we have
   and are, to answer this end, without making any reserve, freely
   renouncing all supposable or possible interest or good, for ourselves
   or others, which is inconsistent with the glory of God, or which will
   not conduce to it and promote it.

   III. They who desire to know their own character, and the nature of
   their religious exercises, whether they bear the stamp of true piety,
   may examine and try themselves by what has been exhibited on this
   subject: whether the God which is revealed in the Bible, unchangeable
   in his being, perfections, designs, decrees and works, is the chosen
   and delightful object of their religious affections; of their love,
   fear, hope and trust; of their gratitude and joy; of their adoration
   and praise, to whom they make confession, and pray with perseverance
   and pleasure; and whether they are conscious that a God, who has not
   foreordained whatsoever comes to pass, could not be the object of these
   their pious affections.

   As to those who dislike and oppose this doctrine, and say, they cannot
   love and worship such a God; and yet think themselves truly pious, and
   in the way to heaven, and that they are serving and honouring God in
   their opposition to this doctrine; we will leave them to the day which
   shall try every man's work, of what sort it is; at the same time being
   certain that if their hearts and all the exercises of them do oppose
   and reject the God who has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass, and
   they live and die with such hearts, they will be found to be workers of
   iniquity, and ranked with them who "know not God, and obey not the
   gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."

   IV. Let all who believe this doctrine be concerned to live answerable
   to it, and constantly fear before this God, and live in the exercise
   and practice of every branch of true godliness; and not, as many do,
   hold the truth in unrighteousness, and pervert it to bad purposes.

   The Christian has learned to unite a conviction and sense of entire
   dependence on God, who orders and works all things according to his
   unchangeable decree, for every motion and right exercise of heart, with
   zeal and activity in religion, working out his own. salvation with fear
   and trembling, with self-diffidence, and. a sense of his own
   insufficiency for any good thing, and a humble dependence on God for
   grace to do his duty; because he knows that God worketh in him both to
   will and to do, of his own good pleasure: [Phil. ii. 12, 13,] And the
   stronger and more steady conviction he has that God overrules and
   orders all things for his own glory and the greatest good of the whole,
   even all the sin and rebellion of men, the more unreasonable and
   criminal does sin appear to him, as it is in its nature and tendency
   direct opposition to this event. And therefore the more does he loathe,
   abhor and condemn himself for his sins, and acknowledge his desert of
   eternal destruction: knowing that God's foreordaining whatsoever comes
   to pass, leaves the sinner as free a moral agent, and as inexcusable
   and criminal, as if there were no decree in the case.

   Blessed are they who understand these things, and know the only true
   God, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working; and Jesus
   Christ, whom he has sent, who exerciseth loving kindness, judgment and
   righteousness in the earth.

SERMON XX.

    WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1800.

   The sins of men are so under the direction and controul of God, as to
   glorify him, and subserve the good of his kingdom, in every instance of
   it which he suffers to take place.

   Psalm lxxvi. 10. Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the
   remainder of wrath shalt then restrain.

   IN this psalm God's care and protection of his church is celebrated. In
   the midst of all revolutions, wars, and confusions, which take place in
   the world, and the various and strong combinations of wicked men
   against his people, they are safe and happy under his care, who will
   effectually restrain all their enemies, and finally utterly defeat and
   destroy them, and give deliverance, peace and salvation to his church.

   In the words now to be considered, the absolute and universal dominion
   of God over all creatures and things, is asserted, so that he can and
   will turn all the opposition which is made to him and his government,
   however strong and violent, and however long it may continue, to
   promote his own glory, and answer the best ends possible; and all the
   sins which would not subserve these good ends, he can and will
   effectually restrain, so that they shall not exist.

   This very important and useful sentiment will be illustrated and
   established by a particular explanation of this passage of scripture,
   and the inferences to be made from it,

   "Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee," This is asserted not only
   as a truth, but as a most evident and certain truth, and of great
   importance to be believed and relied upon with the greatest confidence
   and assurance at all times, whatever seeming appearances there may be
   against it, and though we may not be able to see how it can possibly be
   true. This is expressed by the word surely, with which the sentiment is
   introduced.

   The wrath of man comprehends all the rebellion and sins of men, that
   ever have or ever will take place, by which their hatred of God and his
   law and government, and strong opposition to these, is expressed.
   Mankind, ever since they have multiplied on earth, have, in general,
   been in arms, at war with God, and with each other; and this war has in
   numerous instances been carried on with great apparent engagedness,
   wrath and fury, in some more directly against God, and in others
   immediately against each other. All this is comprehended in the wrath
   of man, in our text: and so are all the thoughts and exercises of heart
   and conduct, however private, and more or less apparent and strong,
   which are contrary to the law of God; for all these are of the same
   nature and kind with those sinful actions in which men are more
   apparently, and with greater wrath and violence, combined against God
   and each other. And all the sins of good men, whether committed before
   they were converted or after, are included in this expression, as they
   are as really in opposition to God and his law, as the most open and
   avowed rebellion and rage against him, though not so strong and
   visible. Thus, all the sins of which men are guilty, whether greater or
   less, more secret or open, under whatever form or pretence they are
   committed, are included in the wrath of man, as they are all rebellion
   against God, and a violation of his law, and opposition to his cause,
   church and kingdom; though the more open and violent opposition to the
   divine government, to the church and people of God, and to each other,
   may be more particularly intended by the expression. This is evident
   and certain, not only as all the sins of men are of the same nature and
   evil tendency, but they are all so united and combined, that if any
   instance and degree of sin is made to praise God, it must do so in
   every instance for the same reason; and if it were not so, the
   assertion in the words before us would be so partial as to be attended
   with great uncertainty, and of little use and importance in the
   application of it, as will appear in our further attention to the
   subject.

   "The wrath of man shall praise thee;" that is, shall honour and glorify
   thee. The sin of man shall, in every instance of it, be the occasion
   and made the means of the manifestation and display of the glorious
   character and perfections of God, which could not have been made to
   such advantage and in so great a degree, in any other way, had not sin
   existed in every instance in which it has done, or ever will do. This
   is not owing to the nature and tendency of sin, considered in itself;
   for it tends to directly the contrary, to dishonour him, and is a
   direct and awful opposition to the moral government, perfections and
   existence of God; but to his power, wisdom and goodness, by which he is
   able and disposed to overrule all the rebellion against him, even every
   sin which is committed, to answer his ends, and promote his own glory.

   "The remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain:" that is, that wrath and
   those sins of men which are not suited and necessary to answer this
   end, to be so governed and overruled as to praise and glorify God, he
   will effectually restrain, and not suffer it to exist. This represents
   God as the supreme, sovereign disposer of all things and events,
   ordering what shall and, what shall not exist, from the greatest to the
   least, and directing the will and actions of men in every motion and
   exertion, so that all depend upon his will whether they shall have an
   existence or not; and this includes all the sins of men, as really as
   any other event whatever. The counsel of God's own will determined
   whether there should be any such thing as sin and rebellion, and how
   much of this should exist, even just so much as should praise him, and
   no more; which necessarily includes a determination concerning every
   instance or act of sin, whether greater or less; as his determining
   that this earth should exist includes a determination how large it
   should be, of what materials it should be composed, and concerning
   every part, and every grain of sand, &c. of which it should consist.
   All this is necessarily implied in the words under consideration. For
   in determining that sin should exist, and just so much as would praise
   him, and no more, there must be a determination concerning every act of
   sin that should take place.

   The existence of the wrath of man, the continuance of it, the height to
   which it should rise, and all the consequences of it, depended as much
   upon the will of God, as did the existence of man, and of a particular
   providence to be exercised with respect to him from the first to the
   last, containing the wisest and best plan, by which God is most praised
   and glorified, and the greatest good promoted. These are so united and
   blended together, the one implying the other, that all must exist
   together, in order to form a perfectly wise plan, which shall be most
   to the glory of God, and the greatest good of the universe. For when it
   is said, the wrath of man shall praise God, it is equally asserted,
   that all the sin which does or ever shall take place shall promote the
   greatest glory and happiness of his kingdom, and of all his friends,
   who shall dwell in it forever; for their glory and happiness depend
   upon the glory of God, the manifestation and display of his glorious
   perfections, and will keep pace with this forever, the former
   necessarily taking place and riling in proportion to the greatness and
   increase of the latter, there being a necessary and infallible
   connection between them; so that whatever praises God, and serves to
   manifest and display his character and glory, equally promotes the
   happiness of all who are his friends, and the glory of his everlasting
   kingdom.

   Of all this there is the greatest assurance and certainty, expressed by
   the Psalmist in our text; but we have other strong, corroborative
   evidence of these same truths, both from the scriptures and from
   reason, which demands our careful attention.

   The scriptures will appear, beyond a possible doubt, to an attentive,
   honest mind, to be on the same plan, and to exhibit these same truths,
   from the beginning to the end. This is manifest in so many ways and
   instances that they cannot be all mentioned here. It will be sufficient
   to suggest the following: "The scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for
   this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in
   thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth." The
   wrath of Pharaoh was ordered and brought about by God in his providence
   on purpose that he might be praised and glorified; that his name, his
   character and perfections might hereby be declared thou throughout all
   the earth. "What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and make his power
   known, endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to
   destruction? Here the sin and destruction of those who perish is
   represented as ordered by God for his praise, to manifest his hatred of
   sin, and his dreadful power in punishing sinners who are finally
   impenitent.

   The innumerable predictions in the scripture of events to be brought
   about, and which have been fulfilled by millions of millions of sinful
   exercises and actions of wicked men, and predictions of many particular
   sins which men should commit, are an incontestible evidence that God
   has the direction of all the sins of men, and that none can take place
   unless by his disposal, so as to answer his ends, and promote his
   glory. Two or three instances may be mentioned to illustrate this
   remark.

   The sin of the brethren of Joseph in selling him into Egypt, and all
   their anger and wrath which led to this, was determined and ordered by
   God for good, for his own praise and glory, and the good of his church.
   Therefore, God is said to have done it, and to send Joseph into Egypt,
   meaning it all for good. And in this way the wrath of Joseph's mistress
   in Egypt, and of her husband, did praise God, and could not have taken
   place, had it not been necessary to accomplish the benevolent purpose
   of God; and they and the brethren of Joseph were restrained from all
   that wrath and sin, which would defeat the prediction by the two dreams
   of Joseph, and not answer the purpose of God, and praise him. The
   former were restrained from putting Joseph to death, as they once
   proposed. And though Potiphar's "wrath was kindled," when he heard the
   false accusation against Joseph by his wicked wife, yet his wrath was
   so restrained that he did not take away his life, which had either of
   them done, the divine plan could not have been executed.

   But the most remarkable instance of this is the sin and wrath exercised
   by men in the treatment of the Saviour of the world, and putting him to
   death in the most cruel manner. This was all particularly determined
   and appointed long before by God, and foretold by the prophets. Hear
   what they who were inspired say of this in their solemn address to God:
   "Lord, thou art God, who had made heaven and earth and the sea, and all
   tint is in them; who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said. Why
   did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? The kings of
   the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together, against the
   Lord and against his Christ. For of a truth against thy holy child
   Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the
   Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, to do
   whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done."

   All this scene of sin and wrath against Jesus Christ was determined and
   directed by the hand and counsel, the power and wisdom, of God, which
   was necessary for the greatest display of the divine perfections in the
   redemption of sinful man, which has ever been made, and could not have
   been made in any other way, and will be to his praise and glory
   forever, and the means of the unspeakably greater happiness and glory
   of all his friends, the members of his eternal kingdom.

   And all this sin was ordered, to praise and glorify God, that he might
   hereby accomplish his wise and infinitely important designs. These
   sinners were restrained, and prevented committing all those sinful acts
   which would not praise God, but, contrary to this, would counteract his
   wise purposes. Thus Herod was not able to put Christ to death in his
   infancy, when he attempted to do it. And the Jews were not allowed to
   lay their hands upon him and kill him, though they desired and often
   attempted to do it, as this would not have been to the praise of God,
   but the contrary. They were restrained from effecting their purpose,
   till the proper time came, when this horrid deed would praise God, and
   was necessary to his accomplishing the infinitely wise and important
   ends he had in view.

   And indeed there is the greatest certainty that the sins of men, in
   general, and the universal depravity, rebellion and guilt of mankind,
   were necessary in order to there being such a character as that of
   Jesus Christ the Redeemer, and the wonderful, glorious events which do
   and will take place in consequence of what he has done and suffered.
   For had there been no sin, by which the human race are fallen into a
   state of total ruin, there could not have been any Redeemer or
   redemption, by which God will be more praised and glorified than by all
   his other works. And indeed all his other works have reference to, and
   centre in, the glorious work of Redemption, and derive their chief
   glory from this, of which the sin of man laid the foundation, which
   therefore is necessary for the greatest and most bright display of the
   perfections of God, and the consequent praises from all his friends,
   and their happiness in the enjoyment of him forever.

   And as sin in general, and the most remarkable instances of it recorded
   iii scripture, some of which have been mentioned, are made to praise
   God, there is hence ground of assurance that it does so in every
   instance, and that this is true of every sin that ever has been or will
   see committed by man, and that not one sin which would not praise God
   will ever take place, had not this been expressly asserted in our text.
   And it is important to be observed, that all the natural evil which is
   the consequence of sin, which does or ever will exist, will answer this
   end, and is necessary for the brightest manifestation and display of
   the divine perfe(5lions, and consequently for the great est happiness
   of all the friends of God. This is implied in the words of the apostle
   Paul, when he says, "We are unto God a sweet favour of Christ, in them
   that are saved, and in them that perish." According to this, the gospel
   produces that which is pleasing to God in the effect it has, not only
   in them who are saved, but also that which it has on those who perish.
   It is the occasion of discovering the total depravity, and exceeding
   hardness, and strength of the obstinacy, of the human heart, in the
   uuiversal, strong and fixed disposition to reject the offers of mercy,
   which no means will overcome and subdue; which discovery could not be
   made so fully in any other conceivable way. The clear and striking
   manifestation of this will serve to display the righteousness and holy
   displeasure of God in punishing sinners with everlasting destruction,
   and inflicting a greatly aggravated punishment on those who perish
   under the gospel, as neglecters and despisers of Christ and the great
   salvation.

   The same sentiment is expressed by this Apostle m the following words:
   "What if God willing [determining] to shew his wrath, and make his
   power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath,
   fitted to destruction; and that he might make known the riches of his
   glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory?"
   Here God is represented, not only as designing to shew his power, and
   his displeasure with sinners by fitting them for destruction; but also
   by this to make known the riches of his grace, in the salvation of the
   redeemed.

   Thus it appears that there is the most clear and certain evidence from
   the holy scripture, that all the sins of men that have or ever will
   take place, with all their circumstances, attendants and consequences,
   shall praise God, shalt serve to manifest and display his perfections,
   as otherwise could not have been done, and shall be the occasion of all
   that good, that glory and happiness of his eternal kingdom, which is
   implied in this; that it is the will of God that all this sin should
   exist just as it does and will do, to answer this end, and no more;
   therefore all that sin which would not praise him, he wills shall not
   exist, and effectually restrains.

   And all this appears most reasonable, and may be argued from the being
   and perfections of God revealed in the scriptures, in so short and
   plain a way as to amount to a clear demonstration, to the reason of
   every honest, unprejudiced person who will carefully attend to the
   subject.

   God is omnipotent, and can do what he pleases. He is omniscient; his
   knowledge extends to every thing. He is infinitely wise and good. He
   sees what is the greatest good on the whole, what is the wisest and
   best end, and what are the most wise and best way and means to
   accomplish it, and is disposed, yea, has an infinite propensity, to do
   it. It is therefore certain that all things and events absolutely
   depended on his will from eternity, for their existence, and the manner
   of it; therefore the plan of all future existence, of all creatures and
   events, and the particular manner and circumstances in which they
   should exist, was in the Divine Mind from eternity. And as it must be
   the wisest and best possible plan, containing all the possible good
   that Infinite Wisdom and Goodness could devise and desire, and
   Omnipotence execute, it cannot be altered in the most minute particular
   or circumstance, to eternity. And if this were possible, it would be
   infinitely undesirable and calamitous, yea, an infinite evil. It is
   matter of the greatest joy that the work of God is perfect," being
   decreed by him from eternity; that "whatsoever God doth, it shall be
   forever; nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it;" that
   "the counsel of he Lord standeth forever, and the thoughts of his heart
   to all generations;" that "he is of one mind, and none can turn or
   disappoint him," who "worketh all things after the counsel of his own
   wise, unchangeable will."

   This leads directly to the point before us. It must be determined by
   God whether there should be any sin and rebellion under his government,
   and among mankind. This depended wholly on the will of God. He was able
   to forbid and prevent the exigence of it; and it it was contrary to
   wisdom, perfect rectitude and goodness, that is, if he saw it was not
   wisest and best, and necessary to effect the greatest good, on the
   whole, that sin should exist, he could and certainly would prevent the
   existence of it. There is therefore the greatest possible certainty,
   from the divine perfections, that sin does exist just in the manner and
   in that degree, and in every instance of it, with all the attendants
   and consequences of it which do or will take place, agreeable to the
   dictates and will of Infinite Wisdom and Goodness, as being necessary
   to accomplish the most wise and best end, the greatest possible good of
   the universe; and the sin and misery which are not necessary to promote
   this end shall never exist, as it is contrary to infinite wisdom and
   goodness that it should. We may be as sure of this, as we are or can be
   of the being and perfections of God, or of any truth whatever, or even
   of our own existence. And to disbelieve and deny, or even to doubt of
   it, tends to atheism, and is really a degree of it.

   To suppose that God has not power and skill enough to prevent the
   existence of sin, and was not able to withhold man from sinning,
   consistent with the perfect moral freedom of man, if he had chosen to
   do it, is to suppose he is really unable to govern the world agreeable
   to his will, and therefore is not to be trusted in a matter of infinite
   importance, and that he cannot be perfectly happy, but infinitely to
   the contrary, while he cannot prevent sin and misery taking place in a
   most awful, undesirable and even infinite degree, most contrary to what
   he would desire and wish, were he able to prevent it! And if God were
   not able thus to prevent the existence of any of the sins which have
   been committed by man since his creation, then he cannot be supposed to
   be able to prevent the existence of any supposed degree of sin in
   future in any moral agent; consequently therefore there can be no
   ground of assurance, or the least evidence, either from God, or from
   moral agents, or from any other quarter, that sin will not take place
   in every moral agent, even in all those who are now perfectly holy, and
   those who are holy in some degree, in the greatest strength and to the
   utmost degree of which they are capable, and that as long as they shall
   exist! On this supposition, how could God know what would take place
   among his creatures? And how can he declare and promise that sin shall
   be forever excluded from the holy angels and the redeemed from among
   men? What shall we do with the declarations and promises of this kind
   abundantly made in the Bible? Can there be any reliance upon them? And
   what reason has any one to trust in God to preserve him from sin, and
   form him to holiness, or to ask him to do this? Dreadful and horrible
   and presumptuous supposition! most unreasonable, and big with
   consequences most terrible and destructive! It leads to the exclusion
   of divine revelation, and cuts off all trust and confidence in God in
   all matters of the greatest importance, and excludes all belief of a
   particular and universal divine providence, and naturally leads to, and
   lands men in, the horrible darkness of infidelity and atheism!

   But if God be able to prevent the existence of sin, and it was wisest
   and best, on the whole, that there should be no sin, then wisdom and
   goodness must oppose the existence of it; so that to suppose that it is
   not best on the whole that sin should take place just as it does, is to
   suppose that God is neither wise nor good: for infinite wisdom and
   goodness, clothed with omnipotence, always prefer and effect that which
   is most wise and best, most for the glory of God and the greatest good
   of his eternal kingdom; and will certainly and effectually prevent the
   existence of every thing which cannot be made to promote this end. To
   deny or even to entertain the least doubt of this, and that all the sin
   with its attendants and consequences, which does or ever will exist, is
   necessary to effect the greatest good of the universe, the brightest
   display of the divine perfections, and the highest glory and happiness
   of his kingdom, is equally to deny or doubt of the infinite wisdom and
   goodness of God, and to represent him unworthy of the implicit trust
   and confidence of his creatures, and so to leave them without any God,
   or one who is rather to be dreaded, than loved and adored. How
   dishonourable to God this is, being as gloomy and shocking as atheism
   itself, every truly pious person cannot but discern and feel!

   The holy scriptures, and our reason from the perfections of God,
   therefore join in declaring this truth, and oblige us to believe and
   say, "Surely the wrath of man shall praise God, and the remainder of
   wrath he shall restrain," in the sense in which these words have been
   explained and vindicated, viz. that all the evil which has taken place,
   or ever will exist, both moral and natural, sin and misery, does take
   place, in every the least and greatest instance of it, under the
   superintendency and direction of the infinitely wise and benevolent
   will of God, as necessary to promote the greatest: possible good of the
   universe, his own glory, and the highest happiness of his moral,
   eternal kingdom. And he will restrain and prevent the existence of all
   that which is not necessary to answer this end. [11]

   This is equally true of all the sin and rebellion of the fallen angels,
   with all the attendants and consequences of this. Their sins are many
   ways connected with the sins of men. They were the wicked instruments
   of introducing sin among mankind, and are represented ill the
   scriptures, as having a great hand in all the sins which are committed
   by men, and deceiving and tempting the whole world of mankind. They are
   allowed to come down to the earth in great wrath against God and man,
   and to go forth to the whole world, to excite them to unite in horrible
   war against God. But they are in the hand of God, and under his
   restraints; and when they have done all the work he designs they shall
   do, he will call them into the bottomless pit, and shut them up, and
   set a seal upon them, that they should deceive the nations no more,
   till the proper time shall come to let them loose again. Thus the wrath
   of devils shall praise God, and the remainder of their wrath he shall
   restrain.

IMPROVEMENT.

   This subject affords matter of sufficient support, of great comfort and
   joy, to the true friends of God, in the midst of all the evil, both sin
   and misery, which may take place. The Lord reigneth, clothed with
   omnipotence, infinitely wise and good, just and true. He is above all
   controul. He hath done, and will do, whatever he pleaseth, in heaven
   and in the earth. He is infinitely above all possibility of any
   disappointment, or of being opposed so as not to accomplish all his
   designs in the best and most perfect manner. All the rebellion, sin and
   suffering of creatures, that do or ever will, take place, are so far
   from frustrating his designs, that they are intended and ordered to
   take place just as they do, as necessary to make the greatest possible
   manifedtation of his perfections, and promote the greatest: good of his
   kingdom. There is not the least sin in thought, word or deed, nor the
   least instance of pain, nor can any evil exist, greater or less, which
   is not designed to answer some good end, so that it is best that it
   should exist just as it does. Then let the friends of God rejoice in
   him who made them and all things else, and orders every event, great
   and small, for the best. Let the children of Zion rejoice in their
   King: yea, let them always rejoice.

   The Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who was once manifested in flesh, is
   received up into glory, has fat down on the throne of the universe,
   possessed of all power in heaven and earth, and having all things,
   angels, men and devils, in his hand, reigns over all, and will reign,
   till he has, in the best time and manner, completely accomplished his
   infinitely wise and good designs; destroyed the works of the devil, by
   wholly defeating, confounding and disappointing him and all who join
   with him, in all their attempts against him, and opposition to him, and
   turning all they have done or will do, and all that does or will take
   place respecting them, to answer his own ends, to the greater glory of
   God, and to make his work in the redemption of sinners more perfect and
   glorious. He having by his sufferings and obedience made an atonement
   for sin, and obtained righteousness for the justification of sinners,
   is thus exalted to give repentance and forgiveness of sins, and
   everlasting life to all who believe on his name, and come unto him;
   being able to save to the uttermost all them who come unto God by him.
   And as none of the hu-p man race will come to him, though all who hear
   the gospel are invited, unless they be drawn by the Spirit of God, and
   made willing by his power and grace, he in this exerciseth his
   sovereignty, and has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will
   he hardeneth. And his will is infinitely wise, right and good. It is
   not best that all mankind should be saved, most for the glory of God,
   and the greatest good of the whole; but, that the design of Christ in
   dying to redeem sinners may in the best manner and highest degree be
   answered, some must be given up to the destruction which they deserve;
   and who is better able to determine this, and how many and what
   individuals shall be saved, than He who is infinite in wisdom,
   rectitude and goodness, who cannot make any mistake, or do the least
   wrong to any creature? Yea, who can do it but He? Every one who has a
   spark of true wisdom and goodness will earnestly desire that He may fix
   this matter with respect to every individual; and rejoice that it is,
   and will be, done by Him. And who has a better, or any right to do
   this, than He who has made and is the absolute and only proprietor of
   all creatures? "Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same
   lump, to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour?"

   To every benevolent friend of Christ the Saviour, it is most desirable
   and pleasing that he should have all things in his hand, and save as
   many and whom he will, and leave whom he will to destruction. He has a
   peculiar right to this, since he has been at such infinite expense to
   redeem sinners, that he should accomplish the end of his sufferings and
   death in the best manner, and see of the travail of his soul and be
   satisfied, to have every thing effected with regard to the redemption
   of man so as in the highest degree to please his wisdom and goodness.
   To this end he has every creature and thing in the universe put into
   his hands, and he directs every motion and event among creatures to
   answer the purpose for which he died, which he will accomplish in the
   best manner, perfectly agreeable to infinite wisdom and goodness. He
   will save all of the human race who can be saved consistent with wisdom
   and infinite goodness. And to all who trust in him he is an almighty
   friend and protector, and will secure them from all evil, and cause all
   things to work together for their good, and will make them perfectly
   holy, and carry them through death to heaven in the best manner and
   time, and they shall inherit all things forever.

   In sum, all things and every event are constantly under the direction
   and controul of infinite wisdom, rectitude and goodness, and are
   conducted and going on in the best manner, as fast as can be, to the
   most agreeable and happy issue possible, the greatest, most bright and
   happifying exhibition of the divine character, and the highest glory
   and felicity of the everlasting kingdom of God, from which no creature
   will be excluded, but those whose presence there is inconsistent with
   the glory of God, and the greatest good of his kingdom, and therefore
   contrary to wisdom and goodness, and who do at the same time exclude
   themselves. Every thing, circumstance and event is right; and all
   conspire to promote the greatest good, and, all things considered, it
   is on the whole best that they should be just what they are, and take
   place exactly as they do. No alteration can possibly be made, without
   injuring and spoiling the divine plan, formed by infinite
   understanding, wisdom and goodness. All this is to be seen with the
   greatest certainty in the infinitely important and excellent character,
   works, and revealed designs, of the glorious Saviour of the world.

   Surely no intelligent and truly benevolent person can believe and
   realize all this without feeling a peculiar pleasure and joy, which
   will more than support him under, and counterbalance, all the evil
   which he may feel, or that is in his view. He can, with peculiar
   satisfaction and joy, say, "Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee,
   and the remainder of wrath thou shalt restrain. The Lord Jesus Christ
   reigns, let the earth rejoice. Rejoice always in the Lord, and again I
   say, rejoice evermore; for he brings the greatest good out of all evil,
   and this shall certainly be the happy issue of all. He is the rock, his
   work is perfect for all his ways are judgment; a God of truth, and
   without iniquity, just and right is He."

   Here it may be useful to attend to and answer several questions which
   may arise in the minds of some.

   Question. How can we have any joy or comfort in any or all of this,
   while we do not know, and have little or no evidence or hope, that we
   are interested in all this good, but fear that Christ does not intend
   to save us, and that we shall perish forever? If we knew we were
   Christians, and real friends to Christ, and should be saved, this would
   give us comfort and joy; but as we know not that this is true, and do
   often much doubt of it, what is all the good, which has been
   represented as the issue of all evil, to us, while we know not that we
   shall have any part in it; but may be cast off, and miserable forever?

   Answer. If you are wholly selfish, and have no desire that God may be
   glorified, and the greatest good of his kingdom promoted, and can take
   no pleasure in the prospect and assurance of this, unless you are
   certain your own personal happiness will be secured and promoted
   hereby, then this discovers and decides your state and character, that
   you are not a real friend to Christ and his church, and no true
   Christian. All your hope and thoughts of this are a mere delusion, and
   ought to be immediately dismissed. You must be born again of the Holy
   Spirit, and become new creatures, before you can be Christians. But if
   you have any true benevolence, and are friends to Christ and his cause
   and interest, and the greatest happiness of his church and kingdom, you
   cannot but have comfort, pleasure and joy in the view and assurance
   that all things and every event, however evil and of a bad tendency in
   itself, will be overruled by him for his honour and the greatest good
   of his kingdom; that his interest is secure, and will be promoted by
   every thing that takes place, without considering your own personal
   interest, whether this is secure or not. And indeed you cannot know or
   have any ground to think or hope that you have an interest in Christ,
   and shall be saved, until you have this benevolent affection towards
   Christ and his people, and are conscious that it does take place in
   your heart!; in some degree, or those exercises which imply this, or
   are implied in it. But when these exercises and benevolent affections
   take place in your hearts, and arise to such strength and constancy,
   that, when you relied upon your own views and feelings, you are
   conscious that you have them, that you are pleased and have enjoyment
   and comfort in the thought and assurance that Christ will get honour by
   all the (ins of men, and opposition made to him by men and devils, and
   the consequent ruin of those who perish, and that all will issue in the
   greatest possible good, on the whole, you will have reason to hope and
   conclude that you are friends to Christ, and shall partake in all the
   happiness and glory of his eternal kingdom, and may, in this way arrive
   to a degree of assurance of it. And this is the only proper and safe
   way of obtaining a true and well grounded hope and confidence that you
   are real Christians, and shall be saved. And as this hope increases and
   continues, your comfort and joy will be increased. But your comfort and
   joy does not so depend upon or consist in this, that, if this
   confidence and hope should give way to doubt and fear, all your comfort
   and joy would cease; you could and would even then rejoice in the
   character, glory and happiness of the Saviour, and that all things were
   conduced by him so as to answer the best end; that he would save all
   that can be saved consistent with wisdom and goodness, with his glory
   and the great est good of his church, whether you are included in that
   number or not: and if you find you can and do rejoice in this view, it
   is a good, perhaps the best evidence, that you belong to that number.

   There are too many professing Christians whose religious comfort and
   joy appear to consist wholly in a hope or confidence that they shall be
   saved; their comfort rises in proportion to the degree and strength of
   their hope, and when that sinks and fails, and is even given up, their
   comfort is all gone, and all is darkness and gloom: so that all light
   and comfort with them in their religion consists in thinking, or a
   hope, that their own personal interest is secure, and all their
   religious darkness and trouble arise from doubts of this. Their comfort
   first began in a hope and belief that they should be saved, and still
   depends wholly upon this. This does not look like the experience of
   true Christians, but to be a wholly selfish religion, as different from
   real Christian exercises, as darkness is from light.

   Question II. But must Christians pay no regard to their own interest?
   May they not feel and dread personal pain and misery? And may not their
   own sins and sufferings occasion grief and sorrow? And ought they not
   to feel for the sins and calamities of others, and the sinful, wretched
   state of mankind in general, and mourn and lament, in the view of these
   evils? Must they always be all joy and gladness, and feel no mental
   pain and sorrow?

   Answer. A Christian ought to regard his personal interest according to
   its comparative greatness and real worth; but must have no interest of
   his own, distinct and separate from the general interest, or the
   highest and best interest of the whole universe. This is the interest
   to be regarded and fought supremely, and the interest of every
   individual of this whole, according to the importance and worth of it;
   and as this must be small and inconsiderable in comparison with the
   grand interest of the whole, it must be disregarded and given up, if it
   be inconsistent with the greatest good of the whole. And he must and
   will have an aversion from and dread of personal pain and suffering, as
   it is in itself an evil; but this is consistent with rejoicing at the
   same time in the happiness of others, and in the greatest general good,
   and he will have a peculiar satisfaction and joy when he believes and
   realizes that his pain and suffering will promote the good of the
   whole, which is in all instances true by the superintending care of the
   Redeemer. Thus the apostles, when they were beaten and put to shame by
   the council of the Jews, "departed from the presence of the council,
   rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name."

   And Christians ought, and cannot but be affected with the sin and
   misery of mankind so far as it comes under their view, and to be pained
   and grieved, when they attend more particularly to it; for it is in
   itself a great, and to us incomprehensible evil, and might well fill a
   benevolent man with insupportable pain and for row, and sink him into
   the most distressing gloom and overwhelming grief, were he not certain
   that all this is under the direction and particular care and regulation
   of uncontroulable wisdom and goodness, and has taken place because it
   is necessary for the greatest good, on the whole, and no more shall
   exist than shall answer this end, the glory of God and the greatest
   possible happiness of his kingdom; so that it is on the whole best
   there should be just so much evil in the universe as there is and ever
   will be. But when he attends to this his sorrow is in a great measure
   turned into joy. And could he have as clear and comprehensive a view of
   the good that will be the issue of all. the evil that takes place, as
   the inhabitants of heaven have, all his sorrow would entirely cease,
   and nothing would interrupt or abate his pleasure and holy joy. But in
   this imperfect state, where so much evil is felt, and present before
   our eyes, and the good which will be the consequence of all this,
   though believed to be certain, is not so present and in so full and
   clear view as the evil, the latter, especially at times, will occasion
   pain and sorrow. The good man, in this very imperfect state especially,
   cannot be equally attentive to every object at the same time, and when
   his attention is particularly turned to the evils that take place, and
   his mind is impressed with them, he will have pain and sorrow, though
   he does not doubt that all things are ordered for the best, and that
   all the evil will issue in the greatest good, while the latter is more
   out of sight, or less the object of his attention, and consequently
   makes a less impression on his mind. At other times his attention is
   fixed on Christ, his character, works and designs, and the good he will
   bring out of all evil, his faith is strong, and realizes invisible
   things, that all things are going on well, and could not be better, as
   they are guided by infinite wisdom and goodness. His pain and sorrow
   are turned into comfort, joy and praise.

   Thus the Christian has his joys and sorrows in this imperfect, sinful
   state: but the latter never takes place to that degree as wholly to
   exclude the former; but in the midst of sorrow he has joy, and, in a
   sense and degree, rejoices always. So the apostle Paul "had great
   heaviness and continual sorrow in his heart," in a view of the sin and
   misery of his nation; yet in the midst of his sorrow he had matter of
   joy. Therefore he represents himself, "sorrowful, yet always
   rejoicing." And he commands Christians to rejoice in the Lord always,
   and repeats the injunction: "And again I say, rejoice. Rejoice
   evermore." And our glorious Saviour, when in a state of humiliation on
   earth, did in his human nature rejoice in spirit, in the divine will,
   and sovereign, wise disposal of all things and events, respecting the
   children of men: [Luke x. 21, 22.] Yet he wept over Jerusalem, when his
   mind was impressed with the sin and ruin of the inhabitants of that
   city. And though he rejoiced and was glad that Lazarus was dead, as it
   was necessary for the glory of God and the good of his disciples, yet
   when he saw Mary and her friends who were with her weeping, he groaned
   in spirit, was troubled, and wept.

   Question III. We believe a Christian may have such comfort and joy as
   has been described; but as some are doubtless deceived, and make great
   pretentions to this joy, who have only a false and spurious kind of
   joy, we should be glad to know how, and by what, the former may be
   distinguished from the latter?

   Answer. This may be in some measure illustrated and decided by the
   following particulars:

   1. The Christian's joy is pure, calm and serene, and is better felt
   than expressed; therefore does not make him talkative, and forward to
   tell of his joy, unless when it appears necessary for the instruction
   and benefit of others; and then he is disposed rather to speak of the
   matter and reason there is of comfort and joy, than to dwell on his own
   comfort and enjoyment. He is humble, and has a low and mean opinion of
   himself, in proportion to the degree of his comfort and joy.

   2. This joy does not tend to exclude or abate a sense of the evil of
   sin, and the ill-desert of it, and of the misery which takes place in
   consequence of it: but, on the contrary, the Christian has a clear view
   of his own sinfulness, the hatefulness of it, and of his desert of
   evil, when he rejoiceth in the Lord: his joy does not abate his sense
   of this, but rather increases it. Nor is lie insensible of the evil of
   sin in general, and of the misery that comes and will come on men for
   their sins, while he rejoices that the wrath, even all the sins and
   misery, of man, shall praise God.

   Therefore they whose religious joy arises from a belief that there is
   no great evil in sin, and that God cannot justly, or if he could, will
   not, punish it with everlasting destruction, have only a groundless and
   false

   3. This joy is so far from making persons careless, slothful and
   inactive in religion, that it is attended with directly the contrary.
   They hate sin, and endeavour to avoid it, and seek deliverance from it,
   and strive to prevent and suppress it in others as far as they have
   opportunity and ability. They are fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.
   When they rejoice that he is praised, they seek to honour and praise
   him in all possible ways. These cannot be separated, as it would imply
   an express contradiction. They not only praise God, but pray to him.
   Their comfort and joy is not inconsistent with engagedness and pleasure
   in prayer; for the latter is implied in the former. They pray for
   deliverance from all that which appears to them to be evil, and for all
   things which they judge desirable for themselves and others, and which
   appear most for the glory of God, and the advancement of his interest
   and kingdom among men.

   But, in all their desires and prayers, they are resigned to the will of
   God. They subordinate all to that, and say. If it be consistent with
   thy will--desiring that his will may be done, which they know is best,
   most wise and good, however contrary it may be to their partial views
   and particular desires. And in this resignation to the divine will, and
   acquiescence in it, there is implied an earnest desire and prayer. "Thy
   will be done," may be a strong and earnest petition, and always is so,
   when it is attended with a proper sense of the desirableness and
   importance that it should be done in all instances, as implying the
   greatest possible good, and with a disposition to rejoice in it.

   It is therefore certain that they are strangers to the joy of true
   Christians, who, under a pretence of believing that all things and
   events are fixed by the will of God, and take place in the best manner,
   and that whatever is is right and best, are wholly careless and easy
   with regard to their own state and conduct, and whatever sins and evils
   take place; have no desires to cross any of their inclinations, and to
   be virtuous and holy, living in the neglect of fervent devotion, prayer
   and praise.

   On the whole,

   This subject is suited to excite Christians to attend to and improve
   the truth contained in the text which has been explained, so as
   constantly to enjoy .the support and comfort which they need, and which
   is offered to them, in the present dark and seemingly evil state of
   things in this world. "Were it not for this truth, there would be no
   support for Christians, but their minds would be involved in the most
   painful gloom, in the view of their own sinful state, and the sin and
   misery which abound in the world, directly tending to the dishonour of
   God, and the rum of all that is desirable; attended with disorder and
   confusion, of which no bounds or end can be realized or known, or so
   much as conjectured. The good man would have no place on which he could
   set his foot, to prevent his sinking and being overwhelmed in darkness
   and despair.

   But when the Christian attends to this truth, and feels the certainty
   of it, his feet stand on a solid foundation, on a rock which cannot be
   moved: he feels calm, and has divine support and comfort, in the midst
   of the storms and raging waves which toss themselves as if they would
   overwhelm the world. He looks above all these threatening appearances,
   and beholds a serene sky, and knows the storm will soon be over, and
   the dashing waves will cease, and the sun will shine more bright and
   pleasant than if there had been no storm. The Christian, whose mind is
   firmly established in this everlasting truth, and is sure that all
   things will issue well, and that it is best they should take place just
   as they do, that good will be the issue of all the evil, though he
   cannot but be affected with the evils, moral and natural, with which he
   is surrounded, and that more or less at different times, yet will have
   sufficient support, and be filled with comfort and joy, especially at
   times, knowing that the Lord reigns, that the wrath of man shall praise
   him, and the remainder of wrath he will restrain.

   It therefore becomes Christians, as their duty and interest, to attend
   to this truth, taken in the whole extent of it, to keep it in their
   minds, and maintain a constant assurance of it, whatever appearances
   there may be to the contrary. It is to be feared that many Christians
   are greatly deficient in this. They dwell too much, if not wholly, on
   the dark Tide of things, on the evils which are in their view, and
   suffer much gloom, dejection and pain of mind, for which there is no
   good reason, and which they might escape, if they looked more at the
   bright side, presented in the truth which has been considered, and kept
   it always in view; and their tears of sorrow would be in a measure
   dried up, and succeeded by tears of joy. It is observable that
   Christians, when they meet with great disappointments and calamities,
   either personal or public, in which the interest of the church and
   religion is concerned, are obliged to make use of this truth for their
   support and comfort--"The Lord reigns, and orders every thing right and
   well," &c. And if Christians would keep this in constant view, and see
   and realize the hand of God in every event, they would have constant
   support and comfort, and live more to the glory of God. And this tends
   to destroy all contracted, selfish views and feelings, and to enlarge
   their minds, while they attend to the divine character, government and
   kingdom, and the power, wisdom and goodness by which all things in the
   universe are directed and governed. And the more they realize and are
   pleased with this, the more they resemble the inhabitants of heaven,
   and are prepared to be members of that happy society, and join with
   them in rejoicing and praising the only wise God their Saviour forever
   and ever. Amen.

   [11] This truth has been and still is greatly opposed, and many
   objections are made to it. It has been often and by many asserted, that
   if sin answers so good an end, then sin is a good thing, and the more
   there is of it the better; that this is the greatest encouragement to
   sin; and there is really no crime in sin, if so much good comes by it,
   and therefore sinners cannot be justly blamed and punished for it. And
   it has been often said by those who think and profess themselves to be
   wise, that this doctrine is inconsistent with human liberty, and really
   makes God the author of all the sin that takes place. But the truth is
   great, and must and will prevail; and the folly of all these objectors,
   who understand neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm, shall be
   manifest unto all men. It is needless to attempt to answer any of these
   objections here, as this has been publicly done over and over again. If
   any have a desire to see them answered, they may find it done, in
   President Edwards's Treatise on Freedom of Will, Dr. Well's Essay on
   Moral Agency, Dr. Edwards's Dissertation concerning Liberty and
   Necessity, the author's System of Doctrines contained in Divine
   Revelation, and his Sermons on Rom. iii. 5, 6, 7, 8.

SERMON XXI.

   The Author's Farewell to the World.

   Psalm lxxvi. 10. Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the
   remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.

   THESE words have been explained in the preceding discourse, and it
   appears that they contain the following important truth:

   That God, in his infinite wisdom and goodness, has determined that
   there should be just so much evil, both moral and natural, as has been,
   now is, and ever will be, and no more; as it is most suitable and
   necessary to make the brightest display of his perfections, and effect
   the greatest good, glory and happiness of his eternal kingdom;
   therefore it is most wise and best that all this evil should exist: and
   every instance of it, greater or less, God will overrule to answer this
   end, in the highest possible degree.

   It has been shown that this truth, being believed and properly
   improved, is a sufficient and the only foundation for the support,
   comfort and joy of the benevolent friends of God, in all the darkness,
   confusion, sin and misery with which they are surrounded.

   And now, standing on this sure, firm foundation, this immovable,
   everlasting rock, I look around, and, as far as I am able, view the
   world of mankind, and take my leave of them, expecting soon to put off
   this my tabernacle.

   I am old, having lived near fourscore years, and I know not the day of
   my death; but have no reason to think it is far distant.

   It is my earnest wish to leave a blessing behind me when I shall go
   hence: and I have the consolation to know I shall. Jesus Christ is the
   same yesterday, to-day, and forever. He lives and reigns head over all
   things to the church. He will reign till all his enemies are put under
   his feet; till he has destroyed the works of the devil, and perfectly
   completed the work of redemption; yea, he will reign forever. He will
   cause all the kingdoms of this world, in which Satan has reigned so
   long, to become his own kingdom, and all nations shall serve him, and
   be holy and happy under his influence, protection and smiles. Of this
   blessed time the Bible is full of predictions and promises. This
   blessing I leave behind me for the world to enjoy long after I am dead;
   for I am sure that the time is coming when all the families and nations
   of the earth shall be blessed in Jesus Christ. The assurance of this
   affords support and consolation to me, while I am surveying mankind in
   their present sinful and wretched state.

   It is doubtless impossible to make an exact calculation of the number
   of inhabitants now living in this world, which shall be agreeable to
   the truth, and may not err in fixing on millions less or more than do
   actually exist. But they who have attended to this point, and perhaps
   are best able to judge, have supposed that there are not less, but
   perhaps more, than eight hundred millions of people now living on
   earth: that of these, four hundred and eighty-one millions are
   Heathens; one hundred and forty millions are Mahometans; and nine
   millions are Jews. All which amount to six hundred and thirty millions.
   There remain one hundred and seventy millions, which are supposed to be
   nominal Christians. Of these, ninety millions are Papists, thirty
   millions of the Greek church, and fifty millions Protestants.

   It is not probable that this computation is exact, according to the
   truth, and some may make a different one; but this is perhaps as near
   the truth as any that can at present be made. I cannot speak to all
   these, so as to be heard, and there is but a very small number,
   compared with the whole, whom I shall ever know in this world, or who
   will know or hear of me. But I am sure to meet not only all who are now
   in the world, but all the countless millions who ever have lived, or
   shall exist hereafter to the end of the world, at the day of judgment,
   when I shall know the character of every individual person, and mine
   will be inspected and known by all.

   The earth is far from being filled with inhabitants. There is room for
   many more, probably a thousand, yea many thousands, to one of the
   present inhabitants. The earth when properly and fully cultivated, and
   the produce prudently used to answer the ends of living, would support
   a multitude of inhabitants, even beyond all our present calculation.
   Noah and his sons, and in them every generation of mankind who have
   descended from them, received a command from God to multiply and fill
   the earth. This command has not yet been properly regarded by mankind;
   but, instead of this, they have in a great measure depopulated the
   earth, by wars and cruel slaughters of each other, and the practice of
   a variety of destructive vices, by which multitudes have been
   immaturely cut off in every age. And, by reason of the great corruption
   and horrid rebellion of mankind in every age, God has been pleased to
   show his displeasure by destroying the bigger half that have been born,
   in their infancy, or the early days of youth. But the time is coming
   when a generation shall rise up who shall know and fear the Lord, and
   love their neighbour as themselves, and shall learn war no more, and
   there shall be none to destroy or hurt in all the earth: and, in the
   practice of piety and every social virtue, under the smiles of Heaven,
   they will be happy, and multiply and fill the earth.

   According to the foregoing calculation, the greater part of mankind now
   on the earth are in a state of Heathenism; and there are near as many
   Jews and Mahometans, as nominal Christians, who are professed enemies
   to Christianity, and are in as bad, yea, worse state, than are the
   heathen.

   It is the preceptive will of God our Saviour, that all men should come
   to the knowledge of the truth and be saved. He commanded his disciples
   to "go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."
   And every one to whom the gospel is preached is commanded to repent and
   believe the saving truth. It is therefore wholly owing to the
   disobedience and wickedness of man, both Christians and Heathen,
   Mahometans and Jews, Infidels and Atheists, that the gospel has not
   been preached to all mankind, and that they have not all embraced it,
   to the salvation of their souls.

   Notwithstanding man's natural disposition to oppose, hate and reject
   the gospel, and the many difficulties and dangers which hence arise, in
   attempts to spread the gospel among the Heathen and others, it is the
   duty of Christians to exert themselves, and take every proper method to
   propagate it far and wide, to the utmost of their power, looking to and
   trusting in Christ, to cause his word to run and be glorified. Love to
   Christ, and benevolence to men who are perishing in darkness and sin,
   are sufficient, if properly exercised, to induce Christians to unite in
   the prosecution of this most important affair. Christians enjoy the
   richest treasure by the gospel, and they will not diminish but increase
   their own part in it by their attempts to impart it to others.

   Within a few years past a great and extraordinary zeal and engagedness
   to propagate the gospel among the Heathen, and others who have it not
   preached to them, has appeared, and been uncommonly exerted, both in
   Europe and America. And I observe with approbation and pleasure, that
   all the societies which have been formed are agreed in the great and
   leading doctrines of the gospel, which have been called the doctrines
   of grace, or Calvinism; and that they appear, in all their
   publications, to express a spirit of true piety, and zeal to maintain
   and propagate these doctrines, and to approve of no missionaries who do
   not appear cordially to embrace them, and to be truly pious, as I am
   certain that this is the only scheme of doctrines which is consistent
   with itself, and with the Bible, and suited to convey saving truths to
   the minds of men.

   This is an important and commendable design and work, and worthy to be
   pursued with increasing zeal and steady perseverance by all Christians,
   whatever difficulties, disappointments and apparent discouragements may
   occur. And though the attempts should not be succeeded in the
   conversion of one heathen, yet they who honestly, and from truly
   Christian principles, engage in this cause, however much they risk or
   expend, and even if they lose their own lives in it, they will really
   lose nothing by it, but meet with a rich reward. And if but few souls
   shall be gathered to Christ and be saved, this will more than
   compensate for all the cost and pains that can be bestowed in the
   cause; for one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds. And though
   Israel be not now gathered, and there shall be no great and remarkable
   success at present; yet they shall be acceptable in the eyes of the
   Lord, and it will, in some way, though now unknown to us, serve to
   promote and hasten on the happy day when the Heathen shall be given to
   Christ for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
   his possession.

   In this view I rejoice when I am taking my leave of the world, and
   heartily wish success and God speed to all who are, and the many more
   who hereafter shall be, engaged in this happy, glorious work.

   Of nominal Christians above two thirds are Papists, or of the Greek
   church, and near one third are Protestants, who are not more than the
   sixteenth part of the inhabitants of the earth. The Popish church has
   corrupted the gospel, introduced innumerable superstitious institutions
   and practices, and an idolatry, in many respects more gross and wicked
   than that of the Heathen. In scripture the head of this church, the
   Pope, is called Antichrist and the Beast, who, with all his followers,
   who receive his mark, are doomed to destruction. The Greek church is
   sunk into ignorance and superstition, and have departed from the
   essential truths and duties of Christianity. We are not therefore to
   look into either of these churches for many, if any, real Christians.
   As public bodies, they will cease to exist, when real Christianity, in
   the truth and power of it, shall prevail through all the world. I
   therefore take my leave of them, as by the scripture doomed to
   destruction.

   The Protestants, who began their separation from the church of Rome in
   the sixteenth century, when what is called the reformation from Popery
   took place, under the preaching and writings of Luther and Calvin, and
   many other reformers, are now divided into various different sects,
   parties and denominations, differing in the doctrines which they hold,
   and in their manner of discipline, and in the mode of administering the
   ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper, and the proper subjects of
   these ordinances, and in the mode of worship, &c. In the time of the
   reformation, and for some time after, the body of the reformed agreed
   in the most important and fundamental doctrines of the gospel, which
   appears by their confessions of faith and catechisms, which they
   published, and are the same, as to substance, with the doctrines which
   Calvin published in his Institutions. The articles of faith of the
   church of England, formed not long after the reformation from Popery,
   are after the same model, Calvinistic. About the middle of the
   seventeenth century, a confession of faith and catechisms were formed
   by an assembly of divines, called together from England and Scotland,
   by both houses of the English parliament; which confession and larger
   and smaller catechisms were approved and ordered to be published by
   both houses of said parliament, and the parliament and general assembly
   of the church of Scotland. And they were subscribed or assented to by
   all ranks of people in England, Scotland, and Ireland. This confession
   of faith, and these catechisms, are what may be, and is generally,
   called strict Calvinism. And they have been assented to, taught and
   maintained by many to this day.

   But doctrines contrary to those contained in this confession of faith
   were introduced among Protestants not long after the reformation from
   Popery, and were considerably spread, when the above said confession
   was formed; such as are called Arminianism and Antinomianism, and those
   held by Arians and Socinians, who not only agree with Arminians in
   rejecting Calvinism, or what are called the doctrines of grace, but
   deny the divinity of Jesus Christ. These doctrines have had a great
   increase and spread among Protestants, since that time, especially in
   this century; and the prevalence of Deism, to which these doctrines
   have a direct lead, has taken place, and real, practical religion has
   decayed, and vice of almost every kind has increased and abounded in
   proportion to the propagation of these doctrines, which are opposed to
   Calvinism, and have a tendency to spread infidelity.

   About the middle of this century the attention of multitudes was
   roused, and there was a great and remarkable revival of religion, in
   Britain, Ireland and America, principally under the preaching of
   Whitefield, and those who joined with him. Great numbers were hopefully
   converted, and embraced the doctrines of Calvinism. But there was too
   great a mixture of delusion and false religion, which has continued and
   been spreading since that time, while the whole has been the mean of
   the increase of light and knowledge of the truth, by which true
   religion has been distinguished from that which is false, and the
   important doctrines of the gospel have been pointed out and vindicated,
   in opposition to the various errors which have been embraced by many,
   by the writings or preaching of those who have appeared to have come to
   the knowledge of the truth. But by far the greater part, even the body
   of the people, appear not to have partook of the benefit of this
   revival of religion; and most who lived in the time of it were
   prejudiced against it, and opposers of it, and many of those who at
   first appeared friendly to it apostatized, and either embraced errors
   and false religion, or abandoned themselves to vice and infidelity; and
   on the whole it has been the means of hardening men in sin, and against
   the truth and all true religion, and against Christianity itself; so
   that religion has been gradually decaying, in general, from that time
   to this, and the above mentioned errors, and Deism, and even Atheism,
   have been fast spreading, and greedily embraced by multitudes, in
   opposition to all truth. And vice and immorality have kept pace with
   this, as the natural effect.

   Deism and Atheism, which are near akind, as the former really implies
   the latter, and naturally runs into it, both being not only opposition
   to Christianity, but to all religion, have for a century had a rapid
   spread in Germany, and more or less in all parts of Europe. This has
   been promoted with uncommon zeal, and secret cunning, by a number of
   pretended philosophers, who, with their abettors, have at length
   effected the public expulsion of Christianity from France. And they do
   not stop here, but are determined, as soon as possible, to effect the
   extirpation of Christianity and all religion from the Christian world.
   Yea, they extend their views farther, and are attempting, as far as
   they shall have opportunity, to put an end to all religion of every
   kind, and all civil government, in every nation on earth, where there
   is any degree of these. They have extended their views to America, and
   have emissaries, both secret and more open, attempting to spread these
   pernicious principles; and there are multitudes, especially of the
   rising generation, who are prepared to receive them.

   Though there have been of late some instances of apparent revival of
   religion, both by zealously embracing and promoting Calvinism, or the
   true doctrines of the gospel, and exhibiting the power and life of
   experimental religion in practice, both in Europe and America; yet the
   great body and mass of the people are evidently fast growing more and
   more corrupt in principle and practice. But very few of the whole are
   willing to make a profession of religion, and by far the greater part
   of professors do not understand or believe the important, essential
   doctrines of the gospel, and are far from a steady, zealous conformity
   to the holy rules of it in practice, and shining as lights, in
   distinction from the world. Attending on public worship is more and
   more neglected and despised; and profanation of the sabbath is more
   common, by irreligious visits, vain companies, and walking or riding
   abroad in companies. Family religion is generally excluded; and family
   government and good order, and the religious instruction and education
   of children, are become very rare, and generally neglected; which gives
   a dark and melancholy prospect respecting the religion and morals of
   the rising and future generations. And in proportion to the neglect of
   public worship, and the profanation of the sabbath, and the increase of
   profaneness and other vices, there is an increasing desire and
   engagedness to attend the foolish, wicked and corrupting diversions of
   the stage or theatre, and other sinful assemblies and amusements.

   The present state of religion, both as to the doctrines and practice of
   those who profess to believe that Christianity is a divine institution,
   and of those who are professed infidels, affords a clear practical
   demonstration of what the Bible abundantly holds forth, viz. that true
   religion, in principle and practice, cannot be preserved and maintained
   in the world, but will soon vanish, be rejected and lost, if the
   powerful influences of the Spirit be withheld, and do not attend the
   preaching of the gospel, and the administration of the instituted
   ordinances of it, to the saving conversion of sinners, and the
   quickening, strengthening, and comfort of believers. When men remain
   under the power of the natural corruption and ignorance of their minds,
   not being born of the Spirit, and taught of God so as to come to the
   knowledge of the truth, by the renewing of their minds, their carnal
   mind, which is enmity against God, will either lead them to reject the
   gospel wholly as a mere fable, and not worthy of credit, or to corrupt
   it in the doctrines and duties which it inculcates, so as to render it
   conformable to the corrupt inclinations of their own hearts. And this
   is no new discovery, but the evidence of it has existed and been
   increasing ever since Christianity has been published to the world, by
   the treatment it has received from all to whom it has been preached,
   except those who have known and acknowledged that they were brought to
   understand and embrace it by the invisible and powerful operations of
   the Spirit of God; that, were it not for this distinguishing, sovereign
   goodness of God, and they had been left to themselves, they should not
   have believed and embraced the gospel, and discerned and loved the
   truths and duties there revealed, but should have persevered in
   ignorance and disobedience.

   This evident fact is a continual, standing evidence of two things, viz.
   that Christianity is a wise and holy institution, and from heaven, and
   that mankind are totally depraved.

   1. This is an evidence that Christianity is from heaven, and a holy
   institution; and that two ways. It is an evidence that it is from
   heaven, from its being continued and maintained in the world to this
   day, notwithstanding the great and continual opposition of mankind to
   it, and their unwearied attempts to extirpate or corrupt it. Had not
   Jesus Christ been from heaven, and was he not gone there to maintain
   his cause and church on earth, so that the gates of hell should not
   prevail against it, agreeable to his promise, by the constant exertion
   of his power and invisible influence, Christianity and the church could
   not have lived to this time, but the great truths on which the true
   church of Christ is built would have been discarded and forgotten long
   ago. And it is an evidence that Christianity and all the essential
   doctrines of it are from heaven, and that it is a holy institution,
   that it is so disagreeable and displeasing to fallen, depraved men, by
   which they are disposed to oppose and reject it, unless corrupted and
   altered so as to be agreeable to their taste, and their reigning lusts.
   Had the gospel been of men, a mere human contrivance, it would have
   been suited to the natural humour, taste, and inclinations of man, so
   that there would be no need of a supernatural change of heart in order
   to their cordial approbation of it, and compliance with the doctrines
   and precepts of it. But if it be from heaven, it must be a holy
   institution, and therefore disagreeable to fallen man. Were it suited
   to please the corrupt taste and sinful inclinations of man, it would be
   worse than nothing, and could not be from heaven. But since the true
   doctrines and precepts of Christianity are directly contrary to the
   heart and reigning inclinations of fallen man, so that he must be born
   again and be a new creature, in order to his being a friend to the
   gospel, or even understanding and believing it, it is certainly an
   excellent, holy institution, and must be from heaven. Agreeable to
   this, Christ said to the Jews, "I am come in my Father's name, and ye
   receive me not. If another shall come in his own name, him ye will
   receive." And Paul said, "If I yet pleased men, I should not be the
   servant of Christ."

   2. This is an evidence of the total depravity of mankind; not only that
   they are fallen and depraved, but that they are wholly depraved in all
   their moral powers--have not the least degree of right moral taste and
   inclination, but are wholly under the power of the contrary. As the
   scripture says, "They are altogether become filthy; there is none that
   doeth good, no not one." When a revelation comes from heaven perfectly
   wise, holy and good, and suited to relieve and save man from his
   fallen, wretched state, revealing a Saviour infinitely excellent and
   glorious, full of grace and truth, and offering complete, eternal
   salvation to every one who is willing to have it; if man had the least
   degree or spark of moral goodness or inclination; yea, if he were not
   wholly an enemy to God and every thing right and holy; he would not
   hate and reject such an offer, but gladly embrace it. Mankind would not
   join together to invent some way to corrupt and spoil it, or root it
   out of the world, were they not total and strong enemies to God and all
   that is wise and good, and consequently enemies to their own good.
   "This is the condemnation" of man, as totally corrupt and an
   exceedingly criminal enemy to God, "that light is come into the world,
   and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
   evil."

   But to return to the view which has been given of the present state of
   the world: It appears to me, as it also doth to some noted writers on
   the Revelation, that the sixth vial, mentioned Rev. xvi. 12-16, is now
   running, and began to be poured out at the beginning of the eighteenth
   century, or some years before, and will continue to run some part of
   the nineteenth century, perhaps near fifty years of it. Under this vial
   John "saw three unclean spirits, like frogs, come out of the mouth of
   the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of
   the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working
   miracles, [or wonders] which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and
   of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of
   God Almighty." Eight years ago I published a particular explanation of
   this passage in a Treatise on the Millennium. It is needless to repeat
   that. I shall only observe here, that this is a representation of the
   uncommon spread and prevalence of error and wickedness of every kind
   over all the world, among all orders of men, especially the Christian
   world, under the influence of the devil, by which men in general will
   be in an unusual degree combined, engaged and armed against the
   reigning God the Saviour, and shall produce great, strange and
   wonderful events. And when the iniquity of the world is become full,
   and men in general are ripe for destruction, God will come forth out of
   his place to punish the world for their wickedness, in a most terrible
   battle against them, by pouring the most dreadful calamities and
   destruction upon them, under the seventh and last vial of the wrath of
   God, which is represented in this chapter, verse seventeenth to the
   end, and in the nineteenth chapter, verse eleventh to the end. This
   will prepare the way for the introduction of the millennium, when the
   church of Christ shall increase and prosper, in an unexampled state of
   purity and happiness, for a thousand years.

   In the view of this present dark and evil state of the world, and the
   prospect of yet greater wickedness and more dreadful calamities which
   are to take place for ages and generations to come on the stage, I now
   take my leave of it, with a mixture of grief and joy; knowing that all
   this wrath of man shall praise God, and all the sin and misery that
   will take place is necessary for, and will issue in, the most glorious
   display of the Divine Character, and the greatest glory and happiness
   of Christ and his church; and that he will hasten an end to these evils
   in this world as fast and as soon as it can be done consistent with his
   wisdom and goodness, and so as to bring on the millennium in the best
   manner and time.

   I think their notion is entirely without foundation, yea, contrary to
   scripture, who imagine that the end of the world may come, and Christ
   come to judgment immediately, at any day or hour now. Christ has
   foretold many things which must come to pass between this time and that
   grand event. Nor, as they think, would the preaching of such a doctrine
   tend to awaken people, and prevent their going on in security and sin,
   more than what constantly takes place before the eyes of all, in the
   death of others, and reminding people that no one is secure from death
   one hour; that Christ may come when they think not, and carry them out
   of the world, which will be as fatal to them, if they are living in
   sin, as if he had come to judgment.

   Nor is their opinion founded on any reason or scripture, who think that
   but few of mankind, on the whole, will be saved. What our Saviour says
   of this respected the then present time. His words are in the present
   tense: "Few are saved." He does not say what will be in other ages of
   the world. He has foretold a time when all the kingdoms of the world
   shall be brought into his church and kingdom; and so many may exist in
   this time as to outnumber all that will be left.

   Therefore while I am taking my leave of the world of mankind, who now
   lie in the wicked one, and are going on from bad to worse, I may look
   beyond this evil time, and with pleasure hail the incalculable millions
   of holy and happy sons and daughters of Adam who shall yet arise and
   live on the earth, and be glad and rejoice in the glory of Christ and
   their salvation.

   How many and which of the nations which are now Heathen or Mahometans
   will be preserved as a distinct people through all the revolutions and
   dreadful judgments which are to take place preparatory to the
   millennium, and will be then, or before, converted, and share in the
   blessings of that day, cannot be now determined. And this is true with
   regard to the various nations now in Christendom. Some of them, and we
   know not how many, may become extinct, in the evil times that arc
   coming, and the gospel be carried to other nations, who do not now
   enjoy it. It is enough for us to know that every event and
   circumstance, with respect to this, will be ordered in the wisest and
   best manner by Christ, so as to accomplish his purpose, to glorify
   himself, and effect the greatest good of his church. As to the Jews, we
   know that mercy is in store for them. They shall, more or less of them,
   be preserved a distinct nation, through all the terrible shakings of
   the earth which are coming, down to the millennium, and have a large
   share in the blessings of that day.

   I take my leave of them, being now in a scattered, afflicted state,
   under the power of an evil heart of unbelief, in the assured, joyful
   prospect of the great good that is coming to them, when their reception
   into the church of Christ will be life from the dead, and the
   unsearchable depth of the riches both of the wisdom, goodness and
   knowledge of Christ will be forever adored by all the redeemed. Oh, how
   shall all their past and present wrath, together with their future
   reconciliation, praise Him!

   When I turn my attention to Christendom, with pain and abhorrence I
   pass over the beast, the Pope and his adherents, even all who receive
   the mark of this beast, as doomed to certain destruction: and I am
   without any assurance that those who belong to the apostate Greek
   church will escape this dreadful evil.

   But what shall I say of or to those who are called Protestants? Great
   numbers who live among Protestants have professed to disbelieve and
   renounce Christianity, and many have written against it, and attempt to
   prove that it is a mere fable, not worthy of the least credit. And
   though all they have written has been fully and often refuted, they
   persist in their infidelity, and their number appears to be greatly
   increasing, either openly or more secretly; while they are assiduously
   endeavouring to insinuate their tenets by all possible means wherever
   they can have any influence, which they appear to have, especially on
   the rising generation: so that they will soon be greatly the majority,
   if they are not so now, unless Christ interpose by his irresistible
   power.

   I take my leave of all these, knowing that if they persist in their
   unbelief, they will die in their sins, and perish in a greatly
   aggravated and everlasting destruction. But at the same time I have the
   peace and comfort, which no man can take from me, in the assurance
   that, though they are infinitely worse than lost to themselves, they
   are not lost to Christ and his church. For this their infidelity, a
   peculiar kind of aggravated wrath, and all the consequent evil which is
   coming upon them, will turn to the praise of the Redeemer forever, and
   he will be more honoured, and the redeemed more happy, than if such
   infidels had not existed.

   Still a more affecting and dreadful sight, if possible, opens to my
   view. There is in the Protestant world, and among us, an innumerable
   host of people, who, though they do not profess to disbelieve the
   gospel, yet do not obey it, but live in opposition to it, and in a
   constant, allowed disobedience to Christ, and that not only by refusing
   to do what he has commanded, but by greedily practising what he has
   forbidden. It would take many pages to enumerate half of the open vices
   which are practised by Protestants, notwithstanding all the restraints
   of civil government. These vices abound among those in high stations,
   and in the low, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, old and young.
   From all these I take my sorrowful departure, knowing that, unless they
   repent, the time is corning when Christ will say to them, "Depart from
   me, ye workers of iniquity. Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting
   punishment." But, in all this sorrow, I am rejoicing, that Christ will
   cleanse the world from this wickedness, and when the wicked are turned
   into hell, he will fill it with holy inhabitants; and he will be more
   glorified, and the church more happy, than could be if all this
   wickedness had not taken place.

   Another numerous class of Protestants now come into view, who are too
   ignorant or erroneous to be saved. Many of these are included in the
   class last mentioned, but not all; for whether their lives be vicious,
   or what may be called moral, if they be ignorant of the gospel and the
   truths of which it consists, or if they do not believe these truths,
   but deny and reject them, they cannot be saved by it.

   I am sensible that I am now exposing myself to the indignation and
   contempt of an increasing number, whose sentiments on this head are
   what they call catholic and liberal. These will say to me, What right
   have you to make a creed for us, or any other man, and insist that all
   must believe and cordially embrace the doctrines you hold, in order to
   be saved? We believe it is of no great importance what a man's creed
   is, or whether he has any, if he be honest and sincere in what he does,
   and worships God, and lives a good moral life.

   To these I have to say, Ye are some of those whom I mean to include in
   the above description. You assert that the doctrines or truths revealed
   in the gospel, if there be any, are of no importance, so that he who
   does not believe them, and whatever he believes, and he who is totally
   ignorant of the truth, may be saved, as well as if they understood and
   believed the truth. You are yourselves totally ignorant of the gospel,
   and appear to be real enemies to it; for if what you assert were true,
   the gospel is worth nothing, and men may be saved without as well as by
   it.

   He only who believes the gospel, as preached by the inspired apostles,
   can be saved. If we exclude the system of truth contained in the
   gospel, we exclude the gospel; for it wholly consists in a revelation
   of these truths. Some of them are these: That all mankind are sinners,
   in a state of total moral depravity by nature, in consequence of the
   apostasy of their first parents, and under the curse of the righteous
   law of God: that Jesus Christ came into the world to save such lost
   sinners, by making a full atonement for their sins, by suffering in
   their stead, and meriting eternal life for them by his obedience, and
   power by the Holy Spirit to renew and sanctify them: all which is
   infinitely too great for any mere creature to do; therefore he must be
   a Divine Person, really God with us, manifested in the human nature:
   that, in order to be saved, men must be renewed unto holiness by the
   Spirit of God, in which he is the first mover, by regenerating them; of
   which none have any desert or claim. Therefore he has mercy on whom he
   will, and whom he will he hardeneth; which naturally and even
   necessarily introduces the doctrine of the divine decrees with respect
   to man and his salvation, and consequently respecting every thing else;
   and of election, and the certain perseverance of believers to complete
   salvation: that men obtain pardon and justification by their union to
   Christ, by their believing on and trusting in him for this, and all
   they want, which they receive, not out of respect to any goodness,
   worth or desert in themselves, or any thing they do; that they are
   wholly dependent on God, for every degree of right disposition and will
   to do what God requires, and not in the least on themselves; and this
   absolute dependence on God extends to every thing in which they have
   any concern: that their salvation is therefore altogether, from
   beginning to end, the effect of undeserved, free, sovereign grace: that
   true holiness consists not at all in selfish affections, but in
   disinterested love to God and man: that they who do not believe this
   gospel, and are not partakers of this holiness, and persevere in this
   way, will perish in everlasting destruction.

   These doctrines are all contained in the gospel; and, with others not
   mentioned, which are implied in these, compose a system of truth, which
   is really the gospel, and is often in the scripture called The Truth;
   to which Christ came to bear witness; which men must come to the
   knowledge of, in order to be saved; which all true Christians are
   represented as cordially embracing and walking in, as the bond of their
   union and love to each other. They therefore who do not receive this
   truth, and love it, but in their hearts hate and oppose it, do not
   believe the gospel, are not friends to it, and cannot be saved.

   This is evidently true of the Arians and Socinians, who deny the
   divinity of Christ, and consequently the need of any proper atonement
   for sin, and oppose many other doctrines of the gospel, in which they
   agree with those called Arminians. These latter deny the depravity of
   man by the sin of Adam, or that he is totally depraved, and that they
   stand in any need to be regenerated by the irresistible influence of
   the Spirit of God, in order to love God, and do those good works by
   which they may please God and be saved. They are of consequence enemies
   to the doctrine of the decrees of God, as they respect the agency of
   man, in the concerns of his salvation, as being, with the other
   doctrines which they deny, contrary to the natural selfishness, pride
   and imagined independence of man. There are others who hold a mixture
   of inconsistent doctrines, and do not professedly join with Arminians,
   but evidently symbolize with them in many respects, and so as to
   exclude the pure, consistent and essential doctrines of the gospel.

   Some there are, who have been properly called Antinomians, who hold
   that Christ has so abolished the moral law, that Christians are not
   under obligation to obey it. And there are many others who are real
   Antinomians, who deny that any man can or ought to love the moral law,
   or God who made it, so long as he is under the curse of this law, and
   considers himself so, and has no hope of being delivered from it; but
   he must have some discovery that God is merciful to sinners, and that
   there is salvation for them by Christ, before he can love God or his
   law. And many, perhaps the most of this class, hold that no man can
   love God or the Redeemer, until he sees and believes, on good ground,
   that God loves him, and designs to save him; that Christ died for him
   in particular, and will save him. The love, and all the religion, for
   which all these plead, is altogether selfish, and has not a spark of
   real Christianity in it, but is directly contrary to it. Jesus Christ
   has declared it to be so: [Matth. v. 43, to the end of the chapter.] He
   says that the love to others which is grounded on their love to us is a
   selfish, wicked love, which men of the worst character do exercise;
   that Christian love is of a different and contrary nature, and so
   disinterested that it will extend to its worst enemies.

   There are many, who, though they do not expressly avow this selfish
   doctrine, by which all religion is bottomed on self love, but discard
   it, yet describe the religious views and exercises of Christians as
   consisting very much or altogether in selfishness, and urge the choice
   and practice of religion wholly from selfish motives. And if it be
   urged that true religion will lead Christians to those disinterested
   affections, and that conduct, of which Christ has set us an example,
   they cannot understand, but rather oppose it.

   There is another class of people called Universalists, who hold that
   all men will be finally saved. There has been for a few years past a
   considerable increase of those who profess to embrace this sentiment.
   Of these some are Arminians, others are Antinomians, and some
   enthusiasts. Few or none of them appear to understand and believe the
   pure, consistent doctrines of the gospel. They do not of late appear to
   increase who openly espouse this doctrine, and yet adhere to the Bible;
   and most of these soon lose their zeal in their cause. And their belief
   appears to have its natural effect on them, and leads them to live a
   careless, irreligious life; and numbers by degrees give up the Bible,
   and sink into infidelity. There is reason to believe that there are
   many who do not profess to embrace this doctrine, to whom it is so
   pleasing, that they wish and hope it to be true; and it has great
   influence upon them, and leads them to a careless neglect of and
   concern about religion, and of strict morality, and so hardens their
   hearts, that they are deaf to all admonitions, and will rather give up
   the Bible, and turn infidels, than admit that any will be miserable
   forever.

   All these, even those whose outward conduct is not immoral, and who
   appear religious, who yet cordially embrace and are at heart pleased
   with the errors which have been now mentioned, and whose religious
   exercises are grounded upon and conformable to them, are strangers to
   true religion, and in the way to destruction: and all these false
   doctrines and notions of religion, and all the practical religion that
   is built upon them, will be consumed by Christ with the Spirit of his
   mouth, and destroyed with the brightness of his coming. Of these
   therefore I must now take my leave, without the least disposition to
   flatter them, or hope of their prosperity in the way they are going;
   and with a pleasing certainty that all their errors and false religion
   shall be utterly abolished by Christ, and that he will be praised and
   honoured by all these errors and this opposition to him, however wide
   may be their spread, and though they may continue yet a considerable
   time, even to the end determined.

   I must now turn to the public professors of religion, the members of
   the Christian churches, of various different denominations, among
   Protestants.

   The pastors of churches, or the clergy of every degree and character,
   come first into view. It is doubtless true that the clergy are the
   leaders and principal instruments in all the moral good and evil which
   takes place in Christendom. All of the clergy in the Protestant world,
   who must be classed with those before described, by the erroneous
   doctrines they hold, or not preaching any scheme of doctrines, but who
   really leave out all the essential truths of the gospel, and confine
   themselves to what may be called spurious heathen morality, and all of
   immoral lives, whatever doctrines they preach, are of course excluded
   from the number of truly Christian ministers. Jesus Christ has fixed
   their doom. "Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
   prophesied in thy name? &c. And then will I profess unto them, I never
   knew you: Depart from me, ye that work iniquity." To these I cannot
   say, "God speed," when I take my leave of them, lest I be a partaker of
   their evil deeds.

   But I must be allowed to sift the clergy more closely; especially those
   of the United States of America, who are not excluded by the foregoing.
   A great body of ministers in these states are professed Calvinists,
   differing however in some points, and are generally irreproachable in
   their moral conduct. But they are asked seriously to consider whether
   they have good evidence that they have been born again, agreeably to
   the scripture account of that great change, and find themselves real
   friends to Christ and his cause, expressed in all proper ways.

   It is to be feared that many not having ever passed this change is the
   reason why they bring forth no more good fruit, and so much which is
   more like bad than good; in that they do not appear to encourage
   experimental religion, or preach upon it clearly or much, if at any
   time. And though they would be thought to be Calvinists, they appear to
   dislike, and never preach, some of the most important doctrines of
   Calvinism; such as, the total depravity of man; God's first moving, and
   sovereign grace, in the regeneration and conversion of sinners; and the
   doctrine of the decrees of God, taken in the only proper, strict and
   extensive sense; that he has declared whatsoever comes to pass. They
   ignorantly say, It would be better to say, God foreknew whatsoever
   comes to pass. They choose to call themselves moderate Calvinists; but
   might as well, and perhaps more properly, be called moderate Arminians.
   But I should be willing to lay all these names aside, as many appear to
   wish, were it not the shortest and most convenient way to denote the
   general scheme of doctrines which different persons embrace. This is
   agreeable to the practice of the Christian church in all the ages of
   it, whether more corrupt, or more pure. And no inconvenience has
   attended it, that I know of, which would not attend any other method.
   All of this class I must leave, with the fears concerning them,
   expressed above. And while I fall under their resentment and censure,
   as narrow and bigoted in my sentiments, and very censorious, I
   cheerfully leave the matter to the day when the Lord will bring to
   light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of
   the heart.

   But I return to those who embrace the doctrines of the reformation, of
   Calvin, and the chief and leading doctrines contained in the
   Westminster confession of faith, as being agreeable to the holy
   scriptures, and who give satisfactory evidence that they are the
   subjects of divine, regenerating grace, and are friends to Christ, and
   heartily engaged in his cause. I embrace you with cordial, benevolent
   affection, wishing you success in your work, and that you may be
   faithful unto death. It is to be wished you would give yourselves
   wholly to the work of the ministry, and that you were all students,
   constantly labouring to make advances in the knowledge of divinity, by
   reading, meditation, and conversing with those who are pursuing the
   same study of the scripture. We live in evil times, when Christianity,
   and especially true religion in principle and practice, is greatly
   opposed, and fast decaying in general, as if it would soon all be gone;
   and we have reason to believe these evil times will grow much worse.
   But this is so far from being a reason for sitting still and unactive,
   that it ought to be a motive to great and constant exertion to promote
   the cause of Christ, and oppose the flood of error and iniquity, which
   is coming in with a mighty, rapid stream. The cause of Christ will not
   be lost. His truth is great, and will prevail. Good is to be done now,
   and some sinners must be converted; and blessed is the man who has the
   greatest hand in this work. We are commanded to pray to the Lord of the
   harvest to send forth more labourers into his harvest. And we have
   assurance that our prayers will be answered, in his own way and time.
   He will fill the church and the world with ministers, furnished with
   such abilities, fortitude, diligence, zeal, knowledge and true wisdom,
   as to exceed any of us, beyond, far beyond our present conception. In
   this view, I overlook the present dark scene, and take a cheerful
   farewell of you and of the world.

   Having taken my leave of the clergy and pastors of churches among
   Protestants, I must not pass over the private members of these
   churches, in very different worldly circumstances and stations, and of
   various denominations. When all of this class, who are either ignorant
   of the essential doctrines of the gospel, or deny and oppose them, and
   imbibe contrary errors, as most agreeable to their hearts; and all
   those who take the name of Christians, but do not depart from iniquity,
   and lead vicious lives; also all mere formal professors, who do not
   live up to their profession, and bring forth good fruit, but in their
   general conversation and conduct mix with the men of the world, and
   live more conformable to them than like real Christians; finally, all
   those who appear strangers to experimental religion, or any thing like
   being born again; when all these are excluded and set aside, as not the
   proper objects of Christian charity, how comparatively small will be
   the number of the remnant who are left! And yet it is probable that
   among these, some, if not many, are, under a fair appearance, but mere
   hypocrites! The happy number of true Christians cannot be certainly
   known by any man, and some of them are not known by themselves to be
   real Christians; but the Lord knows who are his, and will own and take
   care of them.

   They are all united in believing and loving the truth as it is in
   Jesus, and have all drank into the same Spirit, under whatever form
   they worship, and whatever denomination they have taken. The
   distinctions by which the various denominations of Christians are now
   divided will doubtless vanish, when a greater degree of holiness and
   light shall take place, and prejudices by education or any other means
   shall be removed; and Christians will be united and of one mind in
   those things about which they are now divided, and their creed, in
   which they agree, as to substance, now, will remain the great bond of
   union. They who understand and believe that the wrath of man shall
   praise God, and that the remainder of wrath he will restrain, as all
   true Christians do, must, to be consistent, believe the doctrines
   preached and written by that great reformer John Calvin, and
   consequently the above mentioned confession of faith, in the substance
   of it; and therefore must be agreed in the chief articles of their
   creed; for all this is really contained in this passage of scripture;
   of which every unprejudiced, candid person must be convinced, if he
   will carefully attend to the words, and to the explanation that has
   been given of them.

   To you I address myself with peculiar pleasure. You live in a time
   pointed out in scripture prophecy as peculiarly evil; and present
   evils, which have lately increased, both moral and natural, doubtless
   will yet make a rapid progress, till they shall rise to a height which
   is beyond your present conception; and you have no reason to expect to
   live to see the end of them. Yet these words of the text, and the
   abundant promises made to the church, and to every true believer, are a
   sufficient ground of constant support and consolation to all real
   Christians. It is a ground of support and comfort to reflect and know
   that but a small part of the whole time of the trouble of the church
   yet remains to fill up the measure of her suffering, though the last
   conflict may be most severe. I believe we have not yet attained any
   light from scripture, from which we can be sure that Christians will
   not suffer persecution, and that a more trying and severe one than any
   that has yet taken place, before the millennium comes on. But this will
   not be, unless it be necessary for the good of the church, and to
   introduce the time of her prosperity in the best manner; and all this
   wrath of man, be it more or less, of longer or shorter duration, shall
   praise the Redeemer.

   The church will live and prosper, and will come forth from the furnace
   of affliction as gold purified seven times. "And the redeemed of the
   Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon
   their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing
   shall flee away." And why may not Christians begin their song now?
   Though you do not see the glorious Redeemer, yet, believing, you love
   him who orders all things perfectly well, takes the best care of the
   church, and of every one who trusts in him, and will glorify himself by
   all things to the highest degree. Well may you rejoice with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory; while you watch and keep your garments,
   striving together for the faith of the gospel, and in nothing terrified
   by your adversaries. With joy I now bid you a hearty, though I hope not
   a long farewell.

   But New-England, the place of my nativity, demands my more particular
   attention. Aside from my partiality in favour of this part of the
   world, I believe that all men of observation and judgment in this
   matter, who are acquainted with the Protestant world in general, and
   with the religious state of New-England, from the first settlement of
   it, will grant there has been the appearance of more true religion in
   principle, profession and practice, and a more regular, moral conduct
   among all orders and ages of persons, in this part of America, than in
   any other part of the Christian world of equal extent. Boston, the
   metropolis of New-England, has been, till within less than fifty years
   past, a place of more religious order in the observation of the sabbath
   and other religious duties, a better education of children, and of a
   more decent, sober, moral conduct of the inhabitants in general, than
   of any other equally or more populous city or town on the face of the
   earth. And the people in general in New-England were disposed to pay
   respect to religion, to maintain family religion and worship. The
   sabbath and public worship were regarded and attended upon, by the
   inhabitants in general. The churches were considerably large, and a
   degree of discipline kept up. Children were under government,
   instructed and catechised. Gross, open vices were in a great degree
   restrained. Leading men in public stations were in general exemplary,
   and the bigger part of people were intelligent in things of morality
   and religion, and of a good behaviour.

   But, alas! "How is the gold become dim! How is the most fine gold
   changed!" Of late years a great and rapid degeneracy has taken place,
   both in the doctrines and duties of religion. Family worship, and a
   proper government and religious education of children, are generally
   neglected. Error and ignorance in religious concerns, and vice and
   immorality in conduct, are greatly increasing. Infidelity, Deism, and
   Atheism are spreading as an irresistible torrent, and many, if not
   most, of the youth and rising generation are growing up ready to imbibe
   error and infidelity. If these shall have their natural course, unless
   divine influence interpose, and put a stop to them, New-England will
   soon become as famous for irreligion, infidelity, atheism, immorality
   and heathenism, as it has been for the contrary; and Christianity will
   be wholly excluded and forgotten. It is true that all Christian
   ministers, and others in public and private stations, who are friends
   to the cause of Christ, ought to hope, pray and strive against this
   evil, and exert themselves to the utmost in all proper ways in
   opposition to the cause of sin, Satan and evil men; and be ready to die
   in the cause of truth and religion. In the pleasing hope of this, I
   embrace you all, whether personally acquainted with you or not, with
   the most cordial affection and benevolent farewell. At the same time I
   take my leave of New-England, with the painful fear and prospect of the
   evils which have been mentioned, flying to my text and the truths
   contained in it for support and comfort.

   Rhode-Island, particularly Newport the capital, in which I have lived
   near thirty of the last years of my life, now demands my special
   attention.

   This town has been long noted for the many different religious sects
   and denominations into which the inhabitants are divided, while the
   body of the people have been considered, I believe justly, to have very
   little true religion, if any; and they have appeared more dissolute,
   vicious, erroneous and ignorant than people in general are in other
   parts of New-England. And there has been no general revival of
   religion, or reformation, to this day; and the moral state and
   character of the inhabitants in general has not become better, bat the
   contrary. The extraordinary and general revival of religion in
   New-England and many other places, about sixty years ago, did not reach
   Newport in any considerable degree. While the heavenly dew fell
   copiously on other places, this town received but a few scattering
   drops, and remained almost wholly dry. There are a great number of
   families in this place who have no appearance of any sort of religion
   in their houses, and who never attend on any public worship; and there
   are many individuals of this character in other families; and many
   others, who, though they attend public worship sometimes, yet not
   constantly nor often. All these doubtless include the greatest number
   of the whole inhabitants; and a great part of them are so inattentive
   to religion, and so ignorant, that they have really no religions
   principles: others have imbibed, and are strongly fixed in, religious
   maxims and notions, as contrary to the Bible as darkness is to the
   light. Of those who constantly attend public worship, including the
   professors of religion, very few of them maintain any family worship or
   religion, and by far the greater part are so immoral in their conduct,
   or ignorant or erroneous in their notions of religion, as to fall
   vastly short of the scripture character of true Christians.

   There have been a number of real and excellent Christians in this town,
   of different denominations, who are now in heaven; and doubtless there
   are some yet among us, but there is reason to conclude that the number
   of such is greatly lessened, and that there are now but very few. Of
   you I take my affectionate leave, wishing you may increase in number,
   and shine, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, as lights
   in the world.

   The slave trade, and the slavery of the Africans in which this town has
   had a greater hand than any other town in New-England, must not be
   passed over unmentioned here. This inhuman trade has been the first and
   chief spring of all the trade and business by which this town has risen
   and flourished: which has therefore been built up, in a great measure,
   by the blood and unrighteous sufferings of the poor Africans. And this
   trade is yet carried on here, in the face of all the light and matter
   of conviction of the unrighteousness and aggravated iniquity of it,
   which has of late years been offered, and against the express laws of
   God and man. And there is no evidence that the citizens in general have
   a proper sense of the evil of this business, of the guilt which has
   been contracted by it, and of the displeasure of God for it, or that
   they have a just abhorrence of it; but there is much evidence of the
   contrary, and that there is little or no true repentance of it.

   In this dark, unpleasant and melancholy view of the state and character
   of the body of the inhabitants of this town, I must take my leave, with
   a painful prospect of the evil which is coming upon them and their
   posterity; which they would not believe, were they told. To most of
   them I cannot speak, and if I could, and they should know what I think
   and say of them, it would only serve to excite the resentment and
   indignation of the most.

   But there is a bright side, to which the Christian may look for support
   and comfort, in the midst of all this dark and evil state of things,
   which cannot be too often brought into view. All this sin and wrath of
   man, and the evils which attend and follow it, will praise Christ, and
   turn to the greatest good of his kingdom. And all the wicked shall be
   shaken from the earth, and from this island too; and it shall yet be
   full of meek, humble, and holy inhabitants, who shall praise the Lord,
   and delight themselves in the abundance of peace and happiness. Amen.
   Hallelujah: for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.

   But I must now come nearer home, and, not without sensible and
   affectionate emotions, take my farewell of the church and congregation
   in this town with whom I have lived, ministering to them most of the
   time for above thirty years.

   When I first came among you the church was not small, and increased in
   number; and the congregation appeared to flourish. Above a hundred
   young persons used to repair to my house at appointed times for
   religious instruction. Bat when the war with the British came on, we
   were, for a time, broken up, and many of us scattered into the country,
   a number of whom never returned again. In this time, our parsonage
   house was destroyed, the bell of the meeting-house was taken away, and
   the inside of the house was so defaced and destroyed by the enemy, that
   public worship could not be attended in it; and those who staid in the
   town during the residence of the British here, and those who went out
   and returned again, suffered losses in their worldly interest. By these
   events, and by the deaths that have taken place, both on the land, and
   of the men who have used the sea, we are become few in number, and in a
   degree poor in worldly circumstances. Most of the church and
   congregation which were on the stage when I first came here are gone to
   the grave. But the greatest calamity of all is, the good people who
   have deceased have none, or very few, to succeed them and fill up their
   places, and have left us in a great and awful degree destitute of the
   power and practice of true religion. In these dark and disagreeable
   circumstances, I now take my leave of you; yet with a hope, though a
   faint one, that after I am gone God will build you up, and grant you
   and your children greater spiritual blessings than you have had while I
   have been with you.

   I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God, so far
   as I have understood what it was. In doing this I am sensible I have
   preached and published doctrines which are very offensive and odious to
   many, though I hope to but few if any of you. I have opposed evil
   practices, by which I have incurred the displeasure and resentment of
   many; and have taught and inculcated duties, and an experimental,
   practical religion, which consists most essentially in self-denial, as
   the only way to heaven, which are disagreeable to many, and not
   believed to be true. Some of the doctrines which I have preached and
   published have been opposed from the press and the pulpit, and more
   privately, and have not been understood, and represented as horrible
   and mischievous, tending to destroy all true religion, &c. But all this
   has no impression on me, to excite the least doubt of the truth of the
   doctrines so opposed, or to incline me to cease to assert and vindicate
   them. I have such clear and full conviction, and unshaken confidence,
   that the doctrines which I have for a long course of years preached and
   maintained, are the truths contained in the Bible, that I stand as a
   brazen wall, unhurt, and not moved by all the shafts of opposition and
   reproach which have been levelled at me, and the system of truth and
   religion which I have espoused; being assured that it will stand
   forever; and certain beyond a doubt, from scripture, reason and
   experience, that a cordial belief and love of these truths, with
   religious exercises and conduct agreeable to them, is connected with
   salvation, and is a sufficient ground of support and comfort under the
   greatest trials, and in the nearest view of death and eternity. On this
   foundation I cheerfully rest my eternal interest, which indeed is
   infinite, and invite all to do the same.

   To you therefore, my dear people, both old and young, as a dying man,
   and in the view of a judgment and eternity to come, I recommend the
   religion which I have endeavoured to preach and inculcate among you for
   a number of years, and to exemplify in practice, both publicly, more
   privately and in secret. Being assured that he only is safe and happy
   who is a real Christian, I recommend Christ to you with my dying breath
   as the only refuge for sinners: for "He that believeth, and is
   baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."

   Finally, I take my leave of all my acquaintance, friends, and
   relatives, whether nearer or farther off, wishing they may all partake
   of the saving blessings of the gospel: and if I have any enemies, I
   forgive them, and wish to them the same blessings. To my kind
   benefactors, I wish the abundant rewards promised in the word of God to
   the charitable and bountiful, even to all who give so much as a cup of
   cold water to any of the professed disciples of Christ, because they
   belong to Him. To my particular Christian friends, in whom has been my
   chief delight, and who, I have often said, are my greatest treasure on
   earth, I leave my best wishes, with a fond and animating hope of living
   forever with you in the most intimate, perfect, and uninterrupted
   friendship. Amen.

FINIS.
