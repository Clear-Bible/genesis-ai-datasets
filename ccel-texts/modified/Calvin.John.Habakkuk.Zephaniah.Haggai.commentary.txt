   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.

   The present Volume, though it contains the Works of These Prophets, is
   yet considerably smaller in size than the preceding Volumes; but the
   last will more than compensate for this deficiency.

   The two first Prophets, Habakkuk and Zephaniah, lived before the
   Captivity; and the other, Haggai began his prophetic office about
   sixteen years after the return of the great body of the people from
   Babylon by the permission given them by King Cyrus.

   It is commonly thought that Habbakuk prophesied after Zephaniah, though
   placed before him in our Bibles. The reign of Jehoiakin is assigned as
   his age, about 608 years before Christ, while Zephaniah performed his
   office in the reign of Josiah, about 30 years earlier. Like the other
   prophets he is mainly engaged in reproving the extreme wickedness of
   the people, on account of which he denounces on them the judgments of
   God, while he gives occasional intimations of a better state of things,
   and affords some glimpses of the blessings of the gospel.

   In the first Chapter he begins with a complaint as to the oppression
   which he witnessed, foretells the dreadful invasion of the Chaldeans,
   describes the severity which would be exercised by them, and appeals to
   God on the subject. In the second he waits for an answer, receives it,
   and predicts the downfal of the Chaldeans, and refers to blessings in
   reserve for God's people. The third contains what is called the "Prayer
   of Habakkuk," an ode of a singular character, in which he briefly
   describes, for the encouragement of the faithful, the past
   interpositions of God on behalf of his people, and concludes with
   expressing a full and joyful confidence in God, notwithstanding' the
   evils which were coming on the nation.

   "The style of Habakkuk," Says Bishop Lowth, "is poetical, especially in
   his Ode, which may justly be deemed one of the most complete of its
   kind." [1] And in describing the character of this ode he says--"The
   Prophet indeed embellishes the whole of this poem with a magnificence
   equal to its commencement, selecting from so great an abundance of
   wonderful events the grandest, and setting them forth in the most
   splendid dress, by images and figures, and the most elevated diction;
   the high sublimity of which he augments and enhances by the elegance of
   a remarkable conclusion: so that hardly any thing of this kind would be
   more beautiful or more perfect than this poem, were it not for one or
   two spots of obscurity which are to be found in it, occasioned, as it
   seems, by its ancientness." [2]

   Zephaniah was in part contemporary with Jeremiah, that is, during the
   former portion of the reign of Josiah. He foretells the Fall Of
   Nineveh, (Zephaniah 2:13,) and mentions "the remnant of Baal,"
   (Zephaniah 1:4,) two things which prove that he prophesied during the
   former half of that king's reign; for Nineveh was destroyed about the
   sixteenth year of his reign, and it was after that time that the
   worship of Baal was demolished by that king.

   The sins of The Jews and their approaching judgments occupy the first
   Chapter. The second contains an exhortation to Repentance, encouraged
   by a promise of protection during the evils that God would bring on
   neighboring nations. In the third the Prophet particularizes the sins
   of Jerusalem, announces its punishment, and then refers to the future
   blessings which God would freely confer on His Church.

   The style of Zephaniah has been represented as being in some parts
   prosaic; and Lowth says that "he seems to possess nothing remarkable or
   superior in the arrangement of his matter or in the elegance of his
   diction." [3] But it is Henderson's opinion that "many of the censures
   that have been passed on his language are either without foundation or
   much exaggerated." He appears to be as poetic in his ideas as most of
   the Prophets, and in the manner in which he arranges them, though he
   deals not much in parallelisms, which constitute a prominent feature in
   Hebrew poetry.

   The matters handled by the Prophet are said by Marckius to be "most
   worthy of God, whether we regard His serious reproofs or His severe
   threatenings, or His kind warnings, or His gracious promises, which
   especially appertain to the dispensation of the New Testament. In all
   these particulars he not only agrees with the other prophets, but also
   adopts their expressions." [4] He then gives the following examples:--

   Zephaniah 1:6 compared with Jeremiah 15:6

   Zephaniah 1:15 compared with Joel 2:1, 2

   Zephaniah 1:18 compared with Ezekiel 7:19, and Jeremiah 4:27

   Zephaniah 2:8, 9 compared with Jeremiah 48:2, and Ezekiel 25:1

   Zephaniah 3:3, 4 compared with Ezekiel 22:26, 27, 28, etc.

   It does not appear at what time Haggai returned from exile, though
   probably at the first return of the Jews under Zerubbabel, before
   Christ 536. But he did not commence his prophetic office till about
   sixteen years after; and he delivered what his Book contains in the
   space of three months. His messages, which are five, [5] are very
   short; and hence some have concluded that they are but summaries of
   what he had delivered.

   Much of this Book is historical, interspersed with what is conveyed in
   a poetic style. The Prophet, in the first Chapter, remonstrates with
   the people, who were very attentive to their own private concerns, but
   neglected to build the Lord's Temple; he refers to the judgments with
   which they had been visited on this account, encourages them to
   undertake the work, and promises them the favor of God; and then he
   tells us of his success. In the second Chapter he removes an apparent
   ground of discouragement, the temple then in building being not so
   splendid as the former, and promises an additional glory to it,
   evidently referring to the Gospel times. He then warns them against
   relaxing in their work and thinking it enough merely to offer
   sacrifices, assures them of God's blessing, and concludes with a
   special promise to Zerubbabel.

   What Lowth says of this Prophet's style, that "it is altogether
   prosaic," is not strictly true; for there are some parts highly
   poetical. See Haggai 1:6, and from 8 to 11 inclusive. "The style of
   Haggai," observes Henderson, "is not distinguished by any peculiar
   excellence; yet he is not destitute of pathos and vehemence, when
   reproving his countrymen for their negligence, exhorting them to the
   performance of duty."

   Though in some instances our Commentator may not give the precise
   import of a passage, yet he never advances but what is consistent with
   Divine Truth, and always useful and practical, and often what betokens
   a profound acquaintance with the operations of the human mind under the
   various trials and temptations which we meet with in this life; so that
   the observations made are ever interesting and instructive. Calvin
   never deduces from a passage what is in itself erroneous or unsound,
   though in all cases he may not deduce what the text may legitimately
   warrant. There is, therefore, nothing dangerous in what he advances,
   though it. may not be included in the passage explained. But for the
   most part his application of doctrine is what may be fully justified,
   and is often very striking, and calculated to instruct and edify.

   Some may think that our Author does not always give that full range of
   meaning to the promises and predictions which he explains. A reason for
   this may probably be found in the fact, that most of the Commentators
   who had preceded him had indulged in very great extravagancies on the
   subject; and a reaction generally drives men to an opposite extreme.
   But it is very seldom that Calvin can be justly charged with a fault of
   this kind; for, entertaining the profoundest veneration for the Word of
   God, he strictly followed what he conceived the words imported, and
   what he apprehended to be the general drift of a passage. Possibly, in
   the estimation of those who possess a very vivid imagination, he may be
   thought to have kept too closely to what the text and the context
   require; but in explaining the Divine Oracles, nothing is more to be
   avoided than to let loose the imagination, and nothing is more
   necessary than to possess a sound judgment, and to exercise it in the
   fear of God, and with prayer for His guidance and direction.

   of John Calvin

   on the Prophet

   Habakkuk
     __________________________________________________________________

   Calvin's Preface to Habakkuk

   Now follows The Prophet Habakkuk; [6] but the time in which he
   discharged his office of a Teacher is not quite certain. The Hebrews,
   according to their usual manner, unhesitatingly assert that he
   prophesied under the king Manasseh; but this conjecture is not well
   founded. We are however led to think that this prophecy was announced
   when the contumacy of the people had become irreclaimable. It is indeed
   probable, from the complaint which we shall have presently to notice,
   that the people had previously given many proofs of irremediable
   wickedness. To me it appears evident that the Prophet was sent, when
   others had in vain endeavored to correct the wickedness of the people.
   But as he denounces an approaching judgement on the Chaldeans, he seems
   to have prophesied either under Manasseh or under the other kings
   before the time of Zedechiah; but we cannot fix the exact time. [7]

   The substance of the Book may be thus stated:--In the First chapter he
   complains of the rebellious obstinacy of the people, and deplores the
   corruptions which then prevailed; he then appears as the herald of God,
   and warns the Jews of their approaching ruin; he afterwards applies
   consolation, as God would punish the Chaldeans when their pride became
   intolerable. In the second chapter he exhorts the godly to patience by
   his own example, and speaks at large of the near ruin of Babylon; and
   in the third chapter, as we shall see, he turns to supplication and
   prayer.

   We shall now come to the words.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] Who Habakkuk was is uncertain. Some have concluded, from chapter
   3:19, that he was of the tribe of Levi; but the premises do not warrant
   the conclusion. "He was probably," says Adam Clarke, "of the tribe of
   Simeon, and a native of Beth-zacar." The grounds for this probability
   are not stated.--Ed.

   [7] Newcome's opinion is the following:--"It seems probable that
   Habakkuk lived after the taking of Nineveh, as he prophesies of the
   Chaldeans, and is silent on the subject of the Assyrians. We have also
   reason to conclude that he prophesied not long before the Jewish
   captivity. See chapter 1:5; 2:3; 3:2,6-19. He may therefore be placed
   in the reign of Jehoiakim, between the years 606 and 598 before
   Christ." Henderson agrees with this view. "Hunc librum canonicum esse
   constat,"--tum 1. quia in Bibliis Hebrais extat; tum 2. quia in N.T.
   allegatum, Acts 13:41; Romans 1:17; Galatians 3:11; Hebrews 10:38. It
   appears that this book is canonical, 1., because it is extant in
   Hebrew; 2., because it is quoted in the New Testament,"
   etc.--Tarnovius.

   Habakkuk 1:1

   1. The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

   1. Onus quod vidit Chabakuk Propheta.

   The greater part of interpreters refer this burden to the Chaldeans and
   the monarchy of Babylon; but of this view I do not approve, and a good
   reason compels me to dissent from their opinion: for as the Prophet
   addresses the Jews, and without any addition calls his prophecy a
   burden, there is no doubt but that he refers to them. Besides, their
   view seems wholly inconsistent, because the Prophet dreads the future
   devastation of the land, and complains to God for allowing His chosen
   and elect people to be so cruelly treated. What others think is more
   correct--that this burden belonged to the Jews.

   What the Prophet understood by the word ms', mesha, has been elsewhere
   stated. Habakkuk then reproves here his own nation, and shows that they
   had in vain disdainfully resisted all God's prophets, for they would at
   length find that their threatening would be accomplished. The burden,
   then, which the Prophet Habakkuk saw, was this--That God, after having
   exercised long forbearance towards the Jews, would at length be the
   punisher of their many sins. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 1:2, 3

   2. O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out
   unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!

   2. Quousque, Jehova, clamabo, et non exaudies? Vociferabor ad te ob
   violentiam, et non servabis?

   3. Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance?
   for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up
   strife and contention.

   3. Quare ostendis mihi iniquitatem, et moestiam aspicere facis? Et
   direptio et violentia in conspectu meo? et est qui litem et
   contentionem excitet.


   As I have already reminded you, interpreters think that the Prophet
   speaks here of future things, as though he had in his view the calamity
   which he afterwards mentions; but this is too strained a meaning; I
   therefore doubt not but that the Prophet expostulates here with God for
   so patiently indulging a reprobate people. For though the Prophets felt
   a real concern for the safety of the people, there is yet no doubt but
   that they burned with zeal for the glory of God; and when they saw that
   they had to contend with refractory men, they were then inflamed with a
   holy displeasure, and undertook the cause of God; and they implored His
   aid to bring a remedy when the state of things had become desperate. I
   therefore consider that the Prophet here solicits God to visit these
   many sins in which the people had hardened themselves. And hence we
   conclude that he had previously exercised his office of a teacher; for
   it would have been otherwise improper for him to begin his work with
   such a complaint and expostulation. He had then by experience found
   that the people were extremely perverse. When he saw that there was no
   hope of amendment, and that the state of things was becoming daily
   worse, burning with zeal for God, he gave full vent to his feelings.
   Before, then, he threatens the people with the future vengeance of God,
   he withdraws himself, as it were, from intercourse with men, and in
   private addresses God himself.

   We must bear this first in mind, that the Prophet relates here the
   secret colloquy he had with God: but it ought not to be ascribed to an
   unfeeling disposition, that in these words he wished to hasten God's
   vengeance against his own kindred; for it behaved the Prophet not only
   to be solicitous for the salvation of the people, but also to feel a
   concern for the glory of God, yea, to burn with a holy zeal. As, then,
   he had in vain labored for a length of time, I doubt not but that,
   being as it were far removed from the presence of all witnesses, he
   here asks God, how long he purposed thus to bear with the wickedness of
   the people. We now apprehend the design of the Prophet and the import
   of his words.

   But he says first, How long, Jehovah, shall I cry, and thou hearest
   not? How long shall I cry to thee for violence, that is, on account of
   violence, and thou savest not? We hence learn, that the Prophet had
   often prayed God to correct the people for their wickedness, or to
   contrive some means to prevent so much licentiousness in sinning. It is
   indeed probable that the Prophet had prayed as long as there was any
   hope; but when he saw that things were past recovery, he then prayed
   more earnestly that God would undertake the office of a judge, and
   chastise the people. For though the Prophet really condoled with those
   who perished, and was touched, as I have said, with a serious concern
   for their public safety, he yet preferred the glory of God: when,
   therefore, he saw that boldness in sin increased through impunity, and
   that the Jews in a manlier mocked God when they found that they could
   sin without being punished, he could not endure such unbridled
   wantonness. Besides, the Prophet may have spoken thus, not only as
   expressing his own feeling, but what he felt in common with all the
   godly; as though he had undertaken here a public duty, and utters a
   complaint common to all the faithful: for it is probable that all the
   godly, in so disordered a state of things, mourned alike. How long,
   then, shall I cry? How long, he says, shall I cry on account of
   violence? that is, When all things are in disorder, when there is now
   no regard for equity and justice, but men abandon themselves, as it
   were with loose reins, unto all kinds of wickedness, how long, Lord,
   wilt thou take no notice? But in these words the Prophet not only
   egresses his own feelings, but makes this kind of preface, that the
   Jews might better understand that the time of vengeance was come; for
   they were become not only altogether intolerable to God, but also to
   his servants. God indeed had suspended his judgement, though he had
   been often solicited to execute it by his Prophet. It hence appears,
   that their wickedness had made such advances that it would be no wonder
   if they were now severely chastised by the Lord; for they had by their
   sins not only provoked him against them, but also all the godly and the
   faithful.

   He afterwards adds, How long wilt thou show me iniquity, and make me to
   see trouble? Here the Prophet briefly relates the cause of his
   indignation,--that he could not, without great grief, yea, without
   anguish of mind, behold such evils prevailing among God's chosen
   people; for they who apply this to the Chaldeans, do so strainedly, and
   without any necessity, and they have not observed the reason which I
   have stated--that the Prophet does not here teach the Jews, but
   prepares them for a coming judgement, as they could not but see that
   they were justly condemned, since they were proved guilty by the cry
   and complaints made by all the godly.

   Now this passage teaches us, that all who really serve and love God,
   ought, according to the Prophet's example, to burn with holy
   indignation whenever they see wickedness reigning without restraint
   among men, and especially in the Church of God. There is indeed nothing
   which ought to cause us more grief than to see men raging with profane
   contempt for God, and no regard had for his law and for divine truth,
   and all order trodden under foot. When therefore such a confusion
   appears to us, we must feel roused, if we have in us any spark of
   religion. If it be objected, that the Prophet exceeded moderation, the
   obvious answer is this,--that though he freely pours forth his
   feelings, there was nothing wrong in this before God, at least nothing
   wrong is imputed to him: for wherefore do we pray, but that each of us
   may unburden his cares, his griefs, and anxieties, by pouring them into
   the bosom of God? Since, then, God allows us to deal so familiarly with
   him, nothing wrong ought to be ascribed to our prayers when we thus
   freely pour forth our feelings, provided the bridle of obedience keeps
   us always within due limits, as was the case with the Prophet; for it
   is certain that he was retained under the influence of real kindness.
   Jeremiah did indeed pray with unrestrained fervor (Jeremiah 15:10): but
   his case was different from that of our Prophet; for he proceeds not
   here to an excess, as Jeremiah did when he cursed the day of his birth,
   and when he expostulated with God for being made a man of contention.
   But our Prophet undertakes here the defense of justice; for he could
   not endure the law of God to be made a sport, and men to allow
   themselves every liberty in sinning.

   We now, then, see that the Prophet can be justly excused, though he
   expostulates here with God, for God does not condemn this freedom in
   our prayers; but, on the contrary, the end of praying is, that every
   one of us pour forth, as it is said in the Psalms, his heart before
   God. As, then, we communicate our cares and sorrows to God, it is no
   wonder that the Prophet, according to the manner of men, says, Why dost
   thou show me iniquity, and make me to see trouble? Trouble is to be
   taken here in an active sense, and the verb tvym, tabith, has a
   transitive meaning. [8] Some render it, Why dost thou look on trouble?
   as though the Prophet indignantly bore the connivance of God. But the
   context necessarily requires that this verb should be taken in a
   transitive sense. "Why dost thou show me iniquity?" and then, "and
   makest me to look on violence?" He says afterwards, in the third place,
   in my sight is violence. But I have said, that the word trouble is to
   be taken actively; for the prophet means not that he was worn out with
   weariness, but that wicked men were troublesome to the good and the
   innocent, as it is usually the case when a freedom in sinning prevails.

   And why, he says, are violence and plunder in my sight? and there is he
   who excites, etc.? The verb ns', nusha means not here to undertake, as
   some render it; but, on the contrary, to raise. Others render it, "Who
   supports," but this is frigid. Therefore the translation which I have
   stated is the most suitable--And why is there one who excites strife
   and contention?

   But the Prophet here accuses them only of sins against the second table
   of the law: he speaks not of the superstitions of people, and of the
   corrupted worship of God; but he briefly says, that they had no regard
   for what was just and right: for the stronger any one was, the more he
   distressed the helpless and the innocent. It was then for this reason
   that he mentioned iniquity, trouble, plunder, violence, contention,
   strife. In short, the Prophet here deplores, that there was now no
   equity and no brotherly kindness among the people, but that robberies,
   rapines, and tyrannical violence prevailed everywhere. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] Rather, a causative meaning; for so does Calvin take it; and Junius
   and Tremelius, Piscator, Grotius, and Newcome, agree with him: but
   Drusius, Marckius, Henderson, and others, consider it simply in the
   sense of seeing or beholding, and say with truth, that there is no
   other instance in which it has, though it be often found, as here, in
   Hiphil, a causative sense. The context, as Calvin says, seems certainly
   to favor this meaning; and we might suppose that Habakkuk used it in a
   sense different from others, were it not that he uses it at least twice
   in this very chapter, verses 5 and 13, simply in the sense of seeing or
   beholding. In these two verses there is no need of continuing the
   interrogatory form throughout, nor is this justified by the original. A
   strictly literal rendering, such as the following, would be the most
   appropriate: 2. How long, Jehovah, have I cried, and thou hearest not?
   I cry aloud to thee, "oppression," and thou savest not: 3. Why showest
   thou to me iniquity? Yea, wickedness is what thou seest; Even wasting
   and oppression are before me; Then there is strife, and contention
   arises. Some think that there is to be understood a preposition before
   [chmm], which I render "oppression," in the second line; but there is
   no need of it. The word means outrage, wrong forcibly done, violent
   injustice. [ml], wickedness, in the second line of the third verse, in
   its primary sense, is labor, toil; it means also what produces toil,
   mischief, wickedness. Henderson renders it misery; but it is not so
   suitable; for it must be something that corresponds with iniquity in
   the previous line. Wickedness is the word adopted by Newcome. [ryv],
   strife, is a verbal contention or quarrel; and [mdvz] contention, is a
   judicial contest, or a trial by law. Then in the next verse we see how
   unjustly this trial was conducted.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 1:4

   4. Therefore the law is slacked, and judgement doth never go forth: for
   the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgement
   proceedeth.

   4. Propterea dissolvitur (vel, debilitatur) lex, et non egredietur
   perpetuo judicium (vel, non egreditur:) quia impius circumdat justum,
   propterea impius circumdat justum, propterea egredietur judicium
   perversum.


   The Prophet confirms here what I have already said, and brings an
   excuse for his zeal; he proves that he was not without reason led to so
   great a warmth; for he saw that the law of God was trodden as it were
   under foot; he saw men so hardened in every kind of sin, that all
   religion and the fear of God had nearly been extinguished. Hence I have
   already said, that the Prophet was not here impelled by a carnal
   passion, as it often happens to us, when we defend ourselves from
   wrongs done to us; for when any one of us is injured, he immediately
   becomes incensed, while, at the same time, we suffer God's law to be a
   sport, His whole truth to be despised, and everything that is just to
   be violated. We are only tender on what concerns us individually, and
   in the meantime we easily forgive when God is wronged, and His truth
   despised. But the Prophet shows here that he was not made indignant
   through a private feeling, but because he could not bear the
   profanation of God's worship and the violation of His holy law.

   He therefore says, that the law was dissolved or weakened, as though he
   said that God's law had no longer any authority or regard. Let us hence
   learn to rouse up ourselves, for we are very frigid, when the ungodly
   openly despise and even mock God. As, then, we are too unconcerned in
   this respect, let us learn, by the Prophet's example, to stimulate
   ourselves. For even Paul also shows, in an indirect way, that there is
   just reason for indignation--Be ye angry,' he says, and sin not,'
   (Ephesians 4:26); that is, every one ought to regard his own sins, so
   as to become an enemy to himself; and he ought also to feel indignant
   whenever he sees God offended.

   This rule the Prophet now follows, Weakened, he says, is the law [9] We
   know that when a sinful custom prevails, there is but little authority
   in what is taught: nor are human laws only despised when men's audacity
   breaks through all restraints, but even the very law of God is esteemed
   as nothing; for they think that everything erroneously done, by the
   consent of all, is lawful. We now then see that the Prophet felt great
   anguish of mind, like holy Lot (Genesis 19:1-38.), when he saw every
   regard for God almost extinct in the land, and especially among the
   chosen people, whom God had above all others consecrated to himself.

   He then adds, judgement goes not forth perpetually. Absurdly do many
   regard this as having been said in the person of foolish men, who think
   that there is no such thing as divine providence, when things in the
   world are in a disordered state: but the Prophet simply says, that all
   justice was suppressed. We have nearly the very same complaint in
   Isaiah 59:4. He then says, that judgement did not go forth perpetually,
   because the ungodly thought that no account was to be given by them.
   When, therefore, any one dared to say a word against them, they
   immediately boiled with rage, and like wild beasts fiercely attacked
   him. All then were silent, and nearly made dumb, when the ungodly thus
   prevailed and gathered boldness from the daily practice of
   licentiousness. Hence, Go forth perpetually does not judgement;' that
   is, "O Lord, things are now past hope, and there appears to be no end
   to our evils, except thou comest soon and applies a remedy beyond what
   our flesh can conceive." For the wicked, he says, surround the
   righteous; that is, when there was any one who continued to retain some
   regard for religion and justice, immediately the wicked rose up against
   him on every side and surrounded him before and behind; so it happened,
   that no one dared to oppose the torrent, though frauds, rapines,
   outrages, cruelty, and even murders everywhere prevailed; if any
   righteous men still remained, they dared not come forth into the
   public, for the wicked beset them on all sides.

   He afterwards adds, Therefore perverted judgement goes forth. The
   Prophet now rises higher, that even the rulers themselves increased the
   rage for evils, and as it were supplied fuel to their wickedness, as
   they confounded all distinction between right and wrong: for the
   Prophet speaks not here of private wrongs which any one might have
   done, but he speaks of the very rulers, as though he said, "There might
   have been one remedy, the judges might have checked so great an
   audacity; but they themselves stretch out their hands to the wicked and
   help them." Hence the tribunals, which ought to have been sacred, were
   become as it were dens of thieves. The word mspht, meshiphith is taken
   properly in a good sense: Is not judgement then a desirable thing? Yes,
   but the Prophet says, that it was perverted. It was then by way of
   concession that judgement is mentioned; for he afterwards adds a word
   to it, by which he shows that the administration of the laws was evil
   and injurious: for when any one oppressed had recourse to the
   assistance of the laws, he was plundered. In short, the Prophet means,
   that all things in private and in public were corrupt among the people.
   It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [9] Calvin omits to notice "therefore," [l-kz], at the beginning of the
   verse. Henderson says, that the connection is with the second verse:
   but this can hardly be the case; and certainly what this verse contains
   is no reason for what is stated in the previous verse. [lkz], a similar
   proposition with this, when followed by [ky], as the case is here,
   refers sometimes to what follows and not to what precedes. See Psalm
   16:10,11; 78:21,22. The meaning of the verse will be elicited, as I can
   conceive, by the following version:-- On this account the law fails,
   And judgment goeth not forth to victory, --
   Because wickedness surrounds the righteous;
   Yea, on this account perverted judgment goeth forth. The expression,
   [l' lntsch], is rendered "never" in our version, and by Newcome; but it
   never means this: "not for ever, or not always," it is rendered in
   other places. See Psalm 9:19; 74:19. But [ntsch] means as a noun,
   superiority, excellency, strength, victory; and this, according to
   Parkhurst, is what it means here. It seems better to render [rs],
   wickedness, than wicked. It means injustice, the perversion of right,
   and by this the just man was surrounded or completely beset, so that he
   had no chance of having justice done to him.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 1:5

   5. Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously:
   for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though
   it be told you

   5. Videte in gentibus, et aspicite, et admiramini, admiramini; quia
   opus operans in diebus vestris, non credetis, quum narratum fuerit.


   The Prophet turns his discourse to the Jews, after having related the
   private colloquy, in which he expostulated with God for having so
   patiently borne with the obstinate wickedness of the nation. Being now
   as it were furnished with God's command, (as the case really was,) he
   performs the office of a herald, and proclaims an approaching
   destruction. He indeed adopts a preface, which ought to have awakened
   drowsy and careless minds. He says--look, see, be astonished, be
   astonished; these repetitions do not a little increase the alarm; he
   twice bids them to see, and he twice exhorts them to be astonished, or
   to wonder. He then briefly proclaims the judgement of God, which he
   afterwards more fully describes. We now, then, perceive the object of
   the Prophet, and the manner in which he proceeds with his subject.

   And he bids those among the nations to behold, as though he had said,
   that they were unworthy to be taught in the school of God; he therefore
   appointed other masters for them, even the Chaldeans, as we shall
   presently see. He might have said--look to God; but as the Prophet had
   so long spent his labor in vail and without profit while teaching them,
   he sets over them the Chaldeans as teachers. Behold, he says, ye
   teachers among the Gentiles. There is here indeed an implied contrast,
   as thought he said--"God has hitherto often recalled you to himself,
   and has offered himself to you, but ye have refused to look to him; now
   then, as he is wearied with exercising patience so long, he appoints
   for you other teachers; learn now from the Gentiles what ye leave
   hitherto refused to learn from the holy mouth of God himself".

   The Greek translators no doubt read vgvrym, for their version
   is--"Behold, ye despisers." [10] But in Hebrew there is no ambiguity as
   to the word.

   He afterwards adds--And wonder ye, wonder [11] By these words the
   prophets express how dreadful God's judgement would be, which would
   astonish the Jews themselves. Had they not been extremely refractory
   they might have quietly received instruction, for God would have
   addressed them by his prophets, as though they had been his own
   children. They might thus, with composed minds, have listened to God
   speaking to them; but the time was now come when they were to be filled
   with astonishment. We hence see that the Prophet meant this in a few
   words--that there would be a new mode of teaching, which would
   overwhelm the unwilling with astonishment, because they would not
   endure to be ruled in a gentle manner, when the Lord required nothing
   from them but to render themselves teachable.

   After having said that God's judgement would be dreadful, he adds that
   it was nigh at hand--a work, he says, will he work in your days, etc.
   They had already been often warned of that vengeance, but as they had
   for a long time disregarded it, they did ever remain sunk in their own
   self-delusions, like men who are wont to protract time and hunt on
   every side for some excuse for indulging themselves. So then when the
   people became hardened against all threatening, they thought that God
   would ever bear with them; hence the Prophet expressly declares, that
   the execution of that which they regarded as a fable was near at
   hand--He will work, he says, this work in your days

   He then subjoins--ye will not believe when it shall be told you; that
   is, God will execute such a punishment as will be incredible and exceed
   all belief. The Prophet no doubt alludes to the want of faith in the
   people, and indirectly reproves them, as though he said--"Ye have
   hitherto denied faith to God's word, but ye shall at length find that
   he has told the truth; and this ye shall find to your astonishment; for
   as his word has been counted by you incredible, so also incredible
   shall be his judgement." In short, the Prophet intimates this--that
   though the Prophets had been derided by the Jews, and despised as
   inventors of fables, yet nothing had been said by them which would not
   be fully accomplished. This reward then was to be paid to all the
   unbelieving; for God would in the most dreadful manner avenge their
   impiety, so that they should themselves be astonished and become an
   astonishment to others. We now perceive what the Prophet meant by
   saying that the Jews would not believe the work of God when told them,
   that is, the vengeance which he will presently describe.

   This passage is quoted by Paul, and is applied to the punishment then
   awaiting the Jews; for Paul, after having offered Christ to them, and
   seeing that many of them regarded the preaching of Gospel with scorn,
   added these words--"see," he said, "and be astonished, for God will
   work a work in your days which ye shall not believe." Paul at the same
   time made a suitable application of the Prophet's words; for as God had
   once threatened his people by his Prophet Habakkuk, so he was still
   like himself; and since had so severely vindicated the contempt of his
   law as to his ancient people, he could not surely bear with the impiety
   of that people whom he found to have acted so malignantly and so
   ungratefully, yea so wantonly and perversely, as to reject his grace;
   for this was the last remedy for the Jews. No wonder then that Paul set
   before them this vengeance, when the Jews of his time persisted through
   their unbelief to reject Christ. Now follows the explanation -
     __________________________________________________________________

   [10] This may perhaps be considered one of the very few instances in
   which the Septuagint seems to have retained the true reading without
   the countenance of a single MS.; for the word "despisers" is more
   suitable to the context. The very same word is found in the 13th verse
   of this chapter. The omission is very trifling, only of the letter [d],
   and Paul in quoting this passage, in Acts 13:41, retains this word,
   while in the other clauses he departs from the Septuagint, and comes
   nearer to the Hebrew text. Pocock thought that [vgvym] is a noun from
   the Arabic [vg'], which means to be unjust or injurious; and thus the
   Hebrew is made the same with the Septuagint, and St. Paul,
   kataphronetai, despisers--the insolent; but the former supposition
   seems the more probable--that the letter [d] has been omitted. Dathius
   renders the word "perfidi--perfidious," and Newcome
   "transgressors."--Ed.

   [11] This is the proper rendering, and not as in our version. It is not
   the usual mode in Hebrew to enhance the meaning by connecting two verbs
   together; but the two other verbs here are in the imperative mood, only
   the first is in Niphal and the other in Kal. Parkhurst very properly
   renders them, and be ye astonished, wonder, etc. The repetition, says
   Drusius, is for the sake of emphasis.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 1:6

   6. For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation,
   which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the
   dwellingplaces that are not theirs.

   6. Quia ecce ego excito Chaldaeos, gentem asperam, et praecipitem, quae
   incedet per latitudines terrae, ad possidendum tabernacula non sua.


   This verse is added by the Prophet as an explanation; for it was not
   enough to speak generally of God's work, without reminding them that
   their destruction by the Chaldeans was nigh at hand. He does not indeed
   in this verse explain what would be the character of that judgement
   which he had mentioned in the last verse Habakkuk 1:5; but he will do
   this in what follows. Now the Prophets differ from Moses in this
   respect, for they show, as it were by the finger, what he threatened
   generally, and they declare the special judgements of God; as it is
   indeed evident from the demonstrative adverb, "Behold." How necessary
   this was, we may gather from the perverseness of that people; for how
   distinctly soever the Prophets showed to them God's judgements, so that
   they saw them with their eyes, yet so great was their insensibility,
   that they despised denunciations so apparent. What, then, would have
   been done, if the Prophets had only said in general, God will not spare
   you!' This, then, is the reason why the Prophet, having spoken of God's
   terrible vengeance, now declares in express terms, that the Chaldeans
   were already armed by Him to execute His judgement. The rest we leave
   for tomorrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as our sins cry continually to heaven, each
   of us may turn to repentance, and by condemning ourselves of our own
   accord may anticipate thy judgement, and thus stir up ourselves to
   repentance, that being received into favor, we may find thee, whom we
   have provoked to take vengeance, to be indeed our Father: and may we be
   so preserved by thee in this world, that having at length put off all
   our vices, we may attain to that perfection of purity, to which thou
   invites us; and thus lead us more and more to thyself by thy Spirit,
   and separate us from the corruptions of this world, that we may glorify
   thee before men, and be at last made partakers of that celestial glory
   which has been purchased for us by the blood of thy only begotten Son.
   Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Seventh

   In the lecture of yesterday the Prophet began to show from whom the
   Jews were to expect the vengeance of God, even from the Chaldeans, who
   would come, not by their own instinct, but by the hidden impulse of
   God. God indeed testifies that he should be the author of this war, and
   that the Chaldeans would fight, as it were, under his auspices. I am
   he, he says, who excites, etc. Then by calling the Chaldeans a bitter
   and hasty nation, he intended seriously to terrify the Jews, who had
   heedlessly despised all threatenings. [12] It was not indeed a subject
   of praise to the Chaldeans, that they were bitter and impetuous: but
   the Lord could turn these vices to a good purpose, inasmuch as he
   elicits light from darkness. When, therefore, we read that the
   Chaldeans were bitter, and also hasty, God thus intimates that he can
   employ the vices of men in executing his judgements, and yet contract
   hence no spot nor blemish; for we cannot possibly pollute him with our
   filth, as he scatters it far away by the brightness of his justice and
   equity.

   He afterwards adds, They shall march through the latitudes [13] of the
   earth, to possess habitations not their own. He means that there would
   be no obstacles in the way of the Chaldeans, but that they would spread
   themselves over the whole earth, and occupy regions far remote. For
   they who fear, dare not thus disperse themselves, but, on the contrary,
   they advance cautiously with a collected army; but those, who have
   already obtained victory, march on to lay waste the land. This is what
   the Prophet says the Chaldeans would do.

   The meaning is--that they would not come to carry on an uncertain
   warfare, but that they would enjoy a victory; for they would by an
   impetuous course fill the land, so as to occupy tents or habitations
   not their own. It was indeed a matter of blame in the Chaldeans, that
   they thus made inroads on their own neighbors: but, as I have said, God
   intended only to fill the Jews with terror, because he found that all
   threatenings were despised. He therefore meant to show how terrible the
   Chaldeans would be, and he confirms the same in the next verse.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] "Bitter" rendered "cruel" by Drusius. To be "bitter" in mind means
   passively, to be grieved, or distressed, or discontented, 1 Samuel
   22:2; and actively, to be revengeful, cruel, or inhuman, Jude
   18-25--"Hasty" signifies to be rash, inconsiderate, or soon excited and
   made angry. It is obvious that the order is reversed; what follows is
   mentioned first, and then what precedes it; for to be hasty in
   entertaining anger is first, and then follows cruelty in executing it.
   A similar order is found in the next verse; the worst feature is
   mentioned first, that the nation would be "terrible;" and then what is
   less, that it would be "fearful." This is what is often done by the
   writers of both of the Old and New Testament.--Ed.

   [13] The word, [mrhvym], means "breadths" or broad places, or wide
   regions, as Henderson renders it.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 1:7

   7. They are terrible and dreadful: their judgement and their dignity
   shall proceed of themselves.

   7. Terribilis et metuenda ipsa, ab ipsa judicium ejus (pro jure ponitur
   hoc nomen,) et exultatio (vel, dignitas) ejus egredietur.


   By saying that the Chaldeans would be terrible and dreadful, he praises
   not their virtues; but, as I have already reminded you, he shows that
   they would be prepared to do his service by executing his vengeance:
   and he so regulated his judgement, that he used their cruelty for a
   good purpose. Thus we see that the worst of men are in God's hand, as
   Satan is, who is their head; and yet that God is not implicated in
   their wickedness, as some insane men maintain; for they say--That if
   God governs the world by his providence, he becomes thus the author of
   sin, and men's sins are to be ascribed to him. But Scripture teaches us
   far otherwise,--that the wicked are led here and there by the hidden
   power of God, and that yet the fault is in them, when they do anything
   in a deceitful and cruel manner, and that God ever remains just,
   whatever use he may make of instruments, yea, the very worst.

   But when the Prophet adds, that its judgement would be from the nation
   itself, he means that the Chaldeans would act according to their own
   will. When any one indeed obeys laws, and willingly submits to them, he
   will freely allow either judges or umpires in case of a dispute; but he
   who will have all things done according to his own purpose repudiates
   all judges. The Prophet therefore means, that the Chaldeans would be
   their own judges, so that the Jews or others would complain in vain for
   any wrongs done to them. "They shall be," he says, "their own judges,
   and shall execute judgement, for they will not accept any arbitrators."
   The word judgement, taken in a good sense, is put here for law (jus);
   as though he said, "Whatever the Chaldeans will claim for themselves,
   theirs shall it be; for no one will dare to interfere, and they will
   not submit to the will of others; but their power shall be for law, and
   their sword for a tribunal." We now understand the Prophet's meaning;
   and we must ever bear in mind what I have already said,--That God had
   no participation in these vices; but it was necessary that the
   stubbornness of an irreclaimable people should be thus corrected, or at
   least broken down. The Lord in the meantime could use such instruments
   in such a way as to preserve some moderation in his judgements. It
   follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 1:8

   8. Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce
   than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves,
   and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle
   that hasteth to eat.

   8. Et velociores pardis equi ejus, et acutiores lupis vespertinis: et
   multiplicati sunt equites ejus, et equites ejus e longinquo venient;
   volabunt quasi aquila festinans ad comedendum (vel, ad cibum.)


   The design of these figurative expressions is the same. The Prophet had
   spoken of the cruelty of those enemies whom the Jews despised: he now
   adds, that they would be so active as to surpass in velocity both
   leopards and eagles, or to be at least equal to them. He then says
   first, that their horses would be swifter then leopards. The Jews might
   have eluded his threatenings, or at least have cherished their
   insensibility by a vain confidence, as we see how this vice prevails in
   the world; for they might have thought thus within themselves, "The
   Chaldeans are far away, and the danger of which the Prophet speaks
   cannot be so near at hand." Hence he declares that their horses would
   be swifter than leopards.

   He then adds, that they would be fiercer than the evening wolves. The
   wolf is a rapacious animal; and when he ranges about all the day in
   vain seeking what he may devour, then in the evening hunger kindles his
   rage. There is, therefore, nothing more dreadful than hungry wolves.
   But, as I have said, except they find some prey about the evening, they
   become the more furious. We shall meet with the same simile in
   Zephaniah 3:1. We now see the drift of the Prophet's words.

   He adds that their horsemen would be numerous [14] He now sets forth
   their power, lest the Jews should have recourse to vain hopes, because
   they might obtain some help either from the Egyptians or other
   neighbors. The Prophet shows that all such hopes would be wholly vain;
   for had they gathered auxiliaries from all quarters, still the
   Chaldeans would exceed them in power and number.

   He afterwards says, that their horsemen would come from a distance.
   Though they should have a long journey, yet weariness would not hinder
   and delay them in coming from a remote part. The toil of travelling
   would not weaken them, until they reached Judea. How so? Because it
   will fly, he says, (he speaks throughout of the nation itself,) as an
   eagle hastening to devour. This metaphor is also most suitable to the
   present purpose; for it signifies, that wherever the Chaldeans saw a
   prey, they would instantly come, as an eagle to any carcass it may
   observe. Let the distance be what it may, as soon as it sees a prey, it
   takes a precipitate flight, and is soon present to devour; for the
   rapidity of eagles, as it is well known, is astonishing.

   We now see that what we learn from the Prophet's words is substantially
   this,--that God's judgement ought to have been feared, because he
   purposed to employ the Chaldeans as his servants, whose cruel
   disposition and inhumanity would be dreadful: he also shows that the
   Chaldeans would be far superior in power and number; and in third place
   he makes it known, that they would possess an astonishing rapidity, and
   that though length of journey might be deemed a hindrance, they would
   yet be like eagles, which come like an arrow from heaven to earth,
   whenever a prey is observed by them. And eagles are not only rapid in
   their flight, but they possess also sharpness of sight; for we know
   that the eyes of eagles are remarkably keen and strong: and it is said
   that they cast away their young, if they find that they cannot look
   steadily at the sun; for they regard them as spurious. The Prophet then
   intimates that the Chaldeans would from a distance observe their prey:
   as the eagles, who are endued with incredible quickness of sight, see
   from mid air every carcass lying on the ground; so also would the
   Chaldeans quickly discover a prey, and come upon it in an instant. Let
   us proceed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [14] Multiples, various: but this is not the meaning of the verb
   [phsh]; it signifies to range at large, or to spread far and wide. The
   whole verse may be thus rendered,-- And swifter than leopards shall be
   its horses,
   And more eager than the wolves of the evening;
   Spread far and wide shall its horsemen;
   Yea, its horsemen from far shall come,
   And fly as an eagle hastening to devour. The horsemen are represented
   as sweeping the whole country, spreading themselves in all directions;
   and when espying a prey at a distance, they are said to fly to it like
   an eagle. The idea of being "numerous" or "abundant," as Junius and
   Tremelius render the verb, is derived from the Rabbins, and is not
   sanctioned by examples in Scripture. The rendering of the Septuagint is
   exippasontai, shall ride forth, and of Jerome, diffundentur, shall
   spread themselves. There is no occasion to borrow a meaning from
   Arabic, as Henderson does, and to render it "spread proudly along."
   Newcome follows our common version.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 1:9

   9. They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the
   east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.

   9. Tota (semper de ipsa gente loquitur, hoc est. totus ipse populus) ad
   praedam venict; occursus vultus ipsorum (jam in plurali numera
   loquitar) ventus orientalis, et colliget quasi arenam captivitatem.


   By saying that they would come to the prey, he means that they would
   have no trouble or labor, for they would be victorious before they had
   any contest, or had any war with their enemies. The meaning then is,
   that the Chaldeans would not come to spend much time in warfare, as
   when there is a strong power to resist; but that they would only come
   for the booty, for the Jews would be frightened, and instantly submit
   themselves. And by these words the Prophet intimates, that there would
   be neither strength nor courage in a people so refractory: for God thus
   debilitates the hearts of those who fiercely resist his word. Whenever,
   then, men become strong against God, he so melts their hearts, that
   they cannot resist their fellow-mortals; and thus he mocks their
   confidence, or rather their madness. Lest then the Jews should still
   harbor any hope from the chance of war, the Prophet says that the
   Chaldeans would only come for the prey, for all would become subject to
   them.

   He afterwards adds, that the meeting of their faces would be like the
   oriental wind. The word gmh, gime, means what is opposite; and its
   derivative signifies meeting or opposition (occursus.) We indeed know
   that the east wind was very injurious to the land of Judea, that it
   dried up vegetation, yea, that it consumed as it were the whole produce
   of the earth. The violence of that wind was also very great. Hence
   whenever the Prophets wished to express a violent impetuosity, they
   added this comparison of the east wind. It was therefore the same as
   though the Prophet had said that the Jews would now in vain flatter
   themselves; for as soon as they perceived the blowing of the east wind,
   they would flee away, knowing that they would be wholly unable to stand
   against it. [15]

   Hence follows what is added by the Prophets, He shall gather the
   captivity like the sand; that is, the king of Babylon shall without any
   trouble subdue all the people, and collect captives innumerable as the
   sand; for by the sand of the sea is meant an immense number of men. In
   short, the Prophet shows that the Jews were already conquered; because
   their striving and their contest had been with God, whom they had so
   often and so obstinately provoked; and also, because God had chosen for
   himself such servants as excelled in quickness, and power, and cruelty.
   This is the sum of the whole. He afterwards adds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [15] This clause has been variously interpreted. The Targum, Vulgate,
   and Symmachus, countenance the view given here. There is no help from
   the Septuagint, as no sense is given. The word [mgmch], only found
   here, is rendered by Symmachus, prosopsis, sight, aspect. Targum
   explains it by a word which signifies "front." Henderson and Lee regard
   this as its meaning. Others, as Newcome and Drusius render it, supping
   up, or absorption, and derive it from [gm'], to drink up, to absorb;
   and they regard the idea to be, that the very presence of the Chaldeans
   would absorb every thing like a scorching wind. But "the supping up of
   their faces shall be as the east wind," which is Newcome's version, is
   an odd phrase. The last word has [h] affixed to it, which is never the
   case when it means the east wind. It is by all admitted, that "towards
   the east" is its proper construction. Hence the most probable rendering
   of this passage is, "The aspect of their faces shall be towards the
   east;" and with this corresponds what follows, that they should "gather
   captives as the sand;" that is, that they might carry them away to the
   place where they turned their faces. The version of Henderson, which is
   essentially that of Symmachus, is the following,-- The aspect of their
   faces is like the east wind. He owns the difficulty as to the last
   word, and views it here as in an irregular form. Dathius gives this
   paraphrase,-- It will have its face direct towards the east. He says
   that the word [qdvm], by itself never means the pestilential wind from
   the east; but that when it means this, it has another word attached to
   it.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 1:10

   10. And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn
   unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap
   dust, and take it.

   10. Et ipse reges ridebit, et principes subsannatio ei; ipse omnem
   munitionem subsannabit; congregabit pulverem et capiet eam.


   The Prophet concludes the subject which he has been hitherto pursuing.
   He says that the Chaldeans would not come to engage in a doubtful war,
   but only to triumph over conquered nations. We indeed know that the
   Jews, though not excelling either in number or in riches, were yet so
   proud, that they looked down, as it were, with contempt on other
   nations, and we also know, that they vainly trusted in vain helps; for
   as they were in confederacy with the Egyptians, they thought themselves
   to be beyond the reach of danger. Hence the Prophet says, that kings
   and princes would be only a sport to the Chaldeans, and their
   fortresses would be only a derision to them. How so? For they will
   gather dust, he says; that is, will make a mound of the dust of the
   earth, and will thus penetrate into all fortified cities.

   In short the Prophet intended to cut off every hope from the Jews, that
   they might humble themselves before God; or he intended to take away
   every excuse if they repented not, as it indeed happened; for we know
   that they did not repent notwithstanding these warnings, until
   vengeance at length fully overtook them. He then adds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 1:11

   11. Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend,
   imputing this his power unto his god.

   11. Tunc mutabit spiritum, et transgredietur, et impie aget: haec
   virtus ejus deo ipsius.


   The Prophet now begins to give some comfort to the faithful, lest they
   should succumb under so grievous evils. He has hitherto directed his
   discourse to that irreclaimable people, but he now turns to the
   remnant; for there were always among them some of the faithful, though
   few, whom God never neglected; yea, for their sake often he sent his
   prophets; for though the multitude derived no benefit, yet the faithful
   understood that God did not threaten in vain, and were thus retained in
   his fear. This was the reason why the prophets were wont, after having
   spoken generally, to come down to the faithful, and as it were to
   comfort them apart and privately. And this difference ought to be
   noticed, as we have said elsewhere; for when the prophets denounce
   God's wrath, the discourse then is directed indiscriminately to the
   whole body of the people; but when they add promises, it is then as
   though they called the faithful to a private conference, and spake in
   their ear what had been committed to them by the Lord. The truth might
   have been useful to all, had they returned to a right mind; but as
   almost the whole people had hardened themselves in their vices, and as
   Satan had rendered stupid the minds and hearts of nearly all, it
   behaved the Prophet to have a special regard to the chosen of God. We
   now then apprehend his design.

   And he says--now he will change his spirit. He bids the faithful to
   entertain hope, because the Chaldeans, after having poured forth all
   their fury, will be punished by the Lord for their arrogance, for it
   will be intolerable. This may indeed seem frigid to ungodly men; for
   what wonder is it that the Chaldeans, after having obtained so many
   victories, should grow haughty and exult in their success, as is
   commonly the case? But as this is a fixed principle with us, that men's
   pride becomes intolerable to God when they extremely exult and preserve
   no moderation--this is a very powerful argument--that is, that
   whosoever thus raises his horns shall suddenly be laid prostrate by the
   Lord. And Scripture also ever sets this before us, that God beats down
   supercilious pride, and does this that we may know that destruction is
   nigh all the ungodly, when they thus grow violently mad, and know not
   that they are mortals. It was then for this reason that the Prophet
   mentions what he says here; it was that the faithful might hope for
   some end to the violence of their enemies, for God would check their
   pride when they should transgress. But he says--then He will change his
   spirit; not that there was before any humility in the Chaldeans, but
   that success inebriated them, yea, and deprived them of all reason. And
   it is a common thing that a person who has fortune as it were in his
   hand, forgets himself, and thinks himself no longer a mortal. Great
   kings do indeed confess that they are men; but we see how madness lays
   hold on them; for, as I have said, being deluded by prosperity, they
   deem themselves to be nothing less than gods.

   The Prophet refers here to the king of Babylon and all his people. He
   will change, he says, his spirit; that is, success will take away from
   him whatever reason and moderation he had. Now since the proud betray
   themselves and their disposition when fortune smiles on them, let us
   learn to form our judgement of men according to this experiment. If we
   would judge rightly of any man we must see how he bears good and bad
   fortune; for it may be that he who has borne adversity with a patient,
   calm and resigned mind, will disappoint us in prosperity, and will so
   elate himself as to be wholly another man. The Prophet then does not
   without reason speak of a change of spirit; for though the Chaldeans
   were before proud, they were not so extremely haughty as when their
   pride passed all bounds, after their many victories. He will change
   then his spirit; not that the Chaldeans were another kind of people,
   but that the Lord thus discovered their madness which was before hid.

   He then adds--he will pass over. The Prophet intended to express that
   when the Lord suffered the Chaldeans to rule far and wide, a way was
   thus opened for his judgements, which is far different from the
   judgement of the flesh. For the more power men acquire the more
   boldness they assume; and it seemed to tend to the establishing of
   their power that they knew how to use their success. But the Lord, as I
   have said, was secretly preparing a way to destroy them, when they thus
   became proud and passed all bounds; hence the Prophet does not simply
   condemn the haughtiness and pride of the Chaldeans, but shows that a
   way is already open, as it were, for God's judgement, that he might
   destroy them, inasmuch as they would render themselves intolerable.

   He afterwards adds--and shall act impiously. The verb 'sm, ashem I
   refer to the end of the verse--where he ascribes his power to his own
   god. And the Prophet adds this explanation, in order that the Jews
   might know what kind of sin would be the sin of the king of Babylon. He
   then charges him with sacrilege, because he would think that he had
   become the conqueror of Judea through the kindness of his idol, so that
   he would make nothing of the power and glory of the true God. Since
   then the Babylonian would transfer God's glory to his own idol, his own
   ruin would be thus made ripe; for the Lord would undertake his own
   cause, and execute vengeance on such a sacrilege; for he speaks here no
   doubt of the Babylonian, and according to his view, when he says--

   This his strength is that of his god; but were any inclined to explain
   this of the true God, as some do, he would make a harsh and a forced
   construction; for the Babylonians did not worship the true God, but
   were devoted, as it is well known, to their own superstitions. The
   Prophet then no doubt makes known here to the faithful the pride with
   which the Babylonians would become elated, and thus provoke God's wrath
   against themselves; and also the sacrilegious boasting in which they
   would indulge, ascribing the victories given them to their own idols,
   which could not be done without daring reproach to the true God. [16]
   It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [16] The foregoing verse is one on which no satisfactory explanation
   has been given. The one adopted here has been materially followed by
   Vatablus, Druius, and Dathius, except as to the last clause. As to the
   first part of the verse Henderson gives the best sense, for it
   corresponds with "changing" to [chlph] and "courage" to [rvch], (see
   Joshua 2:11; 5:1;) and of "passing onward" to [vr], and not of "passing
   over," i.e. bounds or moderation, which it seems not to have, when
   used, as here, intransitively. The passing here is evidently what is
   referred to in verse 6, as the renewing of courage would arise, from
   the success mentioned in verse 10. The best exposition of the last
   clause is what Grotius has suggested, and has been followed by Marckius
   and Dathius--that the Chaldeans made their own strength their God; (see
   verse 16;) the rendering then would be this,-- Then will it renew
   courage, And pass through,
   and become guilty; -- This is strength being its god,
   or literally, This is strength for its god. There is an inconsistency
   in our version, and also in Calvin, as to this passage, from verse 6 to
   the end of this verse. The number is changed. The "bitter nation,"
   mentioned in verse 6, is meant throughout; and we ought to adopt the
   plural number throughout, as Newcome does, or, according to Henderson,
   the singular. There is no change of person, as some suppose, at the
   beginning of verse 10; for [hv'], there, and [hv'] in verse 6 is the
   same--the "bitter nation."--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 1:12

   12. Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we
   shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgement; and, O
   mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.

   12. Annon tu ab initio, (vel, jampridem,) Jehova, Deus meus? sanctus
   meus, non moriemur; Jehova, ad judicium posiusti eum; et fortis, ad
   castigationem fundasti eum.


   The Prophet now exulting, according to what all the faithful feel,
   shows the effect of what he has just mentioned; for as ungodly men
   wantonly rise up against God, and, while Satan renders them insane,
   throw out swelling words of vanity, as though they could by speaking
   confound earth and heaven; so also the faithful derive a holy
   confidence from God's word, and set themselves against them, and
   overcome their ferocity by the magnanimity and firmness of their own
   minds, so that they can intrepidly boast that they are happy and
   blessed even in the greatest miseries.

   This then is what the prophet means when he adds--Art not thou our God?
   The question is much more emphatical than if he had simply declared
   that the true God was worshipped in Judea, and would therefore be the
   protector of that nation; for when the Prophet puts a question, he
   means, according to what is commonly understood in Hebrew, that the
   thing admits of no doubt. "What! art not thou our God?" We hence see
   that there is a contrast between the wicked and impious boastings in
   which the profane indulge, and the holy confidence which the faithful
   have, who exult in their God. But that the discourse is addressed to
   God rather than to the ungodly is not done without reason, for it would
   have been useless to contend with the wicked. This is indeed sometimes
   necessary, for when the reprobate openly reproach God we cannot
   restrain ourselves; nor is it right that we refrain from testifying
   that we regard all their slanders as of no account; but we cannot so
   courageously oppose their audacity as when we have the matter first
   settled between us and God, and be able to say with the Prophets--"Thou
   art our God." Whosoever then would boldly contend with the ungodly must
   first have to do with God, and confirm and ratify as it were that
   compact which God has proposed to us, even that we are his people, and
   that he in his turn will be always our God. As then God thus covenants
   with us, our faith must be really made firm, and then let us go forth
   and contend against all the ungodly. This is the order which the
   Prophet observes here, and what is to be observed by us--Art not thou
   our God?

   He also adds--long since, mqdm, mekodam, by which word the Prophet
   invites the attention of the faithful to the covenant which God had
   made, not yesterday nor the day before that, with his people, but many
   ages before, even 400 years before he redeemed their fathers from
   Egypt. Since then the favor of God to the Jews had been confirmed for
   so long a time, it is not without reason that the Prophet says
   here--Thou art our God from the beginning; that is, "the religion which
   we embrace has been delivered to us by thy hands, and we know that thou
   art its author; for our faith recumbs not on the opinion of men, but is
   sustained by thy word. Since, then, we have found so often and in so
   many ways, and for so many years, that thou art our God, there is now
   no room for doubt." [17]

   He then subjoins--we shall not die. What the Jews say of this place,
   that it had been corrected by the scribes, seems not to me probable;
   for the reason they give is very frivolous. They suppose that it was
   written lo tamut, Thou diest not, and that the letter nun had been
   introduced, "we shall not die," because the expression offended those
   scribes, as though the Prophet compared God to men, and ascribed to him
   a precarious immortality; but they would have been very foolish
   critics. I therefore think that the word was written by the Prophet as
   we now read it, Thou art our God, we shall not die. Some explain this
   as a prayer--"let us not die;" and the future is often taken in this
   sense in Hebrew; but this exposition is not suitable to the present
   passage; for the Prophet, as I have already said, rises up here as a
   conqueror, and disperses as mists all those foolish boastings of which
   he had been speaking, as though he said--"we shall not die, for we are
   under the protection of God."

   I have already explained why he turns his discourse to God: but this is
   yet the conclusion of the argument,--that as God had adopted that
   people, and received them into favor, and testified that he would be
   their defender, the Prophet confidently draws this inference,--that
   this people cannot perish, for they are preserved by God. No power of
   the world, nor any of its defences, can indeed afford us this security;
   for whatever forces may all mortals bring either to protect or help us,
   they shall all perish together with us. Hence, the protection of God
   alone is that which can deliver us from the danger of death. We now
   perceive why the Prophet joins together these two things, "Thou art our
   God," and "We shall not die;" nor can indeed the one be separated from
   the other; for when we are under the protection of God, we must
   necessarily continue safe and safe for ever; not that we shall be free
   from evils, but that the Lord will deliver us from thousand deaths, and
   ever preserve our life in safety. When only he affords us a taste of
   eternal salvation, some spark of life will ever continue in our hearts,
   until he shows to us, when at length redeemed, as I have already said,
   from thousand deaths, the perfection of that blessed life, which is now
   promised to us, but as yet is looked for, and therefore hid under the
   custody of hope.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [17] Most commentators agree with our version in connecting "from the
   beginning," or "from eternity," with Jehovah, and not as Calvin seems
   to do, with "God." His view is evidently the most consonant with the
   design of the passage, and countenanced by the Septuagint, for Jehovah
   is rendered kurie, in the vocative case. To assert the eternity of God
   seems not to be necessary here; but to say that he had been from old
   times the God of Israel is what is suitable to the context. The Prophet
   in saying "my God," identifies himself with the people; for he says
   afterwards, "we shall not die." Viewed in this light the former part of
   the verse may be thus rendered,-- Art not thou from of old, O Jehovah,
   my God! My holy one, we shall not die. The reason for which he calls
   him "holy" will appear from what the next verse contains. The Prophet
   seems to sustain himself by two considerations--that Jehovah was the
   God of Israel, and that he was a holy God. When he says "we shall not
   die," he means, no doubt, as Marckius observes, that the people as a
   nation would not be destroyed, for he had prophesied of their
   subjugation and captivity by the Chaldeans. What he had in view was the
   Church of God, respecting which promises had been made.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou settest around us so many terrors,
   we may know that we ought to be roused, and to resist the sloth and
   tardiness of our flesh, so that thou mayest fortify us by a different
   confidence: and may we so recumb on thine aid, that we may boldly
   triumph over our enemies, and never doubt, but that thou wilt at length
   give us the victory over all the assaults of Satan and of the wicked;
   and may we also so look to thee, that our faith may wholly rest on that
   eternal and immutable covenant, which has been confirmed for us by the
   blood of thy only Son, until we shall at length be united to him who is
   our head, after having passed through all the miseries of the present
   life, and having been gathered into that eternal inheritance, which thy
   Son has purchased for us by his own blood. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lecture One hundred and Eighth

   We began yesterday to explain the words of the Prophet, by which he
   encouraged himself and the faithful, and obtained support under
   circumstances bordering on despair; for he turned to God, when he saw
   the wicked, not only elated with prosperity, but also pouring forth
   blasphemies against the living God. The Prophet then says, that those
   who are under God's protection shall not perish. Of this he felt
   assured within himself. The declaration, as I have said, is much more
   striking, as the Prophet turns all his thoughts towards God, than if he
   had publicly and loudly declared what he testified, as it were, in a
   private conference.

   But it was not without reason that he said, "Thou, my God, my holy
   one;" as though he had said, "I trust in thee, inasmuch as I am one of
   thy chosen people." He does not indeed speak here in his own private
   name, but includes with himself the whole Church; for this privilege
   belonged to all the children of Abraham, as they had been set apart by
   the gratuitous adoption of God, and were a royal priesthood. This is
   the reason why the Prophet says, Thou, my God, my holy one. For the
   Jews were wont thus to call God, because they had been chosen from the
   rest of the world. And their holiness was, that God had deigned to take
   them as his people, having rejected others, while yet there was by
   nature no difference between them. [18]

   There is, moreover, much weight in the words which follow, Jehovah! for
   judgement has thou set him. This temptation ever occurs to us, whenever
   we strive to put our trust in God--What does this mean? for God now
   forsakes us, and exposes us to the caprice of the wicked they are
   allowed to do what they please, and God interferes not. How, then, can
   we cherish hope under these perplexities?" The Prophet now sets up a
   shield against this temptations--"Thou," he says, "hast appointed him
   for judgement." For he ascribes it to God's providence, that the
   Assyrians had with so much wantonness wasted the land, or would waste
   it when they came; for he speaks of things yet future--"Thou," he says,
   "hast appointed him for judgement."

   This is a truth much needed: for Satan darkens, as with clouds, the
   favor of God, when any adversity happens to us, and when God himself
   thus proves our faith. But adversities are as it were clouds, excluding
   us from seeing God's fervor, as the light of the sun appears not to us
   when the sky is darkened. If, indeed, the mass of evils be so great and
   so thick, that our minds are overwhelmed, they are not clouds, but the
   thick darkness of night. In that case our faith cannot stand firm,
   except the providence of God comes to our view, so that we may know, in
   the midst of such confusion, why he permits so much liberty to the
   wicked, and also how their attempts may turn out, and what may be the
   issue. Except then we be fully persuaded, that God by his secret
   providence regulates all these confusions, Satan will a hundred times a
   day, yea every moment, shake that confidence which ought to repose in
   God. We now see how opportunely the Prophet adds this clause. He had
   said, "Art not thou our God? we shall not die." He now subjoins this by
   way of anticipation, "The Assyrians indeed do lay waste thy land as
   with an unbridled wantonness, they plunder thy people, and with
   impunity slay the innocent; but, O Lord, this is not done but by thy
   permission: Thou overrules all these confused proceedings, nor is all
   this done by thee without a cause. Thou, Jehovah, hast for judgement
   appointed him.--Judgement is to be taken for chastisement.

   But the Prophet repeats the same thing, and, being strong, thou hast
   for correction established him. Some render tsvr, tsur strong, in the
   accusative case, and give a twofold explanation. One party apply the
   term to the Jews, who were to be subdued by hard means, since they were
   so refractory; and hence they think that the Jews are called strong,
   because they were like stones. Others give this meaning, Thou hast made
   him strong to correct; that is, Thou hast given him strength, by which
   he will chastise us. But as this is one of God's titles, I doubt not
   but that the two clauses correspond. He now, then, gives this name to
   God. Having given him his name as an eternal God, Thou, Jehovah, etc.;
   he now calls him strong. He puts tsvr, tsur to correspond with Jehovah;
   and then to correct, to correspond with judgement. We hence see how
   well the whole context agrees, and how the words answer, the one to the
   other. Then it is, Thou, strong one, hast established him to correct.
   But why does the Prophet call him strong? though this title, as I have
   said, is commonly ascribed to God, yet the Prophet, I have no doubt,
   had regard to the circumstances at the time. It is indeed difficult to
   retain this truth,--that the world is ruled by the secret counsel of
   God, when things are turned upside down: for the profane then glamour
   against God, and charge him with listlessness; and others cry out, that
   all things are thus changed fortuitously and at random; and hence they
   call fortune blind. It is then difficult, as I have said, to retain a
   fast hold on this truth. The Prophet, therefore, in order to support
   his own weakness, sets before himself this title of God, Thou, the
   strong God, or the rock, etc.; for tsvr, tsur means properly a rock,
   but it is to be taken here for God of strength. Why? "Behold, we indeed
   see revolutions, which not only make our faith to totter, but also
   dissipate as it were all our thoughts: but how much soever the world
   revolve in confusion, yet God is a rock; His purpose fails not, nor
   wavers; but remains ever firm." We now then see why the Prophet calls
   God strong. [19]

   Thou the strong one, he says, hast established him. He expresses more
   by the word established, than in the first clause: for he prepared
   himself with firmness against continued evils, in case God (as it might
   be easily conjectured) would not give immediate relief to his people,
   but add calamities to calamities. Should God then join evils to evils,
   the Prophet prepares himself for perseverance; "Thou," he says, "the
   strong one hast established him;" that is, "Though the Assyrian should
   not only like a whirlwind or a violent tempest rush upon us, but also
   continue to oppress us, as though he were a pestilence attached to the
   land, or some fixed mountain, yet thou, Lord, hast established him."
   For what purpose? to correct. But the Prophet could not have said this,
   had he not known that God justly chastised his people. Not only for his
   own sake did he say this; but he intended also, by his own example, to
   lead the faithful to make the same holy and pious confession.

   The two clauses of this sentence then are these, that though the
   Assyrian would rage with unbridled wantonness, like a cruel wild beast,
   he would yet be restrained by the hidden power of God, to whom it
   peculiarly belongs to overrule by his secret providence the confusions
   of this world. This is one thing. The Prophet also ascribes justice to
   God's power, and thus confesses his own guilt and that of the people;
   for the Lord would justly use so severe a scourge, because the people
   needed such a correction. Let us now go on--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [18] It seems that Calvin regarded "my holy one," as equivalent to "my
   sanctifier;" he who had separated the people from others to be his own.
   The primary meaning of [qds] is no doubt to separate a thing from a
   common use to a sacred one; but whether in this connection it has this
   meaning is not quite certain. "The holy one of Israel" is a phrase
   several times used by Isaiah, see chapter 30:11; 43:3, etc. The
   sentence here may be rendered, "God of my holiness," or "My God, my
   holiness."--Ed.

   [19] Many agree in this view, Drusius, Piscator, Marckius, Henderson,
   etc. The Septuagint affords no help. The rendering of Symmachus is
   krataion, strong, and of Aquila, stereon, firm; then it would be, "and
   strong (or firm) for correction hast thou established him." Grotius,
   and also Newcome, adopt this meaning. And thou hast founded them on a
   rock to chasten us This is, no doubt, the easiest and most natural
   construction. See Ezekiel 3:9. God rendered the Chaldean nation firm,
   and strong, and resolute, to punish the Jews.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 1:13

   13. Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on
   iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and
   holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more
   righteous than he?

   13. Mundus es oculis, ne videas malum, et aspicere ad molestiam non
   potes (non poteris, adverbum;) quare aspicis transgressores? dissimulas
   quum impius devorat justiorem se?


   The Prophet here expostulates with God, not as at the beginning of the
   chapter; for he does not here, with a holy and calm mind, undertake the
   defense of God's glory, but complains of injuries, as men do when
   oppressed, who go to the judge and implore his protection. This
   complaint, then, is to be distinguished from the former one; for at the
   beginning of the chapter the Prophet did not plead his own cause or
   that of the people; but zeal for God's glory roused him, so that he in
   a manner asked God to take vengeance on so great an obstinacy in
   wickedness; but he now comes down and expresses the feelings of men;
   for he speaks of the thoughts and sorrows of those who had suffered
   injuries under the tyranny of their enemies.

   And he says, O God, thou art pure in eyes, thou lookest not on evil.
   Some render the verb thvr, theur in the imperative mood, clear the
   eyes; but they are mistaken; for the verse contains two parts, the one
   contrary to the other. The Prophet reasons from the nature of God, and
   then he states what is of an opposite character. Thou, God, he says,
   art pure in eyes; hence thou canst not look on evil; it is not
   consistent with thy nature to pass by the vices of men, for every
   iniquity is hateful to thee. Thus the Prophet sets before himself the
   nature of God. Then he adds, that experience is opposed to this; for
   the wicked, he says, exult; and while they miserably oppress the
   innocent, no one affords any help. How is this, except that God sleeps
   in heaven, and neglects the affairs of men? We now then understand the
   Prophet's meaning in this verse. [20]

   By saying that God is pure in eyes, he assumes what ought to be deemed
   certain and indubitable by all men of piety. But as God's justice does
   not always appear, the Prophet has a struggle; and he shows that he in
   a manner vacillated, for he did not see in the state of things before
   him what yet his piety dictated to him, that is, that God was just and
   upright. It is indeed true, that the second part of the verse borders
   on blasphemy: for though the Prophet ever thought honourably and
   reverently of God, yet he murmurs here, and indirectly charges God with
   too much tardiness, as he connived at things, while he saw the just
   shamefully oppressed by the wicked. But we must notice the order which
   the Prophet keeps. For by saying that God is pure in eyes, he no doubt
   restrains himself. As there was danger lest this temptation should
   carry him too far, he meets it in time, and includes himself, in a
   manner, within this boundary--that we ought to retain a full conviction
   of God's justice. The same order is observed by Jeremiah when he says,
   I know, Lord, that thou art just, but how is it that the ungodly do
   thus pervert all equity? and thou either takest no notice, or dost not
   apply any remedy. I would therefore freely contend with thee.' The
   Prophet does not immediately break out into such an expression as this,
   "O Lord, I will contend with thee in judgement:" but before he mentions
   his complaint, knowing that his feelings were strongly excited, he
   makes a kind of preface, and in a manner restrains himself, that he
   might check that extreme ardor which might have otherwise carried him
   beyond due bounds; "Thou art just, O Lord," he says. In a similar
   manner does our prophet speak here, Thou art pure in eyes, so as not to
   behold evil; and thou canst not look on trouble

   Since, he says, thou canst not look on trouble, we find that he
   confirms himself in that truth--that the justice of God cannot be
   separated from his very nature: and by saying, l' tvkl, la tucal, "thou
   canst not," it is the same as though he had said, "Thou, O Lord, art
   just, because thou art God; and God, because thou art just." For these
   two things cannot be separated, as both the eternity, and the very
   being of God, cannot stand without his justice. We hence see how
   strenuously the Prophet struggled against his own impetuosity, so that
   he might not too much indulge himself in the complaint, which
   immediately follows.

   For he then asks, according to the common judgement of the flesh, Why
   dost thou look on, when the ungodly devours one more just than himself?
   The Prophet here does not divest God of his power, but speaks in doubt,
   and contends not so much with God as with himself. A profane man would
   have said, "There is no God, there is no providence," or, "He cares not
   for the world, he takes his pleasure in heaven." But the Prophet says,
   "Thou seest, Lord." Hence he ascribes to God what peculiarly belongs to
   him--that he does not neglect the world which he has created. At the
   same time he here inclines two ways, and alternates; Why does thou look
   on, when the ungodly devours one more just than himself? He says not
   that the world revolves by chance, nor that God takes his delight and
   ease in heaven, as the Epicureans hold; but he confesses that the world
   is seen by God, and that he exercises care over the affairs of men:
   notwithstanding, as he could not see his way clear in a state of things
   so confused, he argues the point rather with himself than with God. We
   now see the import of this sentence. The Prophet, however, proceeds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [20] Adjectives and participles in Hebrew commonly take a plural form,
   but not always, as evidently in the present case; for the word for
   "pure," though singular, will admit of a better construction with
   "eyes" than in any other way; and so Grotius renders the clause, "Purer
   are thine eyes," etc.; which is better than our version, followed by
   Newcome and Henderson. The whole passage will thus read better:-- Purer
   are thine eyes than to behold evil,
   And to look on wickedness thou art not able:
   Why then lookest thou on the perfidious,
   And art still when the wicked swallows up
   One more righteous than himself?
   And makest man to be like the fish of the sea,
   Like the reptile which has no ruler? "Evil" means here wrong,
   injustice; the corresponding clause is "the wicked" swallowing up or
   oppressing his better. The Jews were bad, but better than the
   Chaldeans. "Wickedness," [ml], is such a mischief as is done through
   treachery: hence in the next line, which, according to the style of the
   Prophets, corresponds with this, "the perfidious" are mentioned,
   improperly rendered "plunderers" by Henderson, and "transgressors" by
   Newcome. The Chaldeans had been the allies of the Jews. With respect to
   the reptile or the crawling fish, such as keep to the bottom of the
   waters, why is it said to be without a ruler? Is it more insulated and
   less gregarious, so to speak, than other fish? If so, "without a ruler"
   has an obvious meaning.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 1:14, 15

   14. And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things,
   that have no ruler over them?

   14. Facis hominem quasi pisces maris, quasi reptile, quod caret duce
   (ad verbum, non est dux in illo.)

   15. They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their
   net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are
   glad.

   15. Totum hamo suo attrahet, colliget in sagenam suam, et congregabit
   in rete suum; propterea gaudebit et exultabit (hoc est, gaudet et
   exultat.)


   He goes on, as it has been said, in his complaint; and by a comparison
   he shows that the judgement would be such as though God turned away
   from men, so as not to check the violence of the wicked, nor oppose his
   hand to their wantonness, in order to restrain them. Since, then, every
   one would oppress another as he exceeded him in power, and would with
   increased insolence rise up against the miserable and the poor, the
   Prophet compares man to the fish of the sea,--"What can this mean?" he
   says. "For men have been created after God's image: why then does not
   some justice appear among them? When one devours another, and even one
   man oppresses almost the whole world, what can be the meaning of this?
   God seems to sport with human affairs. For if he regards men as his
   children, why does he not defend them by his power? But we see one man
   (for he speaks of the Assyrian king) so enraged and so cruel, as though
   the rest of the world were like fish or reptiles." Thou makes men, he
   says, like reptiles or fishes; and then he adds, He draws up the whole
   by his hook, he collects them into his drag, he gathers them into his
   net, he exults [21]

   We now see what the Prophet means--that God would, as it were, close
   his eyes, while the Assyrians wantonly laid waste the whole world: and
   when this tyranny should reach the holy land, what else could the
   faithful think but that they were forsaken by God? And there is
   nothing, as I have already said, more monstrous, than that iniquitous
   tyranny should thus prevail among men; for they have all, from the
   least to the greatest, been created after God's image. God then ought
   to exercise peculiar care in preserving mankind; his paternal love and
   solicitude ought in this respect to appear evident: but when men are
   thus destroyed with impunity, and one oppresses almost all the rest,
   there seems indeed to be no divine providence. For how will it be that
   he will care for either birds, or oxen, or asses, or trees, or plants,
   when he will thus forsake men, and bring no aid in so confused a state?
   We now understand the drift of what the Prophet says.

   But yet he does not, as I have already said, take away from God his
   power, nor does he here rail against fortune, as many cavillers do.
   Thou makest men, he says: he ascribes to God what cannot be taken from
   him,--that he governs the world. But as to God's justice, he hesitates,
   and appeals to God. Though the Prophet seems here to rush headlong like
   insane men; yet if we consider all things, we shall see that he
   strenuously contended with his temptations, and even in these words
   some sparks at least of faith will shine forth, which are sufficient to
   show to us the great firmness of the Prophet. For this especially is
   worthy of being noticed,--that the Prophet turns himself to God. The
   Epicureans, when they glamour against God, for the most part, seek the
   ear of the multitude; and so they speak evil of God and withdraw
   themselves at a distance from him; for they do not think that he
   exercises any care over the world. But the Prophet continually
   addresses God. He knew then that God was the governor of all things. He
   also desires to be extricated from thoughts so thorny and perplexing;
   and from whom does he seek relief? From God himself. When the profane
   wantonly deride God, they indulge themselves, and seek nothing else but
   to become hardened in their own impious conjectures: but the Prophet
   comes to God himself, "How does this happen, O Lord?" As though he had
   said,

   "Thou sees how I am distracted, and also held fast bound--distracted by
   many absurd thoughts, so that I am almost confounded, and held fast
   bound by great perplexities, from which I cannot extricate myself. Do
   thou, O Lord, unfold to me these knots, and concentrate my scattered
   thoughts, that I may understand what is true, and what I am to believe;
   and especially remove from me this doubt, lest it should shake my
   faith; O Lord, grant that I may at length know and fully understand how
   thou art just, and overrules, consistently with perfect equity, those
   things which seem to be so confused."

   It also happens sometimes that the ungodly, as it were, openly revile
   God, a satanic rage having taken possession on them. But the case was
   far different with the Prophet; for finding himself overwhelmed and his
   mind not able to sustain him under so heavy trials, he sought relief,
   and as we have said, applied to God himself.

   By saying, He therefore rejoices and exults, he increases the
   indignity; for though the Lord may for a time permit the wicked to
   oppress the innocent, yet when he finds them glorying in their vices
   and triumphing, so great a wantonness ought the more to kindle his
   vengeance. That the Lord then should still withhold himself, seems
   indeed very strange. But the Prophet proceeds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [21] The construction of this verse can only be understood by a
   reference to the preceeding verse; where two things are mentioned, the
   fish of the sea and the reptile: as it is customary with the Prophets,
   the first clause was rasied up by a hook, and the fish were enclosed in
   a net, or collected by a drag. The reptile, [rms], is in the singular
   number, and used in a collective sense, and [klh], every one, at the
   beginning of this verse, is in the same number. This entirely removes
   the difficulty which critics have felt, and made them to propose
   emendations. The verse then would read thus:-- Every one (i.e. every
   reptile) by a hook he raises up
   He draws them out (i.e. the fish) by his net,
   And collects them by his drag;
   He therefore rejoices, and exults. To "gather then into the net" can
   hardly be sense; nor is "in the net" much better. The drawing out and
   the collecting were evidently by the net and the drag; the preposition,
   [v], has very commonly this meaning, as en in Greek. The representation
   here is, that every means would be employed: men being compared to
   fishes, some are set forth as creeping along the bottom, and others as
   swimming at large at all depths; and then the fisherman, the Chaldean
   comes, and draws out the first by a fishing-hook, and the rest by a net
   and a drag; so that he takes them all.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 1:16

   16. Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto
   their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat
   plenteous.

   16. Propterea sacrificabit sagenae suae, et suffitum offeret reti suo,
   quia in illis pinguis portio ejus, et cibus ejus lautus.


   The Prophet confirms the closing sentence of the last verse; for he
   explains what that joy was of which he had spoken, even the joy by
   which the wicked, as it were, designedly provoke God against
   themselves. It is indeed an abominable thing when the ungodly take
   delight in their vices; but it is still more atrocious when they deride
   God himself. Such, then, is the account now added by the Prophet, as
   though he had said, "Not only do the ungodly felicitate themselves
   while thou sparest them, or for a time bearest with them; but they now
   rise up against thee and deride all thy majesty, and openly blaspheme
   against heaven itself; for they sacrifice to their own net, and offer
   incense to their drag." By this metaphor the Prophet intimates, that
   the wicked do not only become hardened when they succeed in their
   vices, but that they also ascribe to themselves the praise of justice;
   for they consider that to be rightly done which has been attended with
   success. They thus dethrone God, and put themselves in his place. We
   now then see the Prophet's meaning.

   But this passage discovers to us the secret impiety of all those who do
   not serve God sincerely and with an honest mind. There is indeed
   imprinted on the hearts of men a certain conviction respecting the
   existence of a God; for none are so barbarous as not to have some sense
   of religion: and thus all are rendered inexcusable, as they carry in
   their hearts a law which is sufficient to make them a thousand times
   guilty. But at the same time the ungodly, and those who are not
   illuminated by faith, bury this knowledge, for they are enveloped in
   themselves: and when some recollection of God creeps in, they are at
   first impressed, and ascribe some honor to him; but this is evanescent,
   for they soon suppress it as much as they can; yea they even strive to
   extinguish (though they cannot) this knowledge and whatever light they
   have from heaven. This is what the Prophet now graphically sets forth
   in the person of the Assyrian king. He had before said, "This power is
   that of his God." He had complained that the Assyrians would give to
   their idols what was peculiar to God alone, and thus deprive him of his
   right: but he says now, that they would sacrifice to their own drag,
   and offer incense to their net. This is a very different thing: for how
   could they sacrifice to their idols, if they ascribed to their drag
   whatever victories they had gained? Now, by the words drag and net, the
   Prophet means their efforts, strength, forces, power, counsels, and
   policies as they call them, and whatever else there be which profane
   men arrogate to themselves. But what is it to sacrifice to their own
   net? The Assyrian did this, because he thought that he surpassed all
   others in craftiness, because he thought himself so courageous as not
   to hesitate to make war with all nations, regarding himself well
   prepared with forces and justified in his proceedings; and because he
   became successful and omitted nothing calculated to ensure victory.
   Thus the Assyrian, as I have said, regarded as nothing his idols; for
   he put himself in the place of all the gods. But if it be asked whence
   came his success, we must answer, that the Assyrian ought to have
   ascribed it all to the one true God: but he thought that he prospered
   through his own valour. If we refer to counsel, it is certain that God
   is he who governs the counsels and minds of men; but the Assyrian
   thought that he gained everything by his own skill. If, again, we speak
   of strength, whence was it? and of courage, whence was it, but from
   God? but the Assyrian appropriated all these things to himself. What
   regard, then, had he for God? We see how he now takes away all honor
   even from his own idols, and attributes everything to himself.

   But this sin, as I have already said, belongs to all the ungodly; for
   where God's Spirit does not reign, there is no humility, and men ever
   swell with inward pride, until God thoroughly cleanse them. It is then
   necessary that God should empty us by his special grace, that we may
   not be filled with this satanic pride, which is innate, and which
   cannot by any means be shaken off by us, until the Lord regenerates us
   by his Spirit. And this may be seen especially in all the kings of this
   world. They indeed confess that kings rule through God's grace; and
   then when they gain any victory, supplications are made, vows are paid.
   But were any one to say to those conquerors, "God had mercy on you,"
   the answer would be, "What! was then my preparation nothing? did I not
   provide many things beforehand? did I not attain the friendship of
   many? did I not form confederacies? did I not foresee such and such
   disadvantages? did I not opportunely provide a remedy?" In a word, they
   sacrifice apparently to God, but afterwards they have a regard mainly
   to their drag and their net, and make nothing of God. Well would it be
   were these things not so evident. But since the Spirit of God sets
   before us a lively image of the fact, let us learn what true humility
   is, and that we then only have this, when we think that we are nothing,
   and can do nothing, and that it is God alone who not only supports and
   continues us in life, but also governs us by his Spirit, and that it is
   he who sustains our hearts, gives courage, and then blesses us, so as
   to render prosperous what we may undertake. Let us hence learn that God
   cannot be really glorified, except when men wholly empty themselves.

   He then adds, because in (or by) them is his fat portion and his rich
   meat. Though some render vr'h, berae, choice meat, and others, fat
   meat, I yet prefer the meaning of rich. [22] His meat then will be
   rich. The Prophet intimates here that men are so blinded by prosperity
   that they sacrifice to themselves, and hence the more deserving of
   reproof is their ingratitude; for the more liberally God deals with us
   the more reason, no doubt, there is why we ought to glorify him. But
   when men, well supplied and fully satisfied, thus swell with pride and
   sacrifice to themselves, is not their impiety in this manner more
   completely discovered? But the Prophet not only proves that the
   Assyrians abused God's bounty, but he shows in their person what is the
   disposition of the whole world. For when men accumulate great wealth,
   and pile up a great heap from the property of others, they become more
   and more blinded. We hence see that we ought justly to fear the evil of
   prosperity, lest our fatness should so increase that we can see
   nothing; for the eyes are dimmed by excessive fatness. Let this then be
   ever remembered by us. The Prophet then concludes his discourse: but as
   one verse of the first chapter only remains, I shall briefly notice it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [22] "His fat portion and rich meat" were the people whom he conquered.
   The words verbatim are these,-- For through them abundant his portion,
   And his meat well-fed. The comparison of the drag and net is continued;
   by which is signified military strength and power. See Isaiah
   10:13.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 1:17

   17. Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to
   slay the nations?

   17. An propterea extendet [23] sagenam suam, et assiduus erit ad
   occidendas gentes, ut non parcat (alii vertuat, annon negative; atqui
   debuisset esse [vk-l 'lh])?


   This is an affirmative question, "Shall they therefore;" which,
   however, requires a negative answer. Then all interpreters are
   mistaken; for they think that the Prophet here complains, that he
   presently extends his net after having made a capture, but he rather
   means, "Is he ever to extend his net?" that is, "How long, O Lord, wilt
   thou permit the Assyrians to proceed to new plunders, so as to be like
   the hunter, who after having taken a boar or a stag, is more eager, and
   immediately renews his hunting; or like the fisherman, who having
   filled his little ship, with more avidity pursues his vocation? Wilt
   thou, Lord, he says, suffer the Assyrians to become more assiduous in
   their work of destruction?" And he shows how unworthy they were of
   God's forbearance, for they slew the nations. "I speak not here," he
   says, "either of fish or of any other animal, nor do I speak of this or
   that man, but I speak of many nations. As these slaughters are thus
   carried on through the whole world, how long, Lord, shall they be
   unpunished? for they will never cease." We now see the purport of the
   Prophet's complaint; but we shall find in the next lecture how he
   recovers himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [23] The verb is [yryq], a hiphil form, and means, to evacuate, to
   empty, to empty out, and this is the sense in which it is taken here by
   Drusius, Marckius, Newcome, and Henderson. But the verb means also to
   draw out, i.e., a sword, Exodus 15:9, Leviticus 26:33, and to draw
   forth, i.e., an army, Genesis 14:14, and this is the meaning given to
   it by Grotius, Junius, and the Septuagint. To draw forth, to extend, or
   to expand, seems most in accordance with the drift of the passage. To
   empty his net, and that for the sake of filling it again, which must be
   what is implied, is rather a farfetched notion.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as it cannot be but that, owing to the
   infirmity of our flesh, we must be shaken and tossed here and there by
   the many turbulent commotions of this world,--O grant, that our faith
   may be sustained by this support--that thou art the governor of the
   world, and that men were not only once created by thee, but are also
   preserved by thy hand, and that thou art also a just judge, so that we
   may duly restrain ourselves; and though we must often have to bear many
   insults, let us yet never fail, until our faith shall become victorious
   over all trials, and until we, having passed through continued
   succession of contests, shall at length reach that celestial rest,
   which Christ thy Son has obtained for us. Amen.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lecture One Hundred and Ninth
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 2:1

   1. I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will
   watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I
   am reproved.

   1. Super speculam meam stabo, et statuam me super arcem, et speculabor
   ad videndum quid loquatur mecum, et quid respondeam ad increpationem
   meam.


   We have seen in the first chapter Habakkuk 1:2-3 that the Prophet said
   in the name of all the faithful. It was indeed a hard struggle, when
   all things were in a perplexed state and no outlet appeared. The
   faithful might have thought that all things happened by chance, that
   there was no divine providence; and even the Prophet uttered complaints
   of this kind. He now begins to recover himself from his perplexities;
   and he ever speaks in the person of the godly, or of the whole Church.
   For what is done by some interpreters, who confine what is said to the
   prophetic office, I do not approve; and it may be easy from the
   contempt to learn, that the Prophet does not speak according to his
   private feeling, but that he represents the feelings of all the godly.
   So then we ought to collect this verse with the complaints, which we
   have before noticed; for the Prophet, finding himself sinking, and as
   it were overwhelmed in the deepest abyss, raises himself up above the
   judgement and reason of men, and comes nearer to God, that he might see
   from on high the things which take place on earth, and not judge
   according to the understanding of his own flesh, but by the light of
   the Holy Spirit. For the tower of which he speaks is patience arising
   from hope. If indeed we would struggle perseveringly to the last, and
   at length obtain the victory over all trials and conflicts, we must
   rise above the world.

   Some understand by tower and citadel the Word of God: and this may in
   some measure be allowed, though not in every respect suitable. If we
   more fully weigh the reason for the metaphor, we shall be at no loss to
   know that the tower is the recess of the mind, where we withdraw
   ourselves from the world; for we find how disposed we are all to
   entertain distrust. When, therefore, we follow our own inclination,
   various temptations immediately lay hold on us; nor can we even for a
   moment exercise hope in God: and many things are also suggested to us,
   which take away and deprive us of all confidence: we become also
   involved in variety of thoughts, for when Satan finds men wandering in
   their imaginations and blending many things together, he so entangles
   them that they cannot by any means come nigh to God. If then we would
   cherish faith in our hearts, we must rise above all these difficulties
   and hindrances. And the Prophet by tower means this, that he extricated
   himself from the thoughts of the flesh; for there would have been no
   end nor termination to his doubts, had he tried to form a judgement
   according to his own understanding; I will stand, he says, on my tower,
   [24] I and I will set myself on the citadel. In short, the sentence
   carries this meaning--that the Prophet renounced the judgement of men,
   and broke through all those snares by which Satan entangles us and
   prevents us to rise above the earth.

   He then adds, I will watch to see what he may say to me, that is, I
   will be there vigilant; for by watching he means vigilance and waiting,
   as though he had said, "Though no hope should soon appear, I shall not
   despond; nor shall I forsake my station; but I shall remain constantly
   in that tower, to which I wish now to ascend: I will watch then to see
   what he may say to me." The reference is evidently to God; for the
   opinion of those is not probable, who apply this "saying" to the
   ministers of Satan. For the Prophet says first, I will see what he may
   say to me,' and then he adds, and what I shall answer.' They who
   explain the words what he may say,' as referring to the wicked who
   might oppose him for the purpose of shaking his faith, overlook the
   words of the Prophet, for he speaks here in the singular number; and as
   there is no name expressed, the Prophet no doubt meant God. But were
   the words capable of admitting this explanation, yet the very drift of
   the argument shows, that the passage has the meaning which I have
   attached to it. For how could the faithful answer the calumnies by
   which their faith was assailed, when the profane opprobriously mocked
   and derided them--how could they satisfactorily disprove such
   blasphemies, did they not first attend to what God might say to them?
   For we cannot confute the devil and his ministers, except we be
   instructed by the word of God. We hence see that the Prophet observes
   the best order in what he states, when he says in the first place, I
   will see what God may say to me;' and in the second place, I shall then
   be taught to answer to my chiding;' [25] that is, "If the wicked deride
   my faith, I shall be able boldly to confute them; for the Lord will
   suggest to me such things as may enable me to give a full answer." We
   now perceive the simple and real meaning of this verse. It remains for
   us to accommodate the doctrine to our own use.

   It must be first observed, that there is no remedy, when such trials as
   those mentioned by the Prophet in the first chapter Habakkuk 1:4-17
   meet us, except we learn to raise up our minds above the world. For if
   we contend with Satan, according to our own view of things, he will a
   hundred times overwhelm us, and we can never be able to resist him. Let
   us therefore know, that here is shown to us the right way of fighting
   with him, when our minds are agitated with unbelief, when doubts
   respecting God's providence creep in, when things are so confused in
   this world as to involve us in darkness, so that no light appears: we
   must bid adieu to our own reason; for all our thoughts are nothing
   worth, when we seek, according to our own reason, to form a judgement.
   Until then the faithful ascend to their tower and stand in their
   citadel, of which the Prophet here speaks, their temptations will drive
   them here and there, and sink them as it were in a bottomless gulf. But
   that we may more fully understand the meaning, we must know, that there
   is here an implied contrast between the tower and the citadel, which
   the Prophet mentions, and a station on earth. As long then as we judge
   according to our own perceptions, we walk on the earth; and while we do
   so, many clouds arise, and Satan scatters ashes in our eyes, and wholly
   darkens our judgement, and thus it happens, that we lie down altogether
   confounded. It is hence wholly necessary, as we have before said, that
   we should tread our reason under foot, and come nigh to God himself.

   We have said, that the tower is the recess of the mind; but how can we
   ascend to it? even by following the word of the Lord. For we creep on
   the earth; nay, we find that our flesh ever draws us downward: except
   then the truth from above becomes to us as it were wings, or a ladder,
   or a vehicle, we cannot rise up one foot; but, on the contrary, we
   shall seek refuges on the earth rather than ascend into heaven. But let
   the word of God become our ladder, or our vehicle, or our wings, and,
   however difficult the ascent may be, we shall yet be able to fly
   upward, provided God's word be allowed to have its own authority. We
   hence see how unsuitable is the view of those interpreters, who think
   that the tower and the citadel is the word of God; for it is by God's
   word, as I have already said, that we are raised up to this citadel,
   that is, to the safeguard of hope; where we may remain safe and secure
   while looking down from this eminence on those things which disturb us
   and darken all our senses as long as we lie on the earth. This is one
   thing.

   Then the repetition is not without its use; for the Prophet says, On my
   tower will I stand, on the citadel will I set myself. He does not
   repeat in other words the same thing, because it is obscure; but in
   order to remind the faithful, that though they are inclined to sloth,
   they must yet strive to extricate themselves. And we soon find how
   slothful we become, except each of us stirs up himself. For when any
   perplexity takes hold on our minds, we soon succumb to despair. This,
   then, is the reason why the Prophet, after having spoken of the tower,
   again mentions the citadel.

   But when he says, I will watch to see, he refers to perseverance; for
   it is not enough to open our eyes once, and by one look to observe what
   happens to us; but it is necessary to continue our attention. This
   constant attention is, then, what the Prophet means by watching; for we
   are not so clear-sighted as immediately to comprehend what is useful to
   be known. And then, though we may once see what is necessary, yet a new
   temptation can obliterate that view. It thus happens, that all our
   observations become evanescent, except we continue to watch, that is,
   except we persevere in our attention, so that we may ever return to
   God, whenever the devil raises new storms, and whenever he darkens the
   heavens with clouds to prevent us to see God. We hence see how
   emphatical is what the Prophet says here, I will watch to see. The
   Prophet evidently compares the faithful to watchmen, who, though they
   hear nothing, yet do not sleep; and if they hear any noise once or
   twice, they do not immediately sound an alarm, but wait and attend. As,
   then, they who keep watch ought to remain quiet, that they may not
   disturb others, and that they may duly perform their office; so it
   behaves the faithful to be also tranquil and quiet, and wait patiently
   for God during times of perplexity and confusion.

   Let us now inquire what is the purpose of this watching: I will watch
   to see, he says, what he may say to me. There seems to be an
   impropriety in the expression; for we do not properly see what is said.
   But the Prophet connects together here two metaphors. To speak strictly
   correct, he ought to have said, "I will continue attentive to hear what
   he may say;" but he says, I will watch to see what he may say. The
   metaphor is found correctly used in Psalm 85:8,

   "I will hear what God may say; for he will speak peace to his people."

   There also it is a metaphor, for the Prophet speaks not of natural
   hearing: "I will hear what God may speak," what does that hearing mean?
   It means this, "I will quietly wait until God shows his favor, which is
   now hid; for he will speak peace to his people;" that is, the Lord will
   never forget his own Church. But the Prophet, as I have said, joins
   together here two metaphors; for to speak, or to say, means no other
   thing than that God testifies to our hearts, that though the reason for
   his purpose does not immediately appear to us, yet all things are
   wisely ruled, and that nothing is better than to submit to his will.
   But when he says, "I will see, and I will watch what he may say," the
   metaphor seems incongruous, and yet there appears a reason for it; for
   the Prophet intended to remind us, that we ought to employ all our
   senses for this end,--to be wholly attentive to God's word. For though
   one may be resolved to hear God, we yet find that many temptations
   immediately distract us. It is not then enough to become teachable, and
   to apply our ears to hear his voice, except also our eyes be connected
   with them, so that we may be altogether attentive.

   We hence see the object of the Prophet; for he meant to express the
   greatest attention, as though he had said, that the faithful would ever
   wander in their thoughts, except they carefully concentrated both their
   eyes and their ears, and all their senses, on God, and continually
   restrained themselves, lest vagrant speculations or imaginations should
   lead them astray. And further, the Prophet teaches us, that we ought to
   have such reverence for God's word as to deem it sufficient for us to
   hear his voice. Let this, then, be our understanding, to obey God
   speaking to us, and reverently to embrace his word, so that he may
   deliver us from all troubles, and also keep our minds in peace and
   tranquillity.

   God's speaking, then, is opposed to all the obstreperous clamours of
   Satan, which he never ceases to sound in our ears. For as soon as any
   temptation takes place, Satan suggests many things to us, and those of
   various kinds:--"What will you do? what advice will you take? see
   whether God is propitious to you from whom you expect help. How can you
   dare to trust that God will assist you? How can he extricate you? What
   will be the issue?" As Satan then disturbs us in various ways, the
   Prophet shows that the word of God alone is sufficient for us all,
   then, who indulge themselves in their own counsels, deserve to be
   forsaken by God, and to be left by him to be driven up and down, and
   here and there, by Satan; for the only unfailing security for the
   faithful is to acquiesce in God's word.

   But this appears still more clear from what is expressed at the close
   of the verse, when the Prophet adds, and what I may answer to the
   reproof given me; for he shows that he would be furnished with the best
   weapons to sustain and repel all assaults, provided he patiently
   attended to God speaking to him, and fully embraced his word: "Then,"
   he says, "I shall have what I may answer to all reproofs, when the Lord
   shall speak to me". By "reproofs," he means not only the blasphemies by
   which the wicked shake his faith, but also all those turbulent feelings
   by which Satan secretly labors to subvert his faith. For not only the
   ungodly deride us and mock at our simplicity, as though we
   presumptuously and foolishly trusted in God, and were thus
   over-credulous; but we also reprove ourselves inwardly, and disturb
   ourselves by various internal contentions; for whatever comes to our
   mind that is in opposition to God's word, is properly a chiding or a
   reproof, as it is the same thing as if one accused himself, as though
   he had not found God to be faithful. We now, then see that the word
   "reproof" extends farther than to those outward blasphemies by which
   the unbelieving are wont to assail the children of God; for, as we have
   already said, though no one attempted to try our faith, yet every one
   is a tempter to himself; for the devil never ceases to agitate our
   minds. When, therefore, the Prophet says, what I may answer to reproof,
   he means, that he would be sufficiently fortified against all the
   assaults of Satan, both secret and external, when he heard what God
   might say to him.

   We may also gather from the whole verse, that we can form no judgement
   of God's providence, except by the light of celestial truth. It is
   hence no wonder that many fall away under trials, yea, almost the whole
   world; for few there are who ascend into the citadel of which the
   Prophet speaks, and who are willing to hear God speaking to them.
   Hence, presumption and arrogance blind the minds of men, so that they
   either speak evil of God who addresses them, or accuse fortune, or
   maintain that there is nothing certain: thus they murmur within
   themselves, and arrogate to themselves more than they ought, and never
   submit to God's word. Let us proceed, -
     __________________________________________________________________

   [24] On my watch-tower, [msmrty]; the word means commonly the office,
   or the act of watching, but here it means evidently the place; the verb
   "stand" and the corresponding word [mtsvr] fortress, or citadel, in the
   next line, prove clearly that this is its meaning here. The metaphor is
   taken from the practice of ascending a high tower, when any messenger
   was expected with news. That any locality is meant here is supported by
   nothing in the passage. The Prophet puts himself in an attitude of
   waiting for an answer from God to the complaints which he had made: and
   the metaphor of "tower and citadel" is most beautifully applied by
   Calvin, and in a very instructive and striking manner. I give this
   version-- On my watch-tower will I stand,
   And I will set myself on a citadel;
   That I may look out to see what he will say to me,
   And what I shall answer to the reproof given to me;
   Literally, to my reproof. --Ed.

   [25] That is, to the chiding, rebuke, or reproof, given to me. Both
   Newcome and Henderson give a version of this line, which is nearly the
   same, but seems incongruous, though Grotius agrees with them. The
   version of the former is as follows:-- And what I should reply to my
   arguing with him.
   The latter renders the line thus: --
   And what I shall reply in regard to my argument. The phrase is,
   [l-tvkchty] upon, (to, says Drusius) my reproof, or rebuke, or chiding.
   This is the current meaning of the word, see 2 Kings 19:3; Proverbs
   10:17; 12:1; Isaiah 37:3. He calls it "my," because given him, either
   by his enemies, as Calvin thinks, or by God, as some others suppose.
   The view of Piscator and Junius is, that it is the reproof or
   correction he administered to the people in chapter 1:2-12. He was
   waiting to know what he might have to give as a reply in defense of
   that reproof. "And what I may reply as to my reproof," i.e., the
   reproof given by him. In this case, the preceding clause, "What he may
   or will say to me," refers to his complaint respecting the Chaldeans.
   This is altogether consistent with the mode in which the Prophets
   usually write: reversing the order, they take up first the last
   subject, and then refer to the first. He then waited to know two
   things, how to solve his difficulties respecting the conduct of the
   Chaldeans, and how to reply to his own people for the severe rebuke he
   gave them. There is much in this view to recommend it.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 2:2, 3

   2. And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it
   plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.

   2. Et respondit mihi Jehova et dixit, Scribe visionem, et explana super
   tabulas, ut currat legens in ea:

   3. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall
   speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will
   surely come, it will not tarry.

   3. Quia adhue visio ad tempus statutum, et loquetur ad finem, et non
   mentietur; si moram fecerit, expecta eam; quia veniendo veniet, et non
   tardabit.


   The Prophet now shows by his own example that there is no fear but that
   God will give help in time, provided we bring our minds to a state of
   spiritual tranquillity, and constantly look up to him: for the event
   which the Prophet relates, proves that there is no danger that God will
   frustrate their hope and patience, who lift up their minds to heaven,
   and continue steadily in that attitude. Answer me, he says, did
   Jehovah, and said. There is no doubt but that the Prophet accommodates
   here his own example to the common instruction of the whole Church.
   Hence, by testifying that an answer was given him by God, he intimates
   that we ought to entertain a cheerful hope, that the Lord, when he
   finds us stationed in our watch-tower, will in due season convey to us
   the consolation which he sees we need.

   But he afterwards comes to the discharge of his prophetic office; for
   he was bid to write the vision on tables, and to write it in large
   letters, that it might be read, and that any one, passing by quickly,
   might be able by one glance to see what was written: and by this second
   part he shows still more clearly that he treated of a common truth,
   which belonged to the whole body of the Church; for it was not for his
   own sake that he was bid to write, but for the edification of all.

   Write, then, the vision, and make it plain; for v'r, bar properly
   means, to declare plainly. [26] Unfold it then, he says, on tables,
   that he may run who reads it; that is, that the writing may not cause
   the readers to stop. Write it in large characters, that any one, in
   running by, may see what is written. Then he adds, for the vision shall
   be for an appointed time

   This is a remarkable passage; for we are taught here that we are not to
   deal with God in too limited a manner, but room must be given for hope;
   for the Lord does not immediately execute what he declares by his
   mouth; but his purpose is to prove our patience, and the obedience of
   our faith. Hence he says, the vision, is for a time, and a fixed time:
   for mvd, muod means a time which has been determined by agreement. But
   as it is God who fore appoints the time, the constituted time, of which
   the Prophet speaks, depends on his will and power. The vision, then,
   shall be for a time. He reproves here that immoderate ardor which takes
   hold on us, when we are anxious that God should immediately accomplish
   what he promises. The Prophet then shows that God so speaks as to be at
   liberty to defer the execution of his promise until it seems good to
   him.

   At the end, he says, it will speak [27] In a word, the Prophet
   intimates, that honor is to be given to God's word, that we ought to be
   fully persuaded that God speaks what is true, and be so satisfied with
   his promises as though what is promised were really possessed by us. At
   the end, then, it will speak and it will not lie [28] Here the Prophet
   means, that fulfillment would take place, so that experience would at
   length prove, that God had not spoken in vain, nor for the sake of
   deceiving; but yet that there was need of patience; for, as it has been
   said, God intends not to indulge our fervid and importunate desires by
   an immediate fulfillment, but his design is to hold us in suspense. And
   this is the true sacrifice of praise, when we restrain ourselves, and
   remain firm in the persuasion that God cannot deceive nor lie, though
   he may seem for a time to trifle with us. It will not, then, lie

   He afterwards adds, If it will delay, wait for it. He again expresses
   still more clearly the true character of faith, that it does not break
   forth immediately into complaints, when God connives at things, when he
   suffers us to be oppressed by the wicked, when he does not immediately
   succor us; in a word, when he does not without delay fulfill what he
   has promised in his word. If, then, it delays, wait for it. He again
   repeats the same thing, coming it will come; that is, however it may
   be, God, who is not only true, but truth itself, will accomplish his
   own promises. The fulfillment, then, of the promise will take place in
   due time.

   But we must notice the contrariety, If it will delay, it will come, it
   will not delay. The two clauses seem to be contrary the one to the
   other. But delay, mentioned first, has a reference to our haste. It is
   a common proverb, "Even quickness is delay to desire." We indeed make
   such haste in all our desires, that the Lord, when he delays one
   moment, seems to be too slow. Thus it may come easily to our mind to
   expostulate with him on the ground of slowness. God, then, is said on
   this account to delay in his promises; and his promises also as to
   their accomplishment may be said to be delayed. But if we have regard
   to the counsel of God, there is never any delay; for he knows all the
   points of time, and in slowness itself he always hastens, however this
   may be not comprehended by the flesh. We now, then, apprehend what the
   Prophet means. [29]

   He is now bidden to write the vision, and to explain it on tables. Many
   confine this to the coming of Christ; but I rather think that the
   Prophet ascribes the name of vision to the doctrine or admonition,
   which he immediately subjoins. It is indeed true, that the faithful
   under the law could not have cherished hope in God without having their
   eyes and their minds directed to Christ: but it is one thing to take a
   passage in a restricted sense as applying to Christ himself, and
   another thing to set forth those promises which refer to the
   preservation of the Church. As far then as the promises of God in
   Christ are yea and amen, no vision could have been given to the
   Fathers, which could have raised their minds, and supported them in the
   hope of salvation, without Christ having been brought before them. But
   the Prophet here intimates generally, that a command was given to him
   to supply the hearts of the godly with this support, that they were, as
   we shall hereafter more clearly see, to wait for God. The vision, then,
   is nothing else than an admonition, which will be found in the next and
   the following verses.

   He uses two words, to write and to explain; which some pervert rather
   than rightly distinguish: for as the Prophets were wont to write, and
   also to set forth the summaries or the heads of their discourses, they
   think that it was a command to Habakkuk to write, that he might leave
   on record to posterity what he had said; and then to publish what he
   taught as an edict, that it might be seen by the people passing by, not
   only for a day or for a few days. But I do not think that the Prophet
   speaks with so much refinement: I therefore consider that to write and
   to explain on tables mean the same thing. And what is added, that he
   may run who reads it, is to be understood as I have already explained
   it; for God intended to set forth this declaration as memorable and
   worthy of special notice. It was not usual with the Prophets to write
   in long and large characters; but the Prophet mentions here something
   peculiar, because the declaration was worthy of being especially
   observed. What is similar to this is said in Isaiah 8:1, Write on a
   table with a man's pen.' By a man's pen is to be understood common
   writing, such as is comprehended by the rudest and the most ignorant.
   To the same purpose is what God bids here his servant Habakkuk to do.
   Write, he says how? Not as Prophecies are wont to be written, for the
   Prophets set before the people the heads of their discourses; but
   write, he says, so that he who runs may read, and that though he may be
   inattentive, he may yet see what is written; for the table itself will
   plainly show what it contains.

   We now see that the Prophet commends, by a peculiar eulogy, what he
   immediately subjoins. Hence this passage ought to awaken all our
   powers, as God himself testifies that he announces what is worthy of
   being remembered: for he speaks not of a common truth; but his purpose
   was to reveal something great and unusually excellent; as he bids it,
   as I have already said, to be written in large characters, so that
   those who run might read it.

   And by saying that the vision is yet for a time, he shows, as I have
   briefly explained, what great reverence is due to heavenly truth. For
   to wish God to conform to our rule is extremely preposterous and
   unreasonable: and there is no place for faith, if we expect God to
   fulfill immediately what he promises. It is hence the trial of faith to
   acquiesce in God's word, when its accomplishment does in no way appear.
   As then the Prophet teaches us, that the vision is yet for a time, he
   reminds us that we have no faith, except we are satisfied with God's
   word alone, and suspend our desires until the seasonable time comes,
   that which God himself has appointed. The vision, then, yet shall be.
   But we are inclined to reduce, as it were, to nothing the power of God,
   except he accomplishes what he has said: "Yet, yet," says the Prophet,
   "the vision shall be;" that is, "Though God does not stretch forth his
   hand, still let what he has spoken be sufficient for you: let then the
   vision itself be enough for you; let it be deemed worthy of credit, so
   that the word of God may on its own account be believed; and let it not
   be tried according to the common rule; for men charge God with
   falsehood, except he immediately yields to their desires. Let then the
   vision itself be counted sufficiently solid and firm, until the
   suitable time shall come." And the word mvd, muod, ought to be noticed;
   for the Prophet does not speak simply of time, but, as I have already
   said, he points out a certain and a preordained time. When men make an
   agreement, they on both sides fix the day: but it would be the highest
   presumption in us to require that God should appoint the day according
   to our will. It belongs, then, to him to appoint the times, and so to
   govern all things, that we may approve of whatever he does.

   He afterwards says, And it will speak at the end, and it will not lie.
   The same is the import of the expression, it will speak at the end;
   that is, men are very perverse, if they wish God to close his mouth,
   and if they wish to deny faith to his word, except he instantly fulfill
   what he speaks. It will then speak; that is, let this liberty of
   speaking be allowed to God. And there is always an implied contrast
   between the voice of God and its accomplishment; for we are to
   acquiesce in God's word, though he may conceal his hand: though he may
   afford no proof of his power, yet the Prophet commands this honor to be
   given to his word. The vision, then, will speak at the end

   He now expresses more clearly what he had before said of the
   preordained time; and thus he meets the objections which Satan is wont
   to suggest to us: "How long will that time be delayed? Thou indeed
   namest it as the preordained time; but when will that day come?" "The
   Lord," he says, "will speak at the end;" that is, "Though the Lord
   protracts time, and though day after day we seem to live on vain
   promises, yet let God speak, that is, let him have this honor from you,
   and be ye persuaded that he is true, that he cannot disappoint you; and
   in the meantime wait for his power; wait, so that ye may yet remain
   quiet, resting on his word, and let all your thoughts be confined
   within this stronghold--that it is enough that God has spoken. The rest
   we shall defer until to-morrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [26] The word means, to open, or make open. It was to be written in
   open and plain letters, and on tables or tablets. These were either of
   wood or stone, made smooth. The Septuagint render the word puxion, a
   smooth plank of boxwood, and give the whole sentence thus: "Write the
   vision and openly (or plainly--saphos,) on boxwood." See Deuteronomy
   27:8. So Junius takes the word as an adverb, perspicue,
   perspicuously.--Ed.

   [27] It is not a common word that is used: [yphch], "it will breathe."
   When transitively, it signifies, to breathe out or forth, and is
   rendered often in our version, to speak; see Proverbs 6:19; 12:17. The
   idea here seems to be the restoration, as it were, of a suspended life.
   The vision was to be for a time like a body without any symptom of
   life: but "it will breathe," he says, "at last," or at the end; that
   is, it will live, and manifest life and vigor. This breathing, or this
   life, would be its accomplishment. Corresponding with this idea is
   anateli, "it will rise," by the Septuagint.--Ed.

   [28] [kzv], its primary meaning, is to fail, Isaiah 63:11; and to fail,
   in a moral sense, is to lie, and also to deceive; and the latter
   meaning is attached to it here by Drusius, Piscator, and Grotius, non
   fallet, it will not deceive, i.e., disappoint.--Ed.

   [29] What is here said is very true; but the words are not the same in
   Hebrew. The first signifies delay, [ytmhmh] rendered "linger" in
   Genesis 19:16; 43:10. The other verb, [y'chr], means, to put off, to
   postpone: and the sense is, that the vision will not be after the
   appointed time. So the two lines may be thus rendered: If it will
   delay, wait for it,
   For coming it will come, it will not be postponed; or, be after, i.e.,
   the appointed time. Dr. Wheeler, quoted by Newcome, gives the right
   idea, by the following paraphrase: It shall not be later than its
   season. Both Jerome and Marckius have found a grammatical difficulty in
   this verse from a mistake as to the gender of [chzvn], vision; and they
   had been evidently led astray by the Septuagint; in which the gender is
   changed, and the phrase, "wait for it," is rendered, "wait for him,"
   hupomeinon auton; and so as to what follows, "for he that cometh
   (erchomenos) shall come." But [chzvn] is the masculine gender; it is
   elsewhere connected with verbs in that gender. See 1 Samuel 3:1;
   Ezekiel 12:22. Indeed the whole tenor of the passage admits not of any
   other construction. It is probable that this mistake made Eusebius and
   Augustine to apply this verse to Christ, and some to Nebuchadnezzar, in
   a typical sense.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou sees us laboring under so much
   weakness, yea, with our minds so blinded that our faith falters at the
   smallest perplexities, and almost fails altogether,--O grant that by
   the power of thy Spirit we may be raised up above this world, and learn
   more and more to renounce our own counsels, and so to come to thee,
   that we may stand fixed in our watch tower, ever hoping, through thy
   power, for whatever thou hast promised to us, though thou shouldst not
   immediately make it manifest to us that thou hast faithfully spoken;
   and may we thus give full proof of our faith and patience, and proceed
   in the course of our warfare, until at length we ascend, above all
   watch towers, into that blessed rest, where we shall no more watch with
   an attentive mind, but see, face to face, in thine image, whatever can
   be wished, and whatever is needful for our perfect happiness, through
   Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Tenth

   The Prophet taught us yesterday, that we ought to allow God his right
   of speaking to us, and of sustaining us by his own word, until the ripe
   time shall come, when he shall really fulfill what he has promised.
   Then an exhortation follows, added at the close of the verse--that we
   are to exercise patience; and the Apostle also, referring to this
   passage in Hebrews 10:38, makes a similar application. He indeed quotes
   what we shall find in the next verse, The just by his faith shall
   live;' but he had in view the whole context; and at the same time he
   reminds us of the Prophet's object here in exalting the authority of
   God's word. The exhortation, then, is briefly this--that though God may
   keep us in suspense, we yet ought not to cast away hope, for he knows
   when it is expedient for us that he should stretch forth his hand. And
   as there are two clauses, as I said yesterday, which seem at first
   sight to be inconsistent the one with the other, the Prophet very fitly
   joins them together, and considers them to be in perfect harmony; for
   though God may appear to delay, yet he is not slower than what is
   necessary and expedient. Let us then be fully persuaded that there is
   in God prudence and wisdom enough to assist us as soon as it may be
   needful. The Prophet now reminds us that it is no wonder if God seems
   to us to delay, for we are too hasty in our desires. Let therefore this
   fervor be restrained, so that we may subject our feelings to the
   providence and purpose of God. Let us now proceed--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 2:4

   4. Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the
   just shall live by his faith.

   4. Ecce exaltatio, (vel, qui se munit, ut alii vertunt,) non recta est
   anima ejus in ipso: justus autem in fide sua vivet.


   This verse stands connected with the last, for the Prophet means to
   show that nothing is better than to rely on God's word, how much soever
   may various temptations assault our souls. We hence see that nothing
   new is said here, but that the former doctrine is confirmed--that our
   salvation is rendered safe and certain through God's promise alone, and
   that therefore we ought not to seek any other haven, where we might
   securely sustain all the onsets of Satan and of the world. But he sets
   the two clauses the one opposed to the other: every man who would
   fortify himself would ever be subject to various changes, and never
   attain a quiet mind; then comes the other clause--that man cannot
   otherwise obtain rest than by faith.

   But the former part is variously explained. Some interpreters think the
   word phlh, ophle, to be a noun, and render it elevation, which is not
   unsuitable; and indeed I hesitate not to regard this as its real
   meaning, for the Hebrews call a citadel vphl, ouphel, rightly deriving
   it from phl, ophle, to ascend. What some others maintain, that it
   signifies to strengthen, is not well founded. Some again give this
   explanation--that the unbelieving seek a stronghold for themselves,
   that they may fortify themselves; and this makes but little difference
   as to the thing itself. But interpreters vary, and differ as to the
   meaning of the sentence; for some substitute the predicate for the
   subject, and the subject for the predicate, and elicit this meaning
   from the Prophet's words--"Every one whose mind is not at ease seeks a
   fortress, where he may safely rest and strengthens himself;" and others
   give this view--"He who is proud, or who thinks himself well fortified,
   shall ever be of an unquiet mind." And this latter meaning is what I
   approve, only that I retain the import of the word phlh, ophle, as
   though it was said--"where there is an elation of mind there is no
   tranquillity."

   Let us see first what their view is who give the other explanation.
   They say that the unbelieving, being obstinate and perverted in their
   minds, ever seek where they may be in safety, for they are full of
   suspicions, and having no regard to God they resort to the world for
   those remedies, by which they may escape evils and dangers. This is
   their view. But the Prophet, as I have already said, does here, on the
   contrary, denounce punishment on the unbelieving, as though he had
   said--"This reward, which they have deserved, shall be repaid to
   them--that they shall always torment themselves." The contrast will
   thus be more obvious; and when we say that God punishes the
   unbelieving, when he suffers them to be driven here and there, and also
   harasses their minds with various tormenting thoughts, a more fruitful
   doctrine is elicited. When therefore the Prophet says that there is no
   calmness of mind possessed by those who deem themselves well fortified,
   he intimates that they are their own executioners, for they seek for
   themselves many troubles, many sorrows, many anxieties, and contrive
   and mingle together many designs and purposes; now they think of one
   thing, then they turn to another; for the Hebrews say that the soul is
   made right when we acquiesce in a thing and continue in a tranquil
   state of mind; but when confused thoughts distract us, then they say
   that our soul is not right in us. We now perceive the real meaning of
   the Prophet.

   Behold, he says: by this demonstrative particle he intimates that what
   he teaches us may be clearly seen if we attend to daily events. The
   meaning then is, that a proof of this fact exists evidently in the
   common life of men--that he who fortifies himself, and is also elated
   with self confidence, never finds a tranquil haven, for some new
   suspicion or fear ever disturbs his mind. Hence it comes that the soul
   entangles itself in various cares and anxieties. This is the reward, as
   I have said, which is allotted by God's just judgement to the
   unbelieving; for God, as he testifies by Isaiah, offers to us rest; and
   they who reject this invaluable benefit, freely offered to them by God,
   deserve that they should not only be tormented in one way, but be also
   harassed by endless agitations, and that they should also vex and
   torment themselves. It is indeed true that he who is fortified may also
   acquiesce in God's word; but the word phlh, ophle, refers to the state
   of the mind. Whosoever, then, swells with vain confidence, when he
   finds that he has many auxiliaries according to the flesh, shall ever
   be agitated, and will at length find that there is nowhere rest, except
   the mind recumbs on God's grace alone. We now understand the import of
   this clause. [30]

   It follows, but the just shall live by his faith. The Prophet, I have
   no doubt, does here place faith in opposition to all those defences by
   which men so blind themselves as to neglect God, and to seek no aid
   from him. As men therefore rely on what the earth affords, depending on
   their fallacious supports, the Prophet here ascribes life to faith. But
   faith, as it is well known, and as we shall presently show more at
   large, depends on God alone. That we may then live by faith, the
   Prophet intimates that we must willingly give up all those defences
   which are wont to disappoint us. He then who finds that he is deprived
   of all protections, will live by his faith, provided he seeks in God
   alone what he wants, and leaving the world, fixes his mind on heaven.

   As 'mvgt, amunat, is in Hebrew truth, so some regard it as meaning
   integrity; as though the Prophet had said, that the just man has more
   safety in his faithfulness and pure conscience, than there is to the
   children of this world in all those munitions in which they glory. But
   in this case they frigidly extenuate the Prophet's declaration; for
   they understand not what that righteousness of faith is from which our
   salvation proceeds. It is indeed certain that the Prophet understands
   by the word 'mvgt, amunat, that faith which strips us of all arrogance,
   and leads us naked and needy to God, that we may seek salvation from
   him alone, which would otherwise be far removed from us.

   Now many confine the first part to Nebuchadnezzar, but this is not
   suitable. The Prophet indeed speaks to the end of the chapter of
   Babylon and its ruin; but here he makes a distinction between the
   children of God, who cast all their cares on him, and the unbelieving,
   who cannot go forth beyond the world, where they seek to be made
   secure, and gather hence their defences in which they confide. And this
   is especially worthy of being observed, for it helps us much to
   understand the meaning of the Prophet; if this part--"Behold the proud,
   his soul is not right in him," be applied to Nebuchadnezzar, the other
   part will lose much of its import; but if we consider that the Prophet,
   as it were, in these two tablets, shows what it is to glory in our own
   powers or in earthly aids, then what it is to repose on God alone will
   appear much more clear, and this truth will with more force penetrate
   into our minds; for we know how much such comparisons illustrate a
   subject which would be otherwise obscure or less evident. For if the
   Prophet had only declared that our faith is the cause of life and
   salvation, it might indeed be understood; but as we are disposed to
   entertain worldly hopes, the former truth would not have been
   sufficient to correct this evil, and to free our minds from all vain
   confidence. But when he affirms that all the unbelieving are deceived,
   while they fortify or elate themselves, because God will ever confound
   them, and that though no one disturbs them outwardly, they will yet be
   their own tormentors, as they have nothing that is right, nothing that
   is certain; when therefore all this is said to us, it is as though God
   drew us forcibly to himself, while seeing us deluded by the allurements
   of Satan, and seeing us too inclined to be taken with deceptions, which
   would at length lead us to destruction.

   We now, then, perceive why Habakkuk has put these two things in
   opposition the one to the other--that the defences of this world are
   not only evanescent, but also bring always with them many tormenting
   fears--and then, that the just lives by his faith. And hence also is
   found a confirmation of what I have already touched upon, that faith is
   not to be taken here for man's integrity, but for that faith which sets
   man before God emptied of all good things, so that he seeks what he
   needs from his gratuitous goodness: for all the unbelieving try to
   fortify themselves; and thus they strengthen themselves, thinking that
   anything in which they trust is sufficient for them. But what does the
   just do? He brings nothing before God except faith: then he brings
   nothing of his own, because faith borrows, as it were, through favor,
   what is not in man's possession. He, then, who lives by faith, has no
   life in himself; but because he wants it, he flies for it to God alone.
   The Prophet also puts the verb in the future tense, in order to show
   the perpetuity of this life: for the unbelieving glory in a shadowy
   life; but the Lord will at last discover their folly, and they
   themselves shall really know that they have been deceived. But as God
   never disappoints the hope of his people, the Prophet promises here a
   perpetual life to the faithful.

   Let us now come to Paul, who has applied the Prophet's testimony for
   the purpose of teaching us that salvation is not by works, but by the
   mercy of God alone, and therefore by faith. Paul seems to have
   misapplied the Prophet's words, and to have used them beyond what they
   import; for the Prophet speaks here of the state of the present life,
   and he has not previously spoken of the celestial life, but exhorted,
   as we have seen, the faithful to patience, and at the same time
   testified that God would be their deliverer; and now he adds, the just
   shall live by faith, though he may be destitute of all help, and though
   he may be exposed to all the assaults of fortune, and of the wicked,
   and of the devil. What has this to do, some one may say, with the
   eternal salvation of the soul? It seems, then, that Paul has with too
   much refinement introduced this testimony into his discussion
   respecting gratuitous justification by faith. But this principle ought
   ever to be remembered--that whatever benefits the Lord confers on the
   faithful in this life, are intended to confirm them in the hope of the
   eternal inheritance; for however liberally God may deal with us, our
   condition would yet be indeed miserable, were our hope confined to this
   earthly life. As God then would raise up our minds to the hopes of
   eternal salvation whenever he aids us in this world, and declares
   himself to be our Father; hence, when the Prophet says that the
   faithful shall live, he certainly does not confine this life to so
   narrow limits, that God will only defend us for a day or two, or for a
   few years; but he proceeds much farther, and says, that we shall be
   made really and truly happy; for though this whole world may perish or
   be exposed to various changes, yet the faithful shall continue in
   permanent and real safety. Hence, when Habakkuk promises life in future
   to the faithful, he no doubt overleaps the boundaries of this world,
   and sets before the faithful a better life than that which they have
   here, which is accompanied with many sorrows, and proves itself by its
   shortness to be unworthy of being much desired.

   We now perceive that Paul wisely and suitably accommodates to his
   subject the Prophet's words--that the just lives by faith; for there is
   no salvation for the soul except through God's mercy.

   Quoting this place in Romans 1:17, he says that the righteousness of
   God is in the gospel revealed from faith to faith, and then adds,

   "As it is written, The just shall live by faith."

   Paul very rightly connects these things together that righteousness is
   made known in the Gospel--and that it comes to us by faith only; for he
   there contends that men cannot obtain righteousness by the law, or by
   the works of the law; it follows that it is revealed in the Gospel
   alone: how does he prove this? By the testimony of the Prophet
   Habakkuk--

   "If by faith the just lives, then he is just by faith; if he is just by
   faith, then he is not so by the works of the law."

   And Paul assumes this principle, to which I have before referred--that
   men are emptied of all works, when they produce their faith before God:
   for as long as man possesses anything of his own, he does not please
   God by faith alone, but also by his own worthiness.

   If then faith alone obtains grace, the law must necessarily be
   relinquished, as the apostle also explains more clearly in the third
   chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians Galatians 3:11:

   That righteousness,' he says, is not by the works of the law, is
   evident; for it is written, The just shall live by faith, and the law
   is not of faith.'

   Paul assumes that these, even faith and law, are contrary, the one to
   the other; contrary as to the work of justifying. The law indeed agrees
   with the gospel; nay, it contains in itself the gospel. And Paul has
   solved this question in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans,
   Romans 1:1-32 by saying, that the law cannot assist us to attain
   righteousness, but that it is offered to us in the gospel, and that it
   receives a testimony from the law and the Prophets. Though then there
   is a complete concord between the law and the gospel, as God, who is
   not inconsistent with himself, is the author of both; yet as to
   justification, the law accords not with the gospel, any more than light
   with darkness: for the law promises life to those who serve God; and
   the promise is conditional, dependent on the merits of works. The
   gospel also does indeed promise righteousness under condition; but it
   has no respect to the merits of works. What then? It is only this, that
   they who are condemned and lost are to embrace the favor offered to
   them in Christ.

   We now then see how, by the testimony of our Prophet, Paul rightly
   confirms his own doctrine, that eternal salvation is to be attained by
   faith only; for we are destitute of all merits by works, and are
   constrained to stand naked and needy before God; and then the Lord
   justifies us freely.

   But that this may be more evident, let us first consider why men must
   come altogether naked before God; for were there any worthiness in
   them, the Lord would by no means deprive them of such an honor. Why
   then does the Lord justify us freely, except that he may thereby appear
   just? He has indeed no need of this glory, as though he could not
   himself be glorified except by doing wrong to men. But we obtain
   righteousness by faith alone for this reason, because God finds nothing
   in us which he can approve, or what may avail to obtain righteousness.
   Since it is so, we then see that to be true which the Holy Spirit
   everywhere declares respecting the character of men. Men indeed glory
   in a foolish conceit as to their own righteousness: but all philosophic
   virtues, as they call them, which men think they possess through
   free-will, are mere fumes; nay, they are the delusions of the devil, by
   which he bewitches the minds of men, so that they come not to God, but,
   on the contrary, precipitate themselves into the lowest deep, where
   they seek to exalt themselves beyond measure. However this may be, let
   us be fully convinced, that in man there is not even a particle either
   of rectitude or of righteousness; and that whatever men may try to do
   of themselves, is an abomination before God. This is one thing.

   Now after God has stretched forth his hand to his elect, it is still
   necessary that they should confess their own want and nakedness, as to
   justification; for though they have been regenerated by the Spirit of
   God, yet in many things they are deficient, and thus in innumerable
   ways they become exposed to eternal death in the sight of God; so that
   they have in themselves no righteousness. The Papists differ from us in
   the first place, imagining as they do, that there are certain
   preparations necessary; for that false notion about free-will cannot be
   eradicated from their hearts. As then they will have man to be endued
   with free- will, they always connect with it some power, as though they
   could obtain grace by their own doings. They indeed confess that man of
   himself can do nothing, except by the helping grace of God; but in the
   meantime they blend, as I have said, their own fictitious preparations.
   Others confess, that until God anticipates us by his grace, there is no
   power whatever in free-will; but afterwards they suppose that free-will
   concurs with God's grace, as it would be by itself inefficient, except
   received by our consent. Thus they always reserve for men some
   worthiness; but a greater difference exists as to the second subject:
   for after we have been regenerated through God's grace, the Papists
   imagine that we are justified by the merits of works. They confess,
   that until God anticipates us by his grace, we are condemned and cannot
   attain salvation except through the assisting grace of God; but as soon
   as God works in us, we are then, they say, able to attain righteousness
   by our own works.

   But we object and say, that the faithful, after having been regenerated
   by the Spirit of God, do not fulfill the law: they allow this to be
   true, but say that they might if they would, for that God has commanded
   nothing which is above what men are capable of doing. And this also is
   a most pernicious error. They are at the same time forced to confess,
   that experience itself teaches us that no man is wholly free from sin:
   then some guilt always remains. But they say, that if we kept half the
   law, we could obtain righteousness by that half. Hence, if one by
   adultery offended God and thus becomes exposed to eternal death, and
   yet abstains from theft, he is just, they say, because he is no thief.
   He is an adulterer, it is true; but he is yet just in part, because he
   keeps a part of the law; and they call this partial righteousness. But
   God has not promised salvation to men, except they fully and really
   fulfill whatever he has commanded in his law. For it is not said, "He
   that fulfill a part of the law shall live;" but he who shall do these
   things shall live in them. Moses does not point out two or three
   commandments, but includes the whole law (Leviticus 18:5.) There is
   also a declaration made by James,

   He who has forbidden to commit adultery, has also forbidden to steal:
   whosoever then transgresses the law in one particular, is a
   transgressor of the whole law' (James 2:8,11):

   he is then excluded from any hope of righteousness. We hence see that
   the papists are most grossly mistaken, who imagine, that men, when they
   keep the law only in part, are just.

   Were there indeed any one found who strictly kept God's law, he could
   not be counted just, except by virtue of a promise. And here also the
   Papists stumble, and are at the same time inconsistent with themselves;
   for they confess that merits do not obtain righteousness for men by
   their own intrinsic worth, but only by the covenant of the law. But as
   soon as they have said this, they immediately forget themselves, and
   say what is contrary, like men carried away by passion. Were then the
   Papists to join together these two things--that there is no
   righteousness except by covenant, and that there is a partial
   righteousness they would see that they are inconsistent: for where is
   this partial righteousness? If we are not righteous except according to
   the covenant of the law, then we are not righteous except through a
   full and perfect observance of the law. This is certain.

   They go astray still more grievously as to the remission of sins; for
   as it is well known, they obtrude their own satisfactions, and thus
   seek to expiate the sins of men by their own merits, as though the
   sacrifice of Christ was not sufficient for that purpose. Hence it is
   that they will not allow that we are gratuitously justified by faith;
   for they cannot be brought to acknowledge a free remission of sins; and
   except the remission of sins be gratuitous, we must confess that
   righteousness is not by faith alone, but also by merits. But the whole
   Scripture proves that expiation is nowhere else to be sought, except
   through the sacrifice of Christ alone. This error, then, of the Papists
   is extremely gross and false. They further err in pleading for the
   merits of works; for they boast of their own inventions, the works of
   supererogation, or as they call them, satisfactions. And these
   meritorious works, under the Papacy, are gross errors and worthless
   superstitions, and yet they toil in them and lacerate themselves, nay,
   they almost wear out themselves. If they mutter many short prayers, if
   they run to altars and to various churches, if they buy masses, in a
   word, if they accumulate all these fictitious acts of worship, they
   think that they merit righteousness before God. Thus they forget their
   own saying, that righteousness is by covenant; for if it be by
   covenant, it is certain that God does not promise it to fictitious
   works, which men of themselves invent and contrive. It then follows,
   that what men bring to God, devised by themselves, cannot do anything
   towards the attainment of righteousness.

   There is also another error which must be noticed, for in good works
   they perceive not those blemishes which justly displease God, so that
   our works might be deservedly condemned were they strictly examined and
   tried. The Papists rightly say, that we are not justified by the
   intrinsic worthiness of works, but afterwards they do not consider how
   imperfect our works are, for no work proceeds from mortal man which can
   fully answer to what God's covenant requires. How so? For no work
   proceeds from the perfect love of God, and where the perfect love of
   God does not exist, there is corruption there. It hence follows, that
   all our works are polluted before God; for they flow not except from
   the impure fountain of the heart. Were any to object and say, that the
   hearts of men are cleansed by the regeneration of the Spirit, we allow
   this; but at the same time much filth always remains in our hearts, and
   it ought to be sufficient for us to know that nothing is pure and
   genuine before God except where the perfect love of him exists.

   As, then, the Papists are blind to all these things, it is no wonder
   that they with so much hostility contend with us about righteousness,
   and can by no means allow that the righteousness of faith is
   gratuitous, for from the beginning this figment about free- will has
   been resorted to--"if men of themselves come to God, then they are not
   freely justified." They, then, as I have said, imagine a partial
   righteousness, they suppose the deficiency to be made up by
   satisfactions, they have also, as they say, their devotions, that is,
   their own contrived modes of worship. Thus it comes, that they ever
   persuade themselves that the righteousness of man, at least in part, is
   made up by himself or by works. They indeed allow that we are justified
   by faith, but when it is added, by faith alone, then they begin to be
   furious; but they consider not that righteousness, if obtained by
   faith, cannot be by works, for Paul, as I have shown above, reasons
   from the contrary, when he says, that righteousness, if it be by the
   works of the law, is not by faith, for faith, as it has been said,
   strips man of everything, that he may seek of God what he needs. But
   the Papists, though they think that man has not enough for himself, do
   not yet acknowledge that he is so needy and miserable, that
   righteousness must be sought in God alone. But yet sufficiently clear
   is the doctrine of Paul, and if Paul had never spoken, reason itself is
   sufficient to convince us that men cannot be justified by faith until
   they cast away every confidence in their own works, for if
   righteousness be of faith, then it is of grace alone, and if by grace
   alone, then it cannot be by works. It is wholly puerile in the Papists
   to think, that it is partly by grace and partly by the merits of works;
   for as salvation cannot be divided, so righteousness cannot be divided,
   by which we attain salvation itself. As, then, faith acquires for us
   favor before God, and by this favor we are counted just, so all works
   must necessarily fall to the ground, when righteousness is ascribed to
   faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [30] Most authors agree in the main with Calvin in his exposition of
   this clause. The whole verse is quoted by Paul in Hebrews 10:39, nearly
   verbatim from the Scriptures; only he inverts the clauses, and leaves
   out the pronoun, "my," connected with "faith." But this clause, as
   quoted by him, is materially different from the Hebrew text, as it now
   exists, though the chief difference relates to the word [phlh],
   rendered elation, or pride, by Calvin and many others. Two MSS. give
   another reading; one has [vlphh], and the other, [lphh], which means to
   swoon, or to faint, or to fail. This reading would essentially
   harmonize the passage, and the context evidently favors it, as well as
   the antithesis in the verse itself. As to the rest of the clause the
   meaning is same with the Septuagint version, as cited by Paul, though
   the words are different; and there are other examples in which the
   apostle did not alter that version, though varying in words, when the
   sense was preserved. To say that man's soul is not right in him amounts
   to the same thing as to say that God is not pleased with him. There is
   indeed one MS. which has [nphsy], "my soul," and not "his soul;" and
   then [ysrh] is often rendered areskein, to please, by the Septuagint.
   See Numbers 23:27; 2 Chronicles 30:4. There would in this case be a
   complete identity of words as well as of meaning. What especially
   countenances these readings is, that the alteration would agree better
   with the preceding verse. There is an exhortation to wait for the
   vision, i.e., its fulfillment. To refer to pride in this connection
   seems not suitable; but to mention fainting or failing through unbelief
   is quite appropriate; and then as a contrast to this state of mind, the
   latter clause is added. Adopting the main alteration, [lphh] instead of
   [phlh], (only a transposition of two letters,) I would render the verse
   thus-- Behold the fainting! not right is his soul within him;
   But the righteous, by his faith shall he live. The word for "fainting"
   is in the feminine gender, either on account of the word "soul" in what
   follows, or ['ys] is understood, the "man of fainting," instances of
   which are adduced by Henderson on this verse, though he retains the
   word of the present text; as ['ny tphlh], "I am prayer," instead of "I
   am a man of prayer."--Psalms 109:4; see Jeremiah 50:31, 32; Daniel 9:23
   Now not only the antithesis is here complete, but the order also in
   which it occurs corresponds with what is often the style of the
   Prophets; the first part of the first clause corresponds with the last
   part of the second, and the last of the former with the first of the
   latter; and not according to Dr. Henderson, who represents the clauses
   as regularly antithetic. See a similar instance in chapter 1:13, and
   also in the first verse of this chapter. The man who faints, and he who
   lives by faith, form the contrast; and the addition "by faith" in the
   latter clause implies the fainting to be through want of faith, or
   through unbelief. Then the soul that is not right stands in contrast
   with the righteous, or the just in the second line. Thus every thing in
   the verse itself, and in its connection with what precedes it, is in
   favor of what has been proposed. And Grotius and Newcome seemed
   disposed to adopt this reading.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as the corruption of our flesh ever leads us
   to pride and vain confidence, we may be illuminated by thy word, so as
   to understand how great and how grievous is our poverty, and be thus
   taught wholly to deny ourselves, and so to present ourselves naked
   before thee, that we may not hope for righteousness or for salvation
   from any other source than from thy mercy alone, nor seek any rest but
   only in Christ; and may we cleave to thee by the sacred and inviolable
   bond of faith, that we may boldly despise all those empty boastings by
   which the ungodly exult over us, and that we may also so cast ourselves
   down in true humility, that thereby we may be carried upward above all
   heavens, and become partakers of that eternal life which thine only
   begotten Son has purchased for us by his own blood. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Eleventh

   We yesterday compared this passage of Habakkuk with the interpretation
   of Paul, who draws this inference, that we are justified by faith
   without the works of the law, because the Prophet teaches us that we
   are to live by faith, for the way of life and of righteousness is the
   same, inasmuch as life is not to be otherwise sought by us than through
   the paternal favor of God. This then is our life--to be united to God;
   but this union with God cannot be hoped for by us while he imputes sins
   to us; for as he is just and cannot deny himself, iniquity must be ever
   hated by him. Then as long as he regards us as sinners, he must
   necessarily hold us as hateful to him. Where the hatred of God is,
   there is death and ruin. It then follows, that we can have no hope of
   life until we be reconciled to God, and there is no other way by which
   God can restore us to favor, but by regarding and counting us as just.
   It hence follows, that Paul reasons correctly, when he leads us from
   life to righteousness; for they are two things which are connected and
   inseparable.

   Hence the error of the Papists comes to light, who think that to be
   justified is nothing else but to be renewed in righteousness, in order
   that we may lead a pious and a holy life. Hence their righteousness is
   a quality. But Paul's view is very different, for he connects our
   justification and salvation together, inasmuch as God cannot be
   propitious to us without being reconciled to us. And how is this done
   even by not imputing to us our sins. Hence they speak correctly and
   truly express what the Holy Spirit everywhere teaches us, who call it
   imputative righteousness, for they thus show that it is not a quality,
   but, on the contrary, a relative righteousness, and therefore we said
   yesterday that he who lives by faith derives life from another, and
   that every one who is just by faith, is just through what is not in
   himself, even through the gratuitous mercy of God.

   We now then see how suitably Paul joins righteousness with life, and
   adduces the Prophet's testimony to prove gratuitous justification, who
   affirms that we are to live by faith. But it is no wonder that the
   Papists go in so many ways astray in this instance, for they even
   differ with us in the meaning of the word faith. Hence it is that they
   so obstinately deny that we are justified by faith alone. They are
   forced, as we have said yesterday, to admit the righteousness of faith;
   but the exclusive particle they cannot endure; for they imagine that it
   is a moulded faith that justifies, and this moulded or formed faith is
   piety, or the fear of God. And by calling faith unformed they seem to
   think that we can embrace the promises of God without the fruit of
   regeneration, which is very absurd, as though faith were not the
   peculiar gift of the Spirit, and a pledge of our adoption. But these
   are principles of which the Papists are wholly ignorant; for they are
   given up to a reprobate mind, so that they stumble at the very first
   elements of religion.

   But it is sufficient for us, in order to understand this passage, to
   know that we live by faith; for our life is a shadow or a passing
   cloud; and hence our only remedy is to seek life from God alone. And
   how does God communicate this life to us? even by gratuitous promises
   which we embrace by faith; hence salvation is by faith. Now, salvation
   cannot be ascribed to faith and to works too; for faith refers the
   praise for life and salvation to God alone, and works show that
   something is due to man. Faith, then, as to justification, entirely
   excludes all works, so that they come to no account before God; and
   hence I have said that salvation is by faith; for we are accepted of
   God by gratuitous remission of sins. The union of God with us is true
   and real salvation; but no one can be united to God without
   righteousness, and there is found in us no righteousness; hence God
   himself freely imputes it to us; and as we are justified freely, so our
   salvation is said to be gratuitous.

   I will not now repeat what may be said of justification by faith; for
   it is better to proceed with the Prophet's subject, only it may be
   necessary to add two things to what has been said. The Prophet
   testified to the men of his age that salvation is by faith; it then
   follows that they had regard to Christ; for without relying on a
   mediator they could not have trusted in God. For as our righteousness
   is said to be the remission of sins, so a sacrifice must necessarily
   intervene, by which God is pacified, so as not to impute our sins. They
   had indeed their sacrifices according to the law; but these were to
   direct their minds to Christ; for they were by no means acceptable to
   God, except through that Mediator on whom our faith at this day is
   founded. There is also another thing: the Prophet, by distinctly
   expressing that the just live by faith, clearly shows, that through the
   whole course of this life we cannot be deemed just in any other way
   than by a gratuitous imputation. He does not say that the children of
   Adam, born in a state exposed to eternal death, do recover life by
   faith; but that the just, who are now endued with the true fear of God,
   live by faith; and thus refuted is the romance about initial
   justification. Let us now then proceed -

   Habakkuk 2:5

   5. Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man,
   neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as
   death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and
   heapeth unto him all people.

   5. Quanto magis (vel, etiam certe) vino transgrediens vir superbus, et
   non habitabit, quid dilatat quasi sepulchrum animam suam, et est
   similis morti, (ipse quasi mors, ad verbum,) et non satiabitur (non
   satiatur, significat actum continuum,) et colliget ad se omnes gentes,
   et coacervabit ad se omnes populos.


   The Prophet has taught us that a tranquil state of mind cannot be
   otherwise had than by recumbing on the grace of God alone; and that
   they who elate themselves, and fly in the air, and feed on the wind,
   procure for themselves many sorrows and inquietudes. But he now comes
   to the king of Babylon, and also to his kingdom; for in my judgement he
   speaks not only of the king, but includes also that tyrannical empire
   with its people, and represents them as a great company of robbers. He
   then says in short, that though the Babylonians, like drunken men,
   hurried here and there without any control, yet God's vengeance, by
   which they were to be brought to nothing, was nigh at hand. What ever
   therefore the Prophet subjoins to the end of the chapter tends to
   confirm his doctrine, which we have already explained--that the just
   shall live by faith. We cannot indeed be fully convinced of this except
   we hold firmly this principle--that God cares for us, and that the
   whole world is governed by his providence; so that it cannot be but
   that he will at length check the wicked, and punish their sins, and
   deliver the innocent who call upon him. Unless this be our conviction,
   there can be no benefit derived from our faith; we might indeed be a
   hundred times deceived; for experience teaches us that the hopes of
   men, as long as they are fixed on the earth, are vain and delusive, as
   they are only mere imaginations. Except then God governs the world
   there is no salvation to the faithful; for God in that case would
   delude them with vain promises, and they would flatter themselves with
   an empty prospect, or hope for that which is not. Hence the Prophet
   shows how it is that the just shall live by faith; and that is because
   the Lord will defend all who call upon him, and that inasmuch as he is
   the just Judge of all the world, he will finally execute judgement on
   all the wicked, though for a time they act wantonly, and think that
   they shall escape punishment, because God does not execute upon them
   immediate vengeance. We now perceive the design of the Prophet.

   As to the words, these two particles, 'ph ky, aph ki, when joined
   together, amplify the meaning; and some render them--"how much more;"
   others take them as a simple affirmative, and render them "truly." I
   approve of a middle course, and render them "yea, truly;" (Etiam
   certe;) and they are so taken as I think, in Genesis 3:1, Satan thus
   asked the woman--yea, truly! Est-ce pour vrai? for the question is that
   of one doubting, and yet it refers to what is certain,--"How comes it
   that God should interdict the eating of the fruit? yea, is it so truly?
   can it be so? So it is in this place, yea, truly, says the Prophet.
   That it is an amplification may be gathered from the context. He had
   said before that they who elevate themselves, or seem to themselves to
   be well fortified, are fearful in their minds, and driven backwards and
   forwards. He now advances another step--that when men are borne along
   by unrestrained wantonness, and promise themselves all things, as
   though there was no God, they surpass even the drunken, being hurried
   on by blind cupidity. When therefore men thus abandon themselves, can
   they escape the judgement of God? Far less bearable is such a madness
   than that simple arrogance of which he had spoken in the last verse.
   Thus then are the two verses connected together,--"Yea, truly, he who
   in his pride is like a drunken man, and restrains not himself, and who
   is even like to wild beasts or to the grave, devouring whatever meets
   them--he surely will not at length be endured by God." Vengeance, then,
   is nigh to all the proud, who are cruelly furious, passing all bounds
   and without any fear.

   But interpreters differ as to the import of the words which follow.
   Some render vvgd, bugad, to deceive, and it means so in some places;
   and they render the clause thus--"Wine deceives a proud man, and he
   will not dwell." This is indeed true, but the meaning is strained; I
   therefore prefer to follow the commonly received interpretation--that
   the proud man transgresses as it were through wine. At the same time I
   do not agree with others as to the expression "transgressing as through
   wine." Some give this version--"Man addicted to wine or to drunkenness
   transgresses;" and then they add--"a proud man will not inhabit;" but
   they pervert the sentence, and mangle the words of the Prophet; for his
   words are--By wine transgressing the proud man: he does not say that a
   man addicted to wine transgresses; but he compares the proud to drunken
   men, who, forgetting all reason and shame, abandon themselves unto all
   that is disgraceful; for the drunken distinguishes nothing, and becomes
   like a brute animal, so that he shuns nothing that is base and
   unbecoming. This is the reason why the Prophet compares proud men to
   the drunken, who transgress through wine, that is, who observe no
   moderation, but indulge themselves in excesses. We now then understand
   the real meaning of the Prophet, which many have not perceived. [31]

   As to the word inhabiting I take it in a metaphorical sense, as
   signifying to rest or to continue in the same place. The drunken are
   borne along by a certain excitement; so they do not restrain
   themselves, for they have no power over their feet or their hands: but
   as wine excites them, so they ramble here and there like insane
   persons. As then such an unruly temper lays hold on and bewilders
   drunken men, so the Prophet very aptly says that the proud man never
   rests.

   And the reason follows, (provided the meaning be approved,) because he
   enlarges as the grave his soul he is like to death. This is then the
   insatiableness which he had mentioned--that the proud cannot be
   satisfied, and therefore include heaven and earth and sea within the
   compass of their desires. Since then they thus run here and there, it
   is no wonder that the Prophet says that they do not rest. He enlarges
   then as the grave his soul; and then he adds--he heaps together, or
   congregates, or collects to himself all nations, and accumulates to
   himself all people; that is, the proud man keeps within no moderate
   limits; for though he were able to make one heap of all nations, he
   would yet think that not enough, like Alexander, who wept because he
   had not then enjoyed the empire of the whole world; and had he enjoyed
   it his tears would not have been dried; for he had heard that,
   according to the opinion of Democritus, there were many worlds. What
   did he mean? even this "Were I to obtain the empire of the world, I
   should still be poor; for if there are more worlds I should still wish
   to devour them all." These proud men surpass every kind of drunkenness.

   We now apprehend the meaning of the words; and though they contain a
   general truth, yet the Prophet no doubt applies them to the king of
   Babylon and to all the Chaldeans; for as it has been said, he includes
   the whole nation. He shows then here, that the Chaldeans were much
   worse and less excusable than those who with great fierceness elated
   themselves, for their rage carried them farther, as they wished to
   swallow up the whole world. But in order to express this more fully, he
   says that they were like drunken men; and he no doubt indirectly
   derides here the counsels of princes, who think themselves to be very
   wise, when either by deceit they oppress their neighbors, or by artful
   means seize for themselves on the lands of others, or by some
   contrivance, or even by force of arms, take possession of them. As
   princes take wonderful delight in their iniquities, so the Prophet says
   that they are like drunken men who transgress by wine, that is, who are
   completely overcome by excessive drinking; and at the same time he
   shows the cause of this drunkenness by mentioning the words gvr yhyr,
   "proud man." As then they are proud, so all their crafts are like the
   freaks of drunkenness, that is, furious, as when a man is deprived of
   reason by wine. Having thus spoken of the Babylonians he immediately
   adds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [31] Though the general meaning of the beginning of this verse is what
   most critics agree in, yet the construction is difficult. The only
   difference as to the meaning is, whether the proud man is said to be
   given to wine, or is compared to such an one, or to wine itself.
   Newcome takes the first, and gives this version-- Moreover, as a mighty
   man transgresseth through wine,
   He is proud, and remaineth not at rest. Henderson, agreeing with
   Grotius and Mede, takes the latter sense, and renders the line as
   follows:-- Moreoever wine is treacherous;
   The haughty man stayeth not at home. This is rather a paraphrase than a
   version; but this is the meaning of which the words are most capable.
   The two first participles need not be connected according to what
   Calvin proposes. Then the distich may be thus rendered-- And truly, as
   wine is treacherous,
   So is the proud man, and he will not rest. Then follows a delineation
   of his character-- Because he enlarges as the grave his desire,
   And he is like death and cannot be satisfied;
   For he gathers to himself all the nations,
   And collects to himself all the people. As to wine being treacherous,
   see Proverbs 30:1. Wine is pleasant to the taste and inviting in its
   color, but degrading, when taken immoderately, in its effects; so a
   proud and arrogant man is at first glittering and plausible, and
   splendid in his appearance, but afterwards cruel and oppressive. This
   seems to be the most obvious similitude, as contained in the passage.
   Parkhurst renders the two first lines as follows-- Yea, as when wine
   deceiveth a man,
   So he is proud, and is not at rest. He interprets "proud," as meaning
   "intoxicated with power and dominion," and refers to Daniel 4:30.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 2:6

   6. Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting
   proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is
   not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!

   6. Annon ipsi omnes super eum parabolam (vel apophthegma) tollent? et
   dicterium aenigmaticum (vel aenigmatum; alii [htsylm] vertunt
   interpretationem; sed dicemus de vocibus) ei (vel super eum,) et dicet,
   Vae qui mutiplicat non sua (vel ex non suis, qui sese locupletat ex
   alieno); quousque? et qui accumulat (vel aggravat) super se densum
   lutum.


   Now at length the Prophet denounces punishment on the Babylonian king
   and the Chaldeans; for the Lord would render them a sport to all. But
   some think that a punishment is also expressed in the preceding verse,
   such as awaits violent robbers, who devour the whole world. But I, on
   the contrary, think that the Prophet spoke before of proud cruelty, and
   simply showed what a destructive evil it is, being an insatiable
   cupidity; and now, as I have stated, he comes to its punishment; and he
   says first, that all the people who had been collected as it were into
   a heap, would take up a parable or a taunt, in order to scoff at the
   king of Babylon. When therefore the Chaldeans should possess the empire
   of almost the whole world, and subject to their power all their
   neighboring nations, all these would at length take up against them
   parables and taunts; and what would be said everywhere would be
   this--Woe to him who increases and enriches himself by things not his
   own. How long? that is, Is this to be perpetual? All then who thus
   increase themselves heap on themselves thick clay, by which they shall
   at last be overthrown.

   With regard to the words, msl, meshil is a short saying or a pithy
   sentence, and worthy to be remembered, as we have noticed elsewhere.
   Some render it parable. As to the word mlytsh, melitse, it probably
   signifies a scoff or a taunt, by which any one is reproved; for it
   comes from lvph, luts, which means to laugh at one or to deride him. It
   is indeed true, that the Hebrews call a rhetorician or an interpreter
   mlyph, melits; and hence some render mlytsh, melitse, interpretation;
   but it is not suitable to this passage; for the Prophet speaks here of
   taunts that would be cast against the king of Babylon. For as he had as
   with an open mouth swallowed up all, so also all would eagerly prick
   him with their goads, and disdainfully deride him. The word he
   afterwards adds chydvt, chidut, is to be read, I have no doubt, in the
   genitive case. [32] I therefore do not approve of adding a copulative,
   as many do, and read thus--"a taunt and an enigma." This word comes
   from the verb chvd, chud, which is to speak enigmatically; hence
   chydvt, chidut, are enigmas, or metaphors, or obscure sentences; and we
   know that when we wish to touch a man to the quick, there is more
   sharpness when we use an obscure word, which contains a metaphor or
   ambiguity, or something of this kind. It is not therefore without
   reason that the Prophet calls taunts, enigmas, chydvt, chidut, that is,
   obscure words, which bite or prick men sharply, as it were with goads.
   Hence in all scoffs a figurative language ought to be used; and except
   the expression be ambiguous or alliterative, or, in short, contain such
   metaphors as it is not necessary to recite here, there would be in it
   no beauty, no aptness. When therefore men wish to form biting taunts,
   they obscure what might be plainly said by some indirect metaphor; and
   this is the reason why the Prophet speaks here of a taunt that is
   enigmatical, for it is on that account more severe.

   And he shall say. There is a change of number in this verb, but it does
   not obscure the sense. [33] The particle hvy may be rendered "woe"; or
   it may be an exclamation, as when one is attracted by some particular
   sight, caca or sus; and so it is taken often by the Hebrews, and the
   context seems to favor this meaning, for "woe" would be frigid. When
   the Prophets pronounce a curse on the wicked, it is no doubt a dreadful
   threat; but what is found here is a taunt, by which the whole world
   would deride those haughty tyrants who thought that they ought to have
   been worshipped as gods. He! they say, where is he who multiplies
   himself by what belongs to another? and then, How long is this to be?
   even such accumulate on themselves thick clay; that is, they sink
   themselves in deep caverns, and heap on themselves mountains, by which
   they become overwhelmed. We now understand the meaning of the Prophet's
   words.

   What seems here to be the singing of triumph before the victory is no
   matter of wonder; for our faith, as it is well known, depends not on
   the judgement of the flesh, nor regards what is openly evident; but it
   is a vision of hidden things, as it is called in Hebrews 11:1, and the
   substance of things not seen. As then the firmness of faith is the
   same, though what it apprehends is remote, and as faith ceases not to
   see things hidden,--for through the mirror of God's word it ascends
   above heaven and earth, and penetrates into the spiritual kingdom of
   God,--as faith, then, possesses a view so distant, it is not to be
   wondered that the Prophet here boldly triumphs over the Babylonians,
   and now prescribes a derisive song for all nations, that the proud, who
   had previously with so much cruelty exalted themselves, might be
   scoffed at and derided.

   But were any to ask, whether it be right to assail even the wicked with
   scoffs and railleries, the question is unsuitable here; for the Prophet
   does not here refer to what is lawful for the faithful to do, but
   speaks only of what is commonly done by men: and we know that it is
   almost natural to men, that when those whom they had feared and dared
   not to blame as long as they were in power, are overthrown, they break
   forth against them not only with many complaints and accusations, but
   also with wanton rudeness. As, then, it usually happens, that all
   triumph over fallen tyrants, and throw forth their taunts, and all seek
   in this way to bite, the Prophet describes this regular course of
   things. It is not, however, to be doubted, but that he composed this
   song according to the nature of the case, when he says, that they were
   men who multiplied their own by what belonged to others; that is, that
   they gathered the wealth of others. It is indeed true, that many things
   are commonly spread abroad, for which there is no reason nor justice;
   but as some principles of equity and justice remain in the hearts of
   men, the consent of all nations is as it were the voice of nature, or
   the testimony of that equity which is engraven on the hearts of men,
   and which they can never obliterate. Such is the reason for this
   saying; for Habakkuk, by introducing the people as the speakers,
   propounded, as it were, the common law of nature, in which all agree;
   and that is,--that whosoever enriches himself by another's wealth,
   shall at length fall, and that when one accumulates great riches, these
   will become like a heap to cover and overwhelm him. And if any one of
   us will consult his own mind, he will find that this is engraven on his
   very nature.

   How, then, does it happen, that many should yet labor to get for
   themselves the wealth of others, and strive for nothing else through
   their whole life, but to spoil others that they may enrich themselves?
   It hence appears that men's minds are deprived of reason by
   sottishness, whenever they thus addict themselves to unjust gain, or
   when they give themselves loose reins to commit frauds, robberies, and
   plunders. And thus we perceive that the Prophet had not without reason
   represented all the proud and the cruel as drunken.

   Then follow the words, d-mty, od-mati, how long? This also is the
   dictate of nature; that is, that an end will some time be to unjust
   plunders, though God may not immediately check plunderers and wicked
   men, who proceed and effect their purposes by force and slaughters, and
   frauds and evil-doings. In the mean time the Prophet also intimates,
   that tyrants and their cruelty cannot be endured without great
   weariness and sorrow; for indignity on account of evil deeds kindles
   within the breasts of all, so that they become wearied when they see
   that wicked men are not soon restrained. Hence almost the whole world
   sound forth these words, How long, how long? When any one disturbs the
   whole world by his ambition and avarice, or everywhere commits
   plunders, or oppresses miserable nations,--when he distresses the
   innocent, all cry out, How long? And this cry, proceeding as it does
   from the feeling of nature and the dictate of justice, is at length
   heard by the Lord. For how comes it that all, being touched with
   weariness, cry out, How long? except that they know that this confusion
   of order and justice is not to be endured? And this feeling, is it not
   implanted in us by the Lord? It is then the same as though God heard
   himself, when he hears the cries and greenings of those who cannot bear
   injustice.

   But let us in the meantime see that no one of us should have to say the
   same thing to himself, which he brings forward against others. For when
   any avaricious man proceeds through right or wrong, as they say, when
   an ambitious man, by unfair means, advances himself, we instantly cry,
   How long? and when any tyrant violently oppresses helpless men, we
   always say, How long? Though every one says this as to others, yet no
   one as to himself. Let us therefore take heed that, when we reprove
   injustice in others, we come without delay to ourselves, and be
   impartial judges. Self love so blinds us, that we seek to absolve
   ourselves from that fault which we freely condemn in others. In general
   things men are always more correct in their judgement, that is, in
   matters in which they themselves are not concerned; but as soon as they
   come to themselves, they become blind, and all rectitude vanishes, and
   all judgement is gone. Let us then know, that this song is set forth
   here by the Prophet, drawn, as it were, from the common feeling of
   nature, in order that every one of us may put a restraint on himself
   when he discharges the office of a judge in condemning others, and that
   he may also condemn himself, and restrain his desires, when he finds
   them advancing beyond just bounds.

   We must also observe what he subjoins,--that the avaricious accumulate
   on themselves thick clay. This at first may appear incredible; but the
   subject itself plainly shows what the Prophet teaches here, provided
   our minds are not so blinded as not to see plain things. Hardly indeed
   an avaricious man can be found who is not a burden to himself, and to
   whom his wealth is not a source of trouble. Every one who has
   accumulated much, when he comes to old age, is afraid to use what he
   has got, being ever solicitous lest he should lose any thing; and then,
   as he thinks nothing is sufficient, the more he possesses the more
   grasping he becomes, and frugality is the name given to that sordid,
   and, so to speak, that servile restraint within which the rich confine
   themselves. In short, when any one forms a judgement of all the
   avaricious of this world, and is himself free from all avarice, having
   a free and unblessed mind, he will easily apprehend what the Prophet
   says here,--that all the wealth of this world is nothing else but a
   heap of clay, as when any one puts himself of his own accord under a
   great heap which he had collected together.

   Some refer this to the walls of Babylon, which were built of baked
   bricks, as it is well known; but this is too farfetched. Others think
   that the Prophet speaks of the last end of us all; for they who possess
   the greatest riches, being at last thrown into the grave, are covered
   with earth: but this also is not suitable here, any more than when they
   apply it to Nebuchadnezzar, that is, to that sottishness by which he
   had inebriated himself almost through his whole life; or when others
   apply it to Belshazzar, his grandson, because when he drank from the
   sacred vessels of the temple, he uttered slanders and blasphemies
   against God. These explanations are by no means suitable; for the
   Prophet does not here speak of the person of the king alone, but, as it
   has been said, he, on the contrary, summons to judgement the whole
   nation, which had given itself up to plunders and frauds and other evil
   deeds.

   Then a general truth is to be drawn from this expression that all the
   avaricious, the more they heap together, the more they lade themselves,
   and, as it were, bury themselves under a great load. Whence is this?
   Because riches, acquired by frauds and plunders, are nothing else than
   a heavy and cumbrous lump of earth: for God returns on the heads of
   those who thus seek to enrich themselves, whatever they have plundered
   from others. Had they been contented with some moderate portion, they
   might have lived cheerfully and happily, as we see to be the case with
   all the godly; who though they possess but little, are yet cheerful,
   for they live in hope, and know that their supplies are in God's hand,
   and expect everything from his blessing. Hence, then, their
   cheerfulness, because they have no anxious fears. But they who
   inebriate themselves with riches, find that they carry a useless
   burden, under which they lie down, as it were, sunk and buried.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [32] This can hardly be allowed; for in this case the final letter of
   the previous word must have been [t] and not [h]. It is a word
   evidently in appostion, designing the character of the proverb and the
   taunt, they being enigmas, conveyed in a highly figurative language.
   The whole verse may be thus rendered-- Shall not these, all of them,
   Raise against him a proverb and a taunt --
   Enigmas for him;
   Yea, say will every one--
   "Woe to him who multiplies what is not his own! how long!
   "And to him who accumulates on himself thick clay!" To render the last
   word [vtyt], (or [v tyt], apart, as given by ten MSS.,) "pledges," as
   it is done by Newcome and Henderson, does not comport at all with the
   rest of the passage. The Septuagint favor the common explanation, and
   also the Vulgate, and most commentators.--Ed.

   [33] It is rendered impersonally by Jerome "et dicetur--and it shall be
   said." Junius introduces a question, and supposed the just, who lives
   by faith to be referred to--"And shall not he, i.e., the just, say?"
   But Marckius considers that God is the speaker--"And he, i.e., God,
   shall say." But the most obvious construction is, that each one of the
   nations previously mentioned is introduced as speaking--"Unusquisque
   illorum--every one of them," is understood, says Piscator.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou deignest so far to condescend as to
   sustain the care of this life, and to supply us with whatever is
   needful for our pilgrimage--O grant that we may learn to rely on thee,
   and so to trust to thy blessing, as to abstain not only from all
   plunder and other evil deeds, but also from every unlawful coveting;
   and to continue in thy fear, and so to learn also to bear our poverty
   on the earth, that being content with those spiritual riches which thou
   offerest to us in thy gospel, and of which thou makes us now partakers,
   we may ever cheerfully aspire after that fullness of all blessings
   which we shall enjoin when at length we shall reach the celestial
   kingdom, and be perfectly united to thee, through Christ our Lord.
   Amen.

   Habakkuk 2:7

   7. Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that
   shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?

   7. Annon repente consurgent qui te mordeant, et evigilabunt qui te
   exagitent, et eris in conculcationes ipsis?


   The Prophet proceeds with the subject which we have already begun to
   explain; for he introduces here the common taunts against the king of
   Babylon and the whole tyrannical empire, by which many nations had been
   cruelly oppressed. He therefore says that enemies, who should bite him,
   [34] would suddenly and unexpectedly rise up. Some expound this of
   worms, but not rightly: for God not only inflicted punishment on the
   king when dead, but he intended also that there should be on earth an
   evident and a memorable proof of his vengeance on the Babylonians, by
   which it might be made known to all that their cruelty could not be
   suffered to go unpunished.

   The words, Shall not they rise suddenly, are emphatical, both as to the
   question and as to the word, pht, peto, suddenly. We indeed know that
   interrogations are more common in Hebrew than in Greek and Latin, and
   that they are stronger and more forcible. Our Prophet then speaks of
   what was indubitable. He adds, suddenly; for the Babylonians, relying
   on their own power, did not think that any evil was nigh them; and if
   any one dared to rise up against them, this could not have been so
   sudden, but they could have in time resisted and driven far away every
   danger. They indeed ruled far and wide; and we know that the wicked
   often sleep when they find themselves fortified on all sides. But the
   Prophet declares here that evil was nigh them, which would suddenly
   overwhelm them. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [34] This is rendered by Henderson, "that have lent thee on usury;" but
   incorrectly, as the corresponding clause is found in the following, and
   not, as he says, in the preceding line. The literal version is as
   follows,-- Shall not suddenly arise thy biters,
   And awake thy tormentors,
   And thou become for spoils to them? Now, the two corresponding words
   are "biters" and "tormentors;" and the idea of lending on usury cannot
   be admitted; and the common meaning of the word [nsk], is to bite, and
   means lending on usury only in Hiphil. What the Septuagint gives is
   daknontes-- biters. Here is an instance of the peculiar manner of the
   Prophets, and also of the writers of the New Testament; the most
   obvious act is mentioned first "arise," and then what is previous to
   it, "awake." There is also a similar difference in "biters" and
   "tormentors," or those who vex and harass: to torment or vex is not so
   great an evil as to bite, as it were, like a serpent; for such is the
   biting meant here.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 2:8

   8. Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the
   people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence
   of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.

   8. Quia tu spoliasti gentes multas, spoliabunt te omnes reliquiae
   populorum propter sanguines hominis et violentiam terrae, urbis et
   omnium habitantium in ea.


   The Prophet here expresses more clearly why the Babylonians were to be
   so severely dealt with by God. He shows that it would be a just reward
   that they should be plundered in their turn, who had previously given
   themselves up to plunder, violence, and cruelty. Since, then, they had
   exercised so much inhumanity towards all people, the Prophet intimates
   here that God could not be deemed as treating them cruelly, by
   inflicting on them so severe a punishment: he also confirms the former
   truth, and recalls the attention of the faithful to the judgement of
   God, as a main principle to be remembered; for when things in the world
   are in a state of confusion, we despond, and all hope vanishes, except
   this comes to our mind--that as God is the judge of the world it cannot
   be otherwise but that at length all the wicked must appear before his
   tribunal, and give there an account of all their deeds; and Scripture,
   also, is wont to set God before us as a judge, whenever the purpose is
   to allay our troubles. The Prophet now does the same thing: for he
   says, that robbers should soon come upon the Babylonians, who would
   plunder them; for God, the judge of the world, would not at last suffer
   so many plunders to be unpunished.

   But it was everywhere known that the Babylonians had, beyond all bounds
   and moderation, given themselves up to plunder, so that they spared no
   nations. Hence he says, because thou hast plundered many nations; and
   on this he enlarges; because the Babylonians had not only done wrongs
   to a few men, or to one people, but had marched through many countries.
   As, then, they had taken to themselves so much liberty in doing evil,
   the Prophet draws this conclusion--that they could not escape the hand
   of God, but that they were at length to find by experience that there
   was a God in heaven, who would repay them for their wrongs.

   He says also, Spoil thee shall the remnant of all people. This admits
   of two expositions; it may mean, that the people, who had been
   plundered by the Chaldeans, would take revenge on them: and he calls
   them a remnant, because they were not entire; but yet he intimates that
   they would be sufficient to take vengeance on the Babylonians. This
   view may be admitted, and yet we may suppose, that the Prophet takes in
   other nations, who had never been plundered; as though he had
   said--"Thou hast indeed spoiled many nations; but there are other
   nations in the world whom thy cruelty could not have reached. All the
   people then who remain in the world shall strive to outdo one another
   in attacking thee; and canst thou be strong enough to resist so great a
   power?" Either of these views may be admitted; that is, that in the
   wasted and plundered countries there would be still a remnant who would
   take vengeance,--or that the world contained other people who would
   willingly undertake this cause and execute vengeance on the
   Babylonians; for God would by his secret influence fulfill by their
   means his purpose of punishing them.

   He then adds, on account of man's blood; that is, because thou hast
   shed innocent blood, and because thou hast committed many plunders; for
   thou hast not only injured a few men, but thy daringness and cruelty
   have also extended to many nations. He indeed mentions the earth, and
   also the city. Some confine these words to the land of Judea and to
   Jerusalem, but not rightly; for the Prophet speaks here generally; and
   to the land, he joins cities and their inhabitants. [35]

   But this verse contains a truth which applies to all times. Let us then
   learn, during the licentious success of tyrants, to raise up our minds
   to heaven's tribunal, and to nourish our patience with this confidence,
   that the Lord, who is the judge of the world, will recompense these
   cruel and bloody robbers, and that the more licentious they are, the
   heavier judgement is nigh them; for the Lord will awaken and raise up
   as many to execute vengeance as there are men in the world, who by
   shedding blood will inflict punishment, though they may not intend to
   fulfill his purpose. God can indeed (as it has been often observed)
   execute his judgements in a wonderful and sudden manner. Let us hence
   also learn to restrain our evil desires; for none shall go unpunished
   who will allow themselves to injure their brethren; though they may
   seem to be unpunished for a time, yet God, who is ever the same, will
   at length return on their heads whatever they have devised against
   others, as we shall presently see again. He now adds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [35] So Grotius, Drusius, and Henderson regard the passage: the land,
   and the city, are supposed to have been used poetically for lands and
   cities. The word rendered "violence," [chms], means an unjust or wrong
   act done by force, an outrage, a violent injustice: hence Grotius
   rightly renders it here, "direptionem--robbing, pillaging, or
   plundering." While Newcome and others apply the passage to Judea and
   Jerusalem, the Septuagint version would lead us to suppose that Babylon
   was intended. The view taken here would be the most probable, were it
   not that the words are repeated at the end of verse 17; and there
   clearly they refer to the land of Judea and Jerusalem.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 2:9

   9. Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he
   may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of
   evil!

   9. Vae concupiscenti concupiscentiam malam domui suae, ut ponat in
   excelso nidum suum, quo se eripiat e manu (id est, e potestate)
   infortunii (mali, ad verbum.)


   Habakkuk proceeds in exciting the king of Babylon by taunts; which were
   not scurrilous jests, but contained serious threatening; for, as it has
   been already said, the Prophet here introduces indeed the common
   people, but in that multitude we are to recognize the innumerable
   heralds of God's vengeance: and hence he says, Woe to him who coveteth,
   etc.; or we may say, He! for it is a particle of exclamation, as it has
   been said: He! thou, he says, who covetest an evil covetousness to thy
   house, and settest on high thy nest: but what shall happen? The next
   verse declares the punishment.

   The clause, Woe to him who covets an evil covetousness to his house,
   may be read by itself,--that this cupidity shall be injurious to his
   house; as though he had said, "Thou indeed wouldest provide for thy
   house by accumulating great riches; but thy house shall find this to be
   evil and ruinous. So the word rh, roe, evil, might be referred to the
   house; but the verse is best connected by reading the whole together;
   that is, that the Babylonians not only provided for themselves, while
   they with avidity plundered and collected much wealth from all
   quarters; but that they wished also to make provisions for their sons
   and grandsons: and we also see, that avarice has this object in view;
   for they who are anxiously bent on the accumulation of riches do not
   only regard what is needful for themselves to pass through life, but
   also wish to leave their heirs rich. Since then the avaricious are
   desirous of enriching for ever their houses, the prophet, deriding this
   madness, says, Woe to him who covets an evil covetousness to his house;
   that is, who wishes not only to abound and be satiated himself, but
   also to supply his posterity with abundance.

   He adds another vice, which is almost ever connected with the
   former--that he may set, he says, his nest on high; for the avaricious
   have a regard to this--to fortify themselves; for as an evil conscience
   is always fearful, many dangers come across their minds--"This may
   happen to me," and then, "My wealth will procure for me the hatred and
   envy of many. If then some danger be at hand, I shall be able to redeem
   my life many times;" and he also adds, "Were I satisfied with a
   moderate portion, many would become my rivals; but when my treasures
   surpass what is common, then I shall be as it were beyond the reach of
   men; and when others envy one another, I shall escape." So the
   avaricious think within themselves when they are ardently bent on
   accumulating riches, and form for themselves a great heap like a nest;
   for they think that they are raised above the world, and are exempt
   from the common lot of men, when surrounded by their riches.

   We now then see what the Prophet means: Woe, he says, to him who
   wickedly and intemperately covets. And why does he so do? To enrich his
   posterity. And then he adds, to him who covets that he may set his nest
   on high; that is, that he may by wealth fortify himself, that he may be
   able to drive away every danger, and be thus exempt from every evil and
   trouble. And he adds, that he may deliver himself from the power of
   evil; he expresses now more clearly what I have said--that the rich are
   inebriated with false confidence, when they surpass all others; for
   they think not themselves to be mortals, but imagine that they have
   another life, as though they had a world of their own, free from all
   dangers. But while the avaricious thus elevate themselves by a proud
   confidence, the Prophet derides their madness. He then subjoins their
   punishment--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 2:10

   10. Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people,
   and hast sinned against thy soul.

   10. Consultasti in ignominiam domui tuae (vel, conflasti tuo consilio
   probrum et dedecus domui tuae) exidendo populos multos; et peccasti in
   animam tuam.


   The Prophet again confirms the truth, that those who count themselves
   happy, imagining that they are like God, busy themselves in vain; for
   God will turn to shame whatever they think to be their glory, derived
   from their riches. The avaricious indeed wish, as it appears from the
   last verse, to prepare splendor for their posterity, and they think to
   render illustrious their race by their wealth; for this is deemed to be
   nobility, that the richer any one is the more he excels, as he thinks,
   in dignity, and the more is he to be esteemed by all. Since, then, this
   is the object of almost all the avaricious, the Prophet here reminds
   them, that they are greatly deceived; for the Lord will not only
   frustrate their hopes, but will also convert their glory into shame.
   Hence he says, that they consult shame to their family.

   He includes in the word consult, all the industry, diligence, skill,
   care, and labor displayed by the avaricious. We indeed see how very
   sagacious they are; for if they smell any gain at a distance, they draw
   it to themselves, night and day they form new designs, that they may
   circumvent this person and plunder that person, and accumulate into
   their heap whatever money they can find, and also that they may join
   fields to fields, build great palaces, and secure great revenues. This
   is the reason why the Prophet says, that they consult shame. What is
   the object of all their designs? for they are, as we have said, very
   sharp and keen-sighted, they are also industrious, and torment
   themselves day and night with continual labor; for what purpose are all
   these things? even for this, that their posterity may be eminent, that
   their nobility may be in the mouth of all, and spread far and wide. But
   the Prophet shows that they labor in vain for God will turn to shame
   whatever they in their great wisdom contrived for the honor of their
   families. The more provident then the avaricious are, the more foolish
   they are, for they consult nothing but disgrace to their posterity.

   He adds, though thou cuttest off many people. This seems to have been
   expressed for the sake of anticipating an objection; for it might have
   seemed incredible that the Babylonians should form designs disgraceful
   to their posterity, when their fame was so eminent, and Babylon itself
   was like an idol, and the king was everywhere regarded with great
   reverence and also fear. Since then the Babylonians had made such
   advances, who could have thought it possible that what the Prophet
   declares here should take place? But, as I have already said, he meets
   these objections, and says, "Though the Babylonians shall conquer many
   enemies, and overthrow strong people, yet this will be of no advantage
   to them; nay, even that will turn out to their disgrace which they
   think will be to their glory."

   To the same purpose is what he adds, thou hast sinned against thy soul.
   Some give this version, "Thou hast sinned licentiously" or
   immoderately; others, "Thy soul has sinned," but these pervert the
   Prophet's meaning; for what he intended was nothing else but the evils
   which the avaricious and the cruel bring on themselves, and which will
   return on their own heads. When therefore the Babylonians contrived
   ruin for the whole world, the Prophet predicts that an end, very
   different from what they thought, would be to them: thou hast sinned,
   he says, against thine own soul; [36] that is, the evil which thou
   didst prepare to bring on others, shall be made by God to fall on thine
   own head.

   And this kind of declaration ought to be carefully noticed; that is,
   that the ungodly, while they trouble all, and harass all, while they
   torment one, plunder another, oppress another, do always sin against
   their own souls; that is, they do not cause so much loss and sorrow to
   others as to themselves: for the Lord will make the evil they intend
   for others to return on themselves. He does not speak here of guilt,
   but of punishment, when he says, "Thou hast sinned against thy soul;"
   that is, thou shalt receive the reward due to all thy sins. We now then
   see what the Prophet means. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [36] Literally, "sinning thy soul." We have in Proverbs 8:36, [ht'y],
   "my sinner," rendered no doubt correctly, "he that sinneth against me."
   So here "sinning thy soul," means "sinning against thy soul." See the
   same words in Proverbs 20:2. In Numbers 16:38, the preposition [v] is
   before "souls." "Thy soul hath sinned," as given by the Septuagint, and
   adopted by Newcome, does not convey the meaning; for to sin against our
   souls, is to injure ourselves so as to bring down judgment, as in the
   case mentioned in Numbers 16:38, while the other phrase conveys only
   the idea of doing what is wrong.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 2:11-13

   11. For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the
   timber shall answer it.

   11. Quia lapis ex muro clamabit, et lignum ex tabulato (ad verbum est,
   ex ligno,) respondebit ei.

   12. Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city
   by iniquity!

   12. Vae aedificanti urbem in sanguinibus, et paranti civitatem in
   iniquitate.

   13. Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour
   in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very
   vanity?

   13. Annon ecce a Jehova exercituum? ideo laborabunt populi in igne et
   gentes in vanitate (hoc est, frustra fatigabuntur.)


   There is here introduced by the Prophet a new personification. He had
   before prepared a common song, which would be in the mouth of all. He
   now ascribes speech to stones and wood, of which buildings are formed.
   The stone, he says, shall cry from the wall, and the wood from the
   chamber; that is, there is no part of the building that will not cry
   out that it was built by plunder, by cruelty, and, in a word, by evil
   deeds. The Prophet not only ascribes speech to wood and stone, but he
   makes them also respond one to the other as in a chorus, as in lyrics
   there are voices which take up the song in turns. The stone, he says,
   shall cry from the wall, and the wood shall respond to it from the
   chamber; [37] as though he said, "There will be a striking harmony in
   every part of the building; for the wall will begin and will utter its
   song, Behold I have been built by blood and by iniquity;' and the wood
   will utter the same, and will cry, Woe;' but all in due order; there
   will be no confused noise, but as music has distinct sounds, so also
   the stones will respond to the wood and the wood to the stones, so that
   there may be, as they say, corresponding voices."

   The stone, then, from the wall shall cry, and the wood shall answer
   --what will it answer?--Woe to him who builds a city by blood, and who
   adorns his city by iniquity. By blood and by iniquity he understands
   the same thing; for though the avaricious do not kill innocent men,
   they yet suck their blood, and what else is this but to kill them by
   degrees, by a slow tormenting process? For it is easier at once to
   undergo death than to pine away in want, as it happens to helpless men
   when spoiled and deprived of all their property. Wherever there is
   wanton plundering, there is murder committed in the sight of God; for
   as it has been said, he who spares not the helpless, but drinks up
   their blood, doubtless sins no less than if he were to kill them.

   But if this personification seems to any one strange, he must consider
   how incredible seemed to be what the Prophet here teaches, and how
   difficult it was to produce a conviction on the subject. We indeed
   confess that God is the judge of the world; nay, there is no one who
   does not anticipate his judgement by condemning avarice and cruelty;
   the very name of avarice is infamous and hated by all: the same may be
   said of cruelty. But yet when we see the avaricious in splendor and in
   esteem, we are astounded, and no one is able to foresee by faith what
   the Prophet here declares. Since, then our dullness is so great, or
   rather our sottishness, it is no wonder that the Prophet should here
   set before us the stones and the wood, as though he said, "When all
   prophecies and all warnings become frigid, and God himself obtains no
   credit, while openly declaring what he will do, and when his servants
   consume their labor in vain by warning and crying, let now the stones
   come forth, and be teachers to you who will not give ear to the voice
   of God himself, and let the wood also cry out in its turn." This, then,
   is the reason why the Prophet introduces here mute things as the
   speakers, even to awaken our insensibility.

   Then he adds, Shall it not be, behold, from Jehovah of hosts? [38] Some
   give a wrong version, "Is not this," as though hnh, ene, were put here
   instead of a pronoun demonstrative; but they extenuate and obscure the
   beauty of the expression; nay, they pervert the meaning of the Prophet:
   for when he says, hnh, ene, behold, he refers not to what he had said,
   nor specifies any particular thing, and yet he shows, as it were by the
   finger, the judgement of God, which he bids us to expect; as though he
   said, "Shall not God at length have his turn, when the avaricious and
   the cruel have obtained their triumphs in the world, and darkened the
   minds and thoughts of all, as though no account were to be given by
   them before the tribunal of God? Shall not God sometime show that it is
   his time to interpose?" When, therefore, he says, Shall it not be,
   behold, from Jehovah? it is an indefinite mode of speaking; he does not
   say, This or that shall be from the God of hosts; but, Shall it not be,
   behold, from Jehovah of hosts? that is, God seems now indeed to rest,
   and on this account men indulge themselves with greater boldness; but
   he will not always remain still, Shall not God then come forth, who
   seems now to be unconcerned? Something there will at length be from the
   God of hosts. And the demonstrative particle confirms the same thing:
   Behold, he says, as though he would show to the faithful as in a
   picture the tribunal of God, which cannot be seen by us now but by
   faith. He says, Behold, will not there be something from the God of
   hosts? that is, Will not God at length stretch forth his hand, to show
   that he is not unconcerned, but that he cares for the affairs of men?
   In a word, by this mode of speaking is pointed out to us the change,
   which we are to hope for, inasmuch as it cannot be soon realised.

   Hence he concludes, The people, then, labor in the fire, and the people
   weary themselves in vain. To labor in the fire means the same thing as
   to take in hand an unprofitable work, the fruit of which is immediately
   consumed. Some say that people labor in the fire, because Babylon had
   been built by a great number of men, and at length perished by fire;
   but this explanation seems far-fetched. I take a simpler view--that
   people labor in the fire, like him who performs a work, and a fire is
   put under it and consumes it; or like him, who with great labor
   polishes his own work, and a fire is prepared, which destroys it while
   in the hands of the artificer. For it is certain that the Prophet
   repeats the same thing in another form, when he says, vdy-ryq,
   bedi-rik, with vanity, or for vanity. We now then apprehend his object.

   We may here collect a useful doctrine--that not only the fruit of labor
   shall be lost by all who seek by wicked means to enrich themselves, but
   also that were the whole world favorable and subservient to them, the
   whole would yet be useless; as it happened to the king of Babylon,
   though he had many people ready to obey him. But the Prophet derides
   all those great preparations, for God had fire at hand to consume
   whatever they had so eagerly contrived who wished to spend all their
   labor to please one man. He at length adds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [37] The word rendered here "Wood," lignum, is [kphys], and only found
   here. The Septuagint has kantharos, a beetle,--Sym. sundesmos, bond,
   tie, or joint,--Theod. endesmos, bandage or jointing. The context shows
   that it must be something connected with wood-building. Parkhurst says,
   that it is a verb in Syriac, and means to connect, to fasten together,
   and he renders it a beam or a rafter, which would exactly suit this
   place. The word, [mph], "from the wood," evidently means the
   wood-building or wood-work. So that tabulatum, a story or a chamber in
   a building, as rendered by Calvin, is not amiss. Perhaps the best
   version would be,-- And the beam from the wood-work answers it. Bochart
   says, that [kphys], in Rabbinical writings, means a brick, and that it
   was usual, formerly, as it was in this country not long ago, to build
   with bricks and wood or timber together; and Henderson has adopted this
   meaning, but the other is more satisfactory.--Ed.

   [38] The construction of the first line of this verse, as given by
   Calvin, is stiff and unnatural. There is no doubt but that [hnh] is a
   pronoun in the plural number, and so it has been taken by the
   Septuagint, tauta, these things, and such is the rendering of the
   Syriac and Arabic versions. No improvement, perhaps, can be made on
   Newcome's rendering of this verse,-- Are not these things from Jehovah
   God of hosts,
   That people should labor for the fire,
   And nations should weary themselves for a vain thing? The intimation
   is, that all the buildings erected by blood and prepared by iniquity,
   were destined for the fire. "For the fire," [vdy 's], literally is, for
   the supply of fire, as Parkhurst renders the phrase: then it is, for
   the supply of emptiness or vacuity, [vry ryq]. The last two lines, with
   some variety, are found in Jeremiah 51:58, and applied to Babylon. In
   Jeremiah, "for a vain thing," is in the first line, and "for the fire"
   is in the second. Jeremiah puts the less evil first, and the greatest
   last; but Habakkuk's usual manner is the reverse, which has been before
   noticed, and we find an instance in the preceding verse, where he
   mentions "blood" first, and in the next line, "iniquity." That the
   destination of Babylon for the fire is here meant, seems evident from
   the following verse. See Jeremiah 51:25.--Ed.

   The Prophet briefly teaches us here, that so remarkable would be God's
   judgement on the Babylonians that his name would thereby be celebrated
   through the whole world. But there is in this verse an implied
   contrast; for God appeared not in his own glory when the Jews were led
   away into exile; the temple being demolished and the whole city
   destroyed; and also when the whole easterly region was exposed to
   rapine and plunder. When therefore the Babylonians were, after the
   Assyrians, swallowing up all their neighbors, the glory of God did not
   then shine, nor was it conspicuous in the world. The Jews themselves
   had become mute; for their miseries had, as it were, stupefied them;
   their mouths were at least closed, so that they could not from the
   heart bless God, while he was so severely afflicting them. And then, in
   that manifold confusion of all things, the profane thought that all
   things here take place fortuitously, and that there is no divine
   providence. God then was at that time hid: hence the Prophet says,
   Filled shall be the earth with the knowledge of God; that is, God will
   again become known, when by stretching forth his hand he will execute
   vengeance on the Babylonians; then will the Jews, as well as other
   nations, acknowledge that the world is governed by God's providence, as
   it had been once created by him.

   We now understand the Prophet's meaning, and why he says, that the
   earth would be filled with the knowledge of God's glory; for the glory
   of God previously disappeared from the world, with regard to the
   perceptions of men; but it shone forth again, when God himself had
   erected his tribunal by overthrowing Babylon, and thereby proved that
   there is no power among men which he cannot control. We have the same
   sentence in Isaiah 11:9. [39] The Prophet there speaks indeed of the
   kingdom of Christ; for when Christ was openly made known to the world,
   the knowledge of God's glory at the same time filled the earth; for God
   then appeared in his own living image. But yet our Prophet uses a
   proper language, when he says that the earth shall then be filled with
   the knowledge of God's glory, when he should execute vengeance on the
   Babylonians. Hence incorrectly have some applied this to the preaching
   of the gospel, as though Habakkuk made a transition from the ruin of
   Babylon to the general judgement: this is a strained exposition. It is
   indeed a well-known mode of speaking, and often occurs in the Psalms,
   that the power, grace, and truth of God are made known through the
   world, when he delivers his people and restrains the ungodly. The same
   mode the Prophet now adopts; and he compares this fullness of knowledge
   to the waters of the sea, because the sea, as we know, is so deep, that
   there is no measuring of its waters. So Habakkuk intimates, that the
   glory of God would be so much known that it would not only fill the
   world, but in a manner overflow it: as the waters of the sea by their
   vast quantity cover the deep, so the glory of God would fill heaven and
   earth, so as to have no limits. If, at the same time, there be a wish
   to extend this sentence to the coming of Christ, I do not object: for
   we know that the grace of redemption flowed in a perpetual stream until
   Christ appeared in the world. But the Prophet, I have no doubt, sets
   forth here the greatness of God's power in the destruction of Babylon.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [39] The idea is nearly the same, though not the words. The verse in
   Isaiah is literally this-- For fill the earth shall the knowledge of
   Jehovah,
   Like the waters spreading over the sea. The verb rendered "cover" here
   and in Isaiah is, [ksh], which means first to spread, and in the second
   place to cover, as the effect of spreading. It is followed here by [l],
   over, and by [l], over, in Isaiah; and so spreading must be the idea
   included in the verb. The comparison in Isaiah is between knowledge and
   waters, and the earth and the sea. Hence the common version does not
   properly present the comparison. The verb [ml'], is used in a passive
   and active sense. See Genesis 6:13, and Genesis 1:22; 24:16. This verse
   may be rendered in Welsh word for word, without changing the order in
   one instance:-- Canys henwa y ddaear wybodaeth o Jehova,
   Vel y dyvroedd dros y more yn ymdaenu. "The knowledge of Jeohovah," [dh
   't-yhvh], is not an instance of a genitive case by juxtaposition, which
   is common both in Hebrew and in Welsh; for ['t] here must be a
   preposition, "from," for it is sometimes used for [m't]. It is a
   knowledge that was to come from Jehovah, and not a knowledge of
   Jehovah.--Ed.

   [40] There is no reason to doubt but that this is the meaning of the
   sentence here: and it is a striking instance of the variety of meaning
   which belongs to similar expressions, when differently connected. The
   glory of God is manifested by judgments as well as by mercies. In
   Isaiah it is "the knowledge of or from Jehovah;" here the expression
   is, "the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah." By "the knowledge of
   Jehovah" is to be understood the revelation made by the gospel. But by
   "the knowledge of his glory" is meant evidently the display of his
   power in destroying Babylon, as power is often signified by glory.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are so inclined to do wrong, that every
   one is naturally disposed to consider his own private advantage--O
   grant that we may confine ourselves by that restraint which thou layest
   on us by thy Prophets, so that we may not allow our coveting to break
   forth so as to commit wrong or iniquity, but confine ourselves within
   the limits of what is just, and abstain from what belongs to others:
   may we also so learn to console ourselves in all our distresses, that
   though we may be justly oppressed by the wicked, we may yet rely on thy
   providence and righteous judgement, and patiently wait until thou
   deliverest us, and makes it manifest that whatever the wicked devise
   for our ruin, so cleaves to themselves as to return and recoil at
   length on their own heads; and may we so fight under the banner of the
   Cross, as to possess our souls in patience, until we at length shall
   attain that blessed life which is laid up in heaven for us, through our
   Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

   Habakkuk 2:15, 16

   15. Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy
   bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on
   his nakedness!

   15. Vae qui potat socium suum (vel, amicum;) conjungis (conjungens)
   calorem tuum (vel, utrem tuum; alii vertunt, adhibes venenum tuum, vel,
   iram tuam; alii intendens iram;) atque etiam inebrias, ut aspicias
   super nuditates eorum (id est, verenda.)

   16. Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy
   foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the Lord's right hand shall be turned
   unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.

   16. Saturatus es ignominia ex gloria (vel, pro gloria;) bibe etiam tu
   et disco-operire (vel, sopiares;) fundetur super te calix dexterae
   Jehovae, et vomitus ignominiae super gloriam tuam.


   This passage, in which the Prophet condemns the king of Babylon for his
   usual practice of rendering drunk his friends, is frigidly interpreted
   by most expounders. It has been already often said how bold the Jews
   are in contriving what is fabulous; when nothing certain occurs to
   them, they divine this or that without any discrimination or shame.
   Hence they say, that Nebuchadnezzar was given to excess, and led all
   whom he could into a participation of the same vice. They also think
   that his associates were captive kings, as though he bid them for the
   sake of sport to be brought to his table, and by drinking to their
   health, forced them to intoxication, that he might laugh at them when
   they made themselves base and ridiculous. But all this is groundless;
   for there is no history that relates any such thing. It is, however,
   easy to see that another matter is here treated of by the Prophet; for
   he does not speak of the king only, but he refers to the whole empire.
   I therefore doubt not but that this whole discourse, in which the
   Babylonian king is condemned for making drunk his associates or
   friends, is metaphorical or allegorical. But before I proceed further
   on the subject, I shall say something as to the words; for the meaning
   of the Prophet will thereby be made more evident.

   Woe, he says, to him who gives his friend drink; then he adds, msphch
   chmtk, mesephech chemetak, "who joinest and bottle." chmh, cheme, is
   taken in Hebrew for a bottle; and we know, and it is sufficiently
   evident from Scripture, that the Jews used bottles of skin, as there
   are casks and larger vessels with us. Since, then, they put their wine
   into bottles, these were often taken for their cups, as it is in our
   language, when one says, Des flacons, des bouteilles. Hence some give
   this explanation--that the king of Babylon brought forth his flagons,
   that he might force to intoxication, by excessive drinking, those who
   could not and dared not to resist his will. But others render chmh,
   cheme, wrath, with a preposition understood: and in order that nothing
   may be understood, some render the participle, msphch, "displaying,"
   that is, "his fury." But as chmh, cheme, means to be hot, we may,
   therefore, properly give this version, "Uniting thy heat;" that is, "It
   is not enough for thee to inebriate others, except thou implicates them
   with thyself." We now perceive the meaning of this phrase. He adds, And
   thou also dost inebriate. We may hence learn that the Prophet had no
   other thing in view, but to show that the king of Babylon sought for
   himself many associates in his intemperance or excess: at the same time
   he takes, as I have said, excess in a metaphorical sense. I shall
   presently explain more fully what all this means; but now we only
   expound the words. And thou, he says, dost also inebriate: the particle
   'ph, as it is well known, is laid down for the sake of amplifying.
   After having said, Thou unitest thy heat; that is, thou exhales thine
   intemperance, so that others also contract the same heat with thyself,
   he immediately adds, Thou inebriatest them. It follows, that their
   nakedness may be made open; that is, that they may disclose themselves
   with shame. The following verse I shall defer until we shall see more
   clearly what the Prophet had in view. [41]

   As I have already said the Prophet charges the Babylonian king with
   having implicated neighboring kings in his own evil desires, and with
   having in a manner inebriated them. He indeed compares the insatiable
   avarice of that king to intemperance; for as it is the object of
   drunken men not to drink what may suffice them, but to glut themselves
   with wine, so also when avarice is dominant in the hearts of men, they
   are seized with a certain kind of fury, like a person who has an
   immoderate love for wine. This is the reason for the metaphor; for the
   Babylonian king, when he thirsted for the blood of men, and also for
   wealth and kingdoms, led into the same kind of madness many other
   kings; for he could not have succeeded except he had allured the favor
   of many others, and deceived them with vain expectations. As a person
   who gives himself up to drinking wishes to leave associates, so
   Habakkuk lays the same thing to the charge of the king of Babylon; for
   being himself addicted to insatiable avarice, he procured associates to
   be as it were his guests, and quaffed wine to them, that is, elicited
   their cupidity, that they might join him in his wars; for each hoped
   for a part of the spoil after victory. Since, then, he had thus blinded
   many kings, they are said to have been inebriated by him. We indeed
   know that such allurements infatuate the minds and hearts of men; for
   there is no intoxication that stultifies men more than that eager
   appetite by which they devour both lands and seas.

   We now then apprehend what the Prophet meant--that the Babylonian king
   not only burnt with his own avarice, but kindled also, as it were, a
   flame in others, like drunken men who excite one another. As then he
   had thus inflamed all the neighboring kings to rush headlong without
   any consideration and without any shame, like a person suffocated and
   overcome by excessive drinking; so the Prophet designates this
   inflaming as quaffing wine to them.

   And this metaphor ought to be carefully observed; for we see at this
   day as in a mirror what the Prophet teaches here. For all the great
   princes, when they devise any plans of their own, send their
   ambassadors here and there, and seek to involve with themselves other
   cities and princes; and as no one is willing to endanger himself
   without reason, they set forth many fallacious allurements. And when
   any city fears a neighboring prince, it will seek to fortify itself by
   a new protection; so a treaty, when offered, becomes like a snare to
   it. And then when any inferior prince wishes to enlarge his borders, or
   to revenge himself, he willingly puts on arms, nay, anxiously, that he
   may be able, by the help of a greater, to effect his purpose, which he
   could not otherwise accomplish. Thus we see that dukes and counts, as
   they are called, and free cities, are daily inebriated. They who are
   chief kings, abounding in wine, that is, full of many vain promises,
   give to drink, as it were with full flagons, bidding wine to be brought
   forth on a well furnished table--"I will make thine enemy to give way
   to thee, and thou shalt compel him according to thy wish, and when I
   shall obtain the victory a part of the spoil shall be allotted to thee;
   I desire nothing but the glory. With regard to you, the free cities,
   see, ye tremble continually; now if you lie under my shadow, it will be
   the best security for you." Such quaffing is to be found at this day
   almost throughout the whole of Europe.

   Then the Prophet does not without reason commemorate this vice in the
   king of Babylon--that he made those associates drunk whom he had bound
   to himself by perfidious treaties; for as it has been said, there is no
   intoxication so dangerous as this madness; that is, when any one
   promises this or that to himself, and imagines what does not exist.
   Hence he not only says, that the Babylonian king gave drink to his
   friends, but also that he joined his bottles; as though he had said
   that he was very liberal, nay, prodigal, while seeking associates in
   his intemperance; for if one condition did not suffice, another was
   added--"Behold, my king is prepared; but if he is not enough another
   will be joined with him." They thus then join together their heat. If
   we take chmh, cheme, for a bottle, then to join together their bottles
   would mean, that they accumulated promises until they inebriated those
   whom they sought to deceive. But if the other interpretation be more
   approved, which I am disposed to follow, then the meaning would
   be--They join together their own heat, that is, they implicate others
   with themselves; as they burn themselves with insatiable cupidity, so
   they spread this ardor far and wide, so that the desires of many become
   united.

   He afterwards adds--that thou mayest see their nakedness. It was not
   indeed an object to the king of Babylon to disclose the reproach of all
   those whom he had induced to take part in his wars; but we know that
   great kings are wont to neglect their friends, to whom at first they
   promise every thing. When a king wishes to entice to himself a free
   city or an inferior prince, he will say--"See, I seek nothing but to be
   thy friend". We indeed see how shamefully they perjure themselves; nor
   is it enough for them to utter these perjuries in their courts; but not
   many years pass away before our great kings make public their
   abominable perjuries; and it appears immediately afterwards that they
   thus seek, without any shame, to mock both God and all mankind. After
   testifying that they seek nothing except to defend by their protection
   what is right and just, and to resist the tyranny and pride of others,
   they immediately draw back when anything adverse afterwards happens,
   and the city, which had hoped everything from so liberal a king, is
   afterwards forced to submit and to agree with its enemies, and to
   manage matters anyhow; thus its nakedness is disclosed. In the same
   manner also are inferior princes deprived of their power. And to whom
   is this to be imputed but to the principal author? For when any one,
   for the sake of ambition or avarice, leads others to inconvenience or
   to damage, he may justly and correctly be said to disclose their
   nakedness. We now apprehend the Prophet's real meaning, which
   interpreters have not understood. I come now to the next verse--

   He says that he is satiated with shame instead of glory. Some give this
   rendering--"Thou art satiated with shame more than glory;" but this
   does not suit the passage; for the Prophet does not mean that the
   Babylonian king was satiated with his own reproach, but rather with
   that of others. Secondly, the particle m, mem, is not put here in a
   comparative sense, but the clause is on the contrary to be understood
   thus--"By thy glory, or, on account of thy glory, thou art satiated
   with shame". It must also in the third place be observed, that
   punishment is not what the Prophet describes in these words; for it
   immediately follows--sth gm 'chh, shite gam ate, "drink thou also." He
   comes now to punishment. By saying, then, that the king of Babylon was
   satiated with shame on account of glory, it is the same as though he
   had said, that while he was intent on increasing his own glory he
   brought all others to shame. It is indeed the common game of great
   kings, as it has been said, to enlarge their own power at the expense
   and loss of others. They would, indeed, if they could, render their
   friends safe; but when any one loses ground in their favor they neglect
   him. We see how at this day great kings, raising great armies, shed
   innocent blood. When a slaughter is made in war they express their
   grief, but it is only on account of their own glory or advantage. They
   will in words profess that they sympathise with the miserable men who
   faithfully spent their life for them, but they have for them no real
   concern. As, then, great kings draw human blood, and care nothing when
   many perish for their sake, the Prophet justly says, That the king of
   Babylon was satiated with shame on account of glory; that is, that
   while he was seeking his own glory he was satiated with the reproaches
   of many; for many perished on his account, many had been robbed of
   their power, or were afterwards to be robbed--for the Prophet refers
   not here to what had taken place, but he speaks of things future; and
   the past tense of verbs was intended to express certainty; and we know
   that this was a common mode of speaking with the Prophets. [42]

   He now adds--drink thou also. We hence see that the king of Babylon was
   secure as long as he remained untouched, though his alliance and
   friendship had proved ruinous to many. As long then as his kingdom
   flourished, the king of Babylon cared but little for the losses of
   others. Hence the Prophet says--"Thou shalt also drink; thou thinkest
   that others only shall be punished, as though thou were not exposed to
   God's judgement; but thou shalt come in thy turn and drink;"--in what
   way? He speaks here allegorically of the vengeance which was nigh the
   king of Babylon--"Thou, also," he says, "shalt drink and become a
   reproach," or, shalt be uncovered.

   The word rl, orel, means in Hebrew the foreskin; and the foreskinned,
   or uncircumcised, was the name given to the profane and the base, or
   the contaminated; and hence many give this rendering--"Thou also shalt
   become ignominious;" but others express more clearly the Prophet's
   meaning by this version--"Thou shalt be uncovered." Yet their opinion
   is not amiss who think that there is here a change of letters, that
   hrl, eorel, is put for hrl, erol; and rl, rol, means to be cast asleep;
   and it well suits a drunken man to say that he is stupefied. But as the
   Prophet had spoken of nakedness, I retain the word as it is; and thus
   the two clauses will correspond--Then thou shalt drink and be uncovered

   Then follows the explanation--Poured forth [43] into thee shall be the
   cup of Jehovah's right hand; that is, "the Lord shall in his time be
   thy cup-bearer; as thou hast inebriated many nations, and under the
   pretense of friendship hast defrauded those who, being bound to thee by
   treaties, have been ruined; so the Lord will now recompense thee with
   the reward which thou hast deserved: As thou hast been a cup-bearer to
   others, so the Lord will now become thy cup-bearer, and will inebriate
   thee, but after another manner." We indeed know what the Scripture
   everywhere means by the cup of God's hand--even vengeance of every
   kind. God strikes some with giddiness and precipitates them, when
   deprived of all humanity, into a state of madness; others he infatuates
   by insensibility; some he deprives of all understanding, so that they
   perceive nothing aright; against others he rouses up enemies, who treat
   them with cruelty. Hence the Lord is said to extend his cup to the
   wicked whenever he takes vengeance on them.

   Therefore he adds--the reproach of spewing shall be on thy glory. The
   word qyqlvn, kikolun, is a compound. [44] We have already seen that
   qlvk, kolun, is shame; and now he speaks of shameful spewing. And this
   may be referred to the king of Babylon--that he himself would
   shamefully spew out what he had before intemperately swallowed down; or
   it might be fitly applied to his enemies--that they would spew in the
   face of the king of Babylon.

   The end of which Habakkuk speaks, awaits all tyrants, who disturb the
   world by their cupidity. Ambition does indeed so infatuate them, that
   they neither spare human blood, nor hesitate to endanger their nearest
   and most friendly associates. Since then an insatiable thirst for glory
   thus inflames them, the Prophet justly allots to them this reward--that
   they shall receive filthy and shameful spewing instead of that glory,
   in seeking which they observed no limits. Let us now proceed -
     __________________________________________________________________

   [41] The rendering of this verse has been various, though most agree as
   to its import. Grotius, Marckius, and Henderson, take nearly the same
   view of its meaning as Calvin, regarding it as metaphorical. But
   Marckius thinks that the drunkenness which the king of Babylon
   produced, means the evils which he inflicted on other nations. To make
   a nation drunk was to subdue and oppress it. See Isaiah 51:17,22;
   Jeremiah 25:15,16, 27,28; 51:7,39,57. This view is confirmed by the
   following verse, where the king of Babylon is threatened with a similar
   judgment; he was also to drink of the cup of Jehovah's right hand. As
   he made other nations drunk, so the Lord threatens him with a like
   visitation. The verse will admit of a much simpler rendering than what
   has been commonly offered, such as the following:-- Woe to him who
   makes his neighbor to drink,
   Who adds his bottle, and also strong drink,
   In order that he may look on their nakedness. To render [chmh], wrath,
   or heat, or gall, or poison, as some have done, is to introduce an idea
   foreign to the context, and the word is often found to signify the
   bottle of skin in which wine was kept. Newcome renders it "flagon." By
   mentioning bottle, abundance of wine was probably intended, and to this
   abundance was added the strong drink, [skr], intoxicating liquor. It is
   commonly rendered as though it were a verb in Hiphil; but it is not so.
   It means here no doubt, as in other places, strong drink. This line is
   only an application, as we find often in the Prophets, of the preceding
   line. Though there is no MS. which has "his" instead of "thy" connected
   with "bottle," yet the preceding and the following lines seem to
   require it; and this is the reading of Symmachus and of the Vulgate.
   The change of persons, it is true, is very common in the Prophets, but
   not in such a way as we find here, the third person being adopted both
   in the preceding and in the following line. The idea of drinking as a
   judgment may have arisen from the cup of malediction given to criminals
   before their execution. See also Psalms 75:8. Babylon is in Jeremiah
   51:7, represented as "a golden cup" in God's hand to make the nations
   drunken. It was "golden" to signify an outward appearance that was
   plausible, and alluring. So the mystic Babylon is said to have a golden
   cup, which was full of all abominations, Revelation 17:4.--Ed.

   [42] The view presented here of the first clause of the verse is
   striking, and such as the words may admit. But most commentators attach
   to them another meaning. Newcome's version is-- Thou art filled with
   shame instead of glory. Henderson's rendering is-- Thou art filled with
   shame, not with glory. The verb being in the past tense seems to favor
   Calvin's view--"Thou hast been satiated with shame from glory," that
   is, thou hast been filled to satiety with the shame occasioned to
   others, arising from the pursuit of thine own glory. And then, as
   Calvin justly observes, his punishment is denounced.--"Drink thou
   also."--Ed.

   [43] The verb [tsvv], loosely expressed here, is very correctly
   rendered by Henderson "shall come round;" and this is the idea which
   Calvin suggests in the following explanation.--Ed.

   [44] It is commonly derived from [qy], a contraction of [qy'], a vomit
   or spewing, and [qlvz], shame. Compounds are no common things in
   Hebrew; and these are found separate in nine MSS. The Septuagint have
   atimia, reproach only; and the Vulgate, "vomitus ignominiae--the
   spewing of shame." Newcome renders it "foul shame," and Henderson
   "great ignominy," regarding it as a reduplicate noun for [qlqlvz]. But
   as drunkenness is the metaphor used, "shameful spewing," or the spewing
   of shame or of reproach is most suitable to the passage.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 2:17

   17. For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of
   beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the
   violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.

   17. Quia violentia Libani operiet te et praedatio animalium, quae
   terruit ea (vel, quae contrivit,) propter sanguines hominis et
   violentiam terrae, urbis et omnium habitantium in ea.


   We may hence easily learn, that the Prophet has not been speaking of
   drunkenness, but that his discourse, as we have explained, was
   metaphorical; for here follows a reason, why he had denounced such a
   punishment on the king of Babylon, and that was, because he had
   exercised violence, not only against all nations indiscriminately, but
   also against the chosen people of God. He had before only set forth in
   general the cruelty with which the king of Babylon had destroyed many
   nations; but he now speaks distinctly of the Jews, in order to show
   that God would in a peculiar manner be the avenger of that cruelty
   which the Chaldeans had employed towards the Jews, because the Lord had
   taken that people under his own protection. Since then the king of
   Babylon had assailed the children of God, who had been adopted by him,
   and whose defender he was, he denounces upon him here a special
   punishment. We thus see that this discourse is properly addressed to
   the Jews; for he intended to bring them some consolation in their
   extreme evils, so that they might strengthen their patience; for they
   were thereby made to see that the wrongs done to them were come to a
   reckoning before God.

   By Libanus then we are to understand either Judea or the temple; for
   Libanus, as it is well known, was not far from the temple; and it is
   elsewhere found in the same sense. But if any extends this to the land
   of Judea, the meaning will be the same; there will be but little or no
   difference as to the subject that is handled. Because the violence then
   of Libanus shall overwhelm thee

   Then come the words, the pillaging of beasts. Interpreters think that
   the Chaldeans and Assyrians are here called vhmvt, bemutt, beasts, as
   they had been savage and cruel, like wild beasts, in laying waste
   Judea; but I rather understand by the beasts of Libanus those which
   inhabited that forest. The Prophet exaggerates the cruelty of the king
   of Babylon by this consideration, that he had been an enemy to brute
   beasts; and I consider the pronoun relative 'sr, asher, which, to be
   understood before the verb ychytn, ichiten, which may be taken to mean,
   to tear, or to frighten, Some give this rendering, "The plundering of
   beasts shall tear them;" as though he had said, "The Babylonians are
   indeed like savage beasts, but they shall be torn by their own
   plundering:" but another sense will be more suitable that the
   plundering of beasts, which terrified them, shall overwhelm thee; for
   the same verb, yvs, icas, shall cover or overwhelm the king of Babylon,
   is to be repeated here. He adds at last the clause, which was explained
   yesterday. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet to be--that the
   king of Babylon would be justly plundered, because he had destroyed the
   holy land and iniquitously attacked God's chosen people, and had also
   carried on his depredations through almost the whole of the Eastern
   world. [45] It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [45] It is commonly agreed, that Libanus here means either the temple
   or the land of Judah; most probably the last, according to the opinion
   of Jerome, Drusius, and others. The "violence," or outrage, of Libanus,
   means the violence done to it, as Newcome and others render the clause.
   The next line is more difficult: if the verb be retained as it is, we
   must either adopt what Calvin has proposed, and after him Drusius, or
   take the [v] at the beginning as a particle of comparison, according to
   what is done by Henderson, "As the destruction of beasts terrifieth
   them." But to preserve the parallelism of the two lines, it would be
   better to adopt the correction of all the early versions, Sept. Arab.
   Syr. and also of the Chald. par.; which substitute [d] for [z] and make
   the verb to be [ychytd]: and there are two MSS. which have [ycht]. In
   this case the rendering would be the following-- Because the violence
   done to Libanus shall overwhelm thee;
   And the depredation done to the beasts shall rend thee;
   On account of the blood of men, and of violence to the land,
   To the city, and to all who dwelt in it. The reason men are called
   "beasts" is because Libanus is mentioned which was inhabited by beasts;
   and in the two following lines the statement is more clear, and
   according to the order usually observed, "the depredation done to
   beasts" is "the blood of men;" and "the violence to Libanus" is
   "violence to the land." And then, as it is often the case in the
   Prophets, there is an addition made to the two last lines, "To the
   city," etc.-- Ed.

   Habakkuk 2:18

   18. What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven
   it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work
   trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?

   18. Quid prodest sculptile? quia sculpsit illud fictor ejus conflatile
   et doctorem mendacii; quia confidit fictor figmento suo, ut faciat
   idola muta.


   The Prophet now advances farther, and shows that whatever he had
   predicted of the future ruin of Babylon and of its monarchy, proceeded
   from the true God, from the God of Israel: for it would not have been
   sufficient to hold, that some deity existed in heaven, who ruled human
   affairs, so that it could not be, but that tyrants would have to suffer
   punishment for their cruelty. We indeed know that such sayings as these
   were everywhere common among heathen nations--that justice sits with
   Jupiter--that there is a Nemesis--that there is Divine vengeance. Since
   then such a conviction had ever been imprinted on the hearts of men, it
   would have been a frigid and almost an empty doctrine, had not the
   Prophet introduced the God of Israel. This is the reason why he now
   derides all idols, and claims for God the government of the whole
   world, and clearly shows that he speaks of the Jews, because they
   worshipped no imaginary gods, as the heathen nations, but plainly
   understood him to be the creator of heaven and earth, who revealed
   himself to Abraham, who gave his law by the hand of Moses. We now
   perceive the Prophet's design.

   As then the king of Babylon did himself worship his own gods, the
   Prophet dissipates that vain confidence, by which he might be deceived
   and deceive others. Hence he says, What avails the graven image? He
   speaks here contemptuously of images formed by men's hands. And he adds
   a reason, because the maker has graven it, he says. Interpreters give a
   sense that is very jejune, as though the Prophet had said, "What avails
   a graven image, when it is graven or melted by its artificer?" But the
   Prophet shows here the reason why the worship of idols is useless, and
   that is, because these gods are made of dead materials. And then he
   says, "What deity can the artificer produce?" We hence see that a
   reason is given in these words, and therefore we may more clearly
   render them thus--"What avails the graven image, when the framer has
   graven it?" that is, since the graven image has its origin from the
   hand and skill of man, what can it avail? He then adds, he has formed a
   molten image; that is, though the artificer has given form to the
   metal, or to the wood, or to the stone, yet he could not have changed
   its nature. He has indeed given it a certain external appearance; but
   were any one to ask what it is, the answer would surely be, "It is a
   graven image." Since then its nature is not changed by the work of man,
   it evidently appears, how stupid and mad must all those be who put
   their trust in graven images. [46]

   He then adds, and a teacher of falsehood. He added this clause, because
   men previously entertain false notions, and dare not to form a
   judgement on the matter itself. For, how comes it that a piece of wood
   or a stone is called a god? Had any one asked the sages at Rome or at
   Athens, or in other cities, who thought all other nations barbarous,
   What is that? on seeing a Jupiter made of silver; or of wood, or of
   stone, the answer would have been, "It is Jupiter, it is God." But how
   could this be? It is a stone, a piece of wood, or of silver. They would
   yet have asserted that it was God. Whence came this madness? Even from
   this, because men were bewitched, so that seeing they saw not; they
   wilfully closed their eyes, and resolved to be blind, being unwilling
   to understand. This is the reason why the Prophet, by way of
   anticipation, says, the artificer has formed --what has he formed? a
   graven image and a teacher of falsehood. The material remains the same,
   but a false notion prevails, for men think idols to be gods. How come
   they to think so? It is no doubt the teaching of falsehood, a mere
   illusion. He then confirms the same thing; the fashioner, or the
   artificer, he says, trusts in his own work, or in what he has formed.
   How is this? Must they not be void of sense and reason who trust in
   lifeless things? "The workman," as Isaiah says, "will take his
   instruments, will form an idol, and then he will bow the knee, and call
   it his god; yet it is the work of his own hands." What! art not thou
   thyself a god? thou knowest thine own frailty, and yet thou createst
   new gods! Even in this manner does the Prophet confirm what he had
   previously said, that men are extremely stupid, nay, that they are
   seized with monstrous sottishness, when they ascribe a kind of deity to
   wood, or to a stone, or to metal. How so? because they are, he says,
   false imaginations.

   And he adds, that he may make dumb idols. He again repeats what he had
   said,--that the nature of the material is not changed by men's
   workmanship, when they form to themselves gods either from wood or from
   stone. How so? because they cannot speak. To the same purpose is what
   immediately follows; the next verse must therefore be added. We shall
   afterwards say something more on the general subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [46] Rightly to understand this verse, it is necessary to remember that
   the graven and the molten image was the same; it was first graven and
   then covered with some metal, either of gold or of silver. See Note on
   Micah 1:7, [2]vol. 3, p. 167. This verse, as given in our version and
   in that of Newcome, presents hardly a meaning; and Henderson is not
   justified in the peculiar sense he gives to the particle [ky], taking
   it as a relative pronoun. The rendering of Calvin gives an evident and
   a striking sense. The verse may be thus literally rendered-- 18. What
   avails the graven image?--
   For its graver has formed it,--
   The molten image and the teacher of falsehood?
   For trust in it does the former of its form,
   After having made dumb idols. The last line show that the singular
   number before used is to be taken in a collective sense: and the
   preposition [l] before an infinitive has sometimes the meaning of
   "after." See Exodus 19:1, "When he has made," etc., is the rendering of
   Grotius.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 2:19

   19. Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone,
   Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver,
   and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

   19. Vae qui dicit ligno, Expergiscere; excitare, lapidi muto (mortuo,)
   ipse docebit: Ecce, ipse (vel ipsum lipsum, si vefaremus ad lignum;
   ipse ergo) opertus est auro et argento; et nullus spiritus in medio
   ejus.


   He pursues, as I have said, the same subject, and sharply inveighs
   against the sottishness of men, that they call on wood and stone, as
   though there were some hidden power in them. They say to the wood,
   Awake; for they implored help from their idols. Shall it teach? Some
   render it thus as a question; but I take it in a simpler form, "It will
   teach;" that is, "It is a wonder that ye are so wilfully foolish; for
   were God to send to you no Prophet, were there no one to instruct you,
   yet the wood and the stone would be sufficient teachers to you: ask
   your idols, that is, ascertain rightly what is in them. Doubtless, the
   god that is made of wood or of stone, sufficiently declares by his
   silence that he is no god. For there is no motion in wood and stone.
   Where there is no vigor and no life, is it not right to feel assured,
   that there is no deity? There are, indeed, many creatures endued with
   feeling and motion; but the God who gives power, and motion, and
   feeling to the whole world, and to all its parts, does he not surpass
   in these respects all his creatures? Since, then, wood and stone are
   silent, they are teachers sufficient for you, provided ye be apt
   scholars."

   We hence see how the Prophet in this way amplifies the insensibility of
   men; for they did not perceive what was quite manifest. The design of
   what follows is the same. Behold, it is covered over with gold and
   silver; that is, it is made splendid: for idolaters think that their
   gods are better when adorned with gold and silver; but yet there is no
   breath in the midst of them. "Look," he says, "within; look within, and
   ye shall see that they are dead." [47] The rest we shall dilate on
   to-morrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [47] With the exception of the clause, "It will teach," there is a
   general agreement in the mode of rendering this verse. "Shall it
   teach," is Newcome's version. Henderson considers it to be ironical,
   "It teach!" Grotius agrees with Calvin, "It will itself teach thee,"
   that is, that it is deaf, and no god. I regard the verse as capable of
   a simpler and more literal rendering, as follows: 19. Woe to him who
   saith to the wood, "Awake, Arise;"
   To the dumb stone, "It will teach:"
   Behold, it is covered with gold and silver!
   Yet there is no breath within it. The two verbs, "Awake, Arise," stand
   connected with "wood," and they are so given in the Septuagint; and
   there is a striking contrast between the dumb stone and teaching.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as there is in us so little of right
   judgement, and as our minds are blind even at mid-day,--O grant, that
   thy Spirit may always shine in us, and that being attentive to the
   light of thy word, we may also keep to the right way through the whole
   course of our pilgrimage, and subject to thee both ourselves and every
   action of our life, so that we may not be led by any allurements into
   the same ruin with the ungodly, who would deceive and entrap us, and
   who lie in wait on every side; but that being ruled by the counsel of
   thy Spirit, we may beware of all their intrigues: and may we,
   especially as to our spiritual life, be so given up to thee alone, as
   ever to keep ourselves far away from the defilements of all people, and
   so remain in the pure worship of thy majesty, that the ungodly may
   never draw us away into the same delusions with themselves, by which
   Satan so mightily deceives them; but may we follow Him as our leader
   whom thou wouldst have to be our ruler, even Christ thy Son, until he
   at length gathers us all into that celestial kingdom which he has
   purchased for us by his own blood. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Fourteenth

   We said yesterday, that the Prophet speaks now of idols, that he might
   deprive the king of Babylon of his vain confidence: for though heathens
   claim everything to themselves and to their own powers, yet their
   superstition in some measure dementates them. Hence the Prophet shows,
   that that tyrant in vain trusted in his idols, since they were things
   of nought. But the reasons by which he refutes idolatry ought to be
   noticed: he says, that the artificer, who formed gods, were not able to
   change the nature of the material, for the wood remained wood, and
   stone continued to be stone, and that the workmen and artificer in
   forming it did nothing more than make a molten image. The material then
   remained still the same. As to the image itself, the Prophet says, that
   it was mere falsehood and deception; yea, that gods made of wood or of
   silver, or of any other material, were instructors and teachers of
   falsehood, for they allured simple souls: and Satan spread his snares
   before men, when he set before their eyes these visible figures, and
   persuaded them that they contained something divine. Then this
   reasoning of the Prophet ought to be carefully observed; for he reminds
   us, that fictitious gods are made of lifeless and perishable materials,
   and that images are only the juggleries of Satan.

   That saying of Gregory is common among the Papists, that images are the
   books of the ignorant; for such was his answer to Serenus, bishop of
   Marseilles, who turned out images from all the churches (Lib. 9, Epist.
   9.) He said that he approved of his object, in wishing to correct the
   superstition which prevailed among the people, but that he had done
   what was not right in wholly taking away images, the books of the
   ignorant. But let us consider whether more faith is due to Gregory, a
   man imbued with many errors, (as that age was very corrupt), or to the
   Prophet Habakkuk, and also to Jeremiah, who announces nearly the same
   sentiment. Though, then, there is some speciousness in idols, yet the
   Prophet here reminds us that they are nothing but the impostures of
   Satan; for they teach falsehood. The reason also that is given is
   deserving of notice--that the workmen put their hope in what they
   themselves have formed. And it is indeed a thing most preposterous,
   that a mortal man should form his own god, and then imagine that
   something divine is enclosed in the very form, for deity is not in the
   material. The material is disregarded when unformed; but not so when it
   attains a beautiful shape. While the tree grows, while it produces
   flowers and fruit, it is deemed, as it really is, a dead thing; but
   when a piece of it is formed in the figure of a man, it is believed to
   be a god! But it is extremely absurd to suppose that the hand of the
   artificer gives deity to a dead material; for the wood is dead, and
   nothing is perceived but the shape given to it by man. Since, then, the
   artificer trusts in what he has formed, it is what seems beyond
   anything strange. It is hence quite evident, that men are wholly
   demented by the devil, when they worship their own workmanship.

   But now, in order to press the matter more fully on idolaters, the
   Prophet upbraids them for calling on the wood and on the stone to
   awake. It is certain, that when idolaters bow the knee before what they
   have themselves formed, they still imagine that there are celestial
   gods; but when before a figure of wood or stone they call upon God, it
   is the same thing as though they expected help from the wood and stone;
   for the question is not here what idolaters imagine, but the thing
   itself is to be regarded; and this is what the Prophet most fully and
   plainly condemns. Since, then, the superstitious are wont to address
   their prayers to wood and stone, he says, that they make to themselves
   gods, to whom they sacrifice. And the Prophet rightly refers in express
   terms to this kind of service; for the chief sacrifice which God bids
   to be offered to him, and demands from us, is to call on him; for we
   thus testify that life and all things belonging to salvation are found
   alone in him. Since, then, the majesty of God appears especially from
   having this testimony borne to him, that he is the fountain of life and
   of all blessings, every one who prostrates himself before a stone or
   wood, and implores the aid of a visible god, transfers, no doubt, the
   glory of the eternal God to a dead piece of wood or to a stone. If,
   then, we wish to be free from every superstition, let us remember this
   truth, that then only we have the only true God, when we direct our
   prayers and supplications to him alone, or, in a word, when we call on
   him alone. When we have recourse to dead idols, God is deprived of his
   own right. We may call him God a hundred times, but we give him an
   empty title, and one of no value, except we pray to him alone.

   The Prophet, in the last place, derides the madness of men, by saying
   that the very idols teach: for, as it was said yesterday, the clause is
   not to be read as a question, as some do; but in order more sharply to
   reprove the stupidity of men, the Prophet says, "Doubtless the very
   figures themselves, except ye are wholly senseless, will teach you." He
   had before said, it is true, that they were the teachers of falsehood
   and vanity; but he speaks now of another kind of teaching, that if men
   wisely attended to the thing itself, they might soon learn from a mere
   view of their gods, that they were most palpably the deceits of Satan;
   for if any one looked on the idols with a clear eye, he would see that
   they were a dead material, and would see that great wrong is done to
   God by transforming him into a likeness of what is dead.

   We now understand the Prophet's meaning, when he says, That idols
   themselves are sufficient, and more than sufficient teachers, when men
   are teachable, and lend an attentive ear. He means not, as it was said
   yesterday, that idols teach fallaciously to the destruction of men,
   while something divine is ascribed to them; but he says that they
   teach, if any one of a sane mind, and free from error, comes to view
   the idol, and forms a judgement of the thing itself. But superstition
   occupies the minds of men; and hence it is that all become the scholars
   of Satan, and no one applies his mind to understand the doctrine he
   mentions here. In short, idols teach naturally, and they teach through
   the artifice and delusion of Satan. They teach naturally; for by their
   silence they show that they are not gods, inasmuch as there is no
   strength in them. They teach, also, by the artifice of the devil; for
   they are made to claim a kind of divinity, and thus dazzle the minds of
   men, who are already corrupted by their own delusions. To the first
   teaching, of which the Prophet now speaks, none apply their minds; for
   almost all renounce nature wholly: this only lays hold on them--that
   idols are gods; for they make an image of the heavenly and eternal God,
   from whom we are at a great distance, and who does not otherwise
   descend to us, except through visible representations!

   The same truth the Prophet confirms when he says, that though these
   gods are covered over with gold and silver, there is no breath in them,
   or in the midst of them. In short, he means that they are mere masks;
   for no divinity can be without life. As then idols are dead things, it
   follows that they are the most palpable impostures of Satan, by which
   he fascinates the minds of men, when they thus devote themselves to
   dead things.

   Moreover, whatever is here said against idols, most certainly applies
   to the superstitions of popery. They deny that they give divine honors
   to their idols; but let us consider what the Prophet says. They indeed
   sacrifice to gold and silver, and then bend their knees before their
   images, and do not think that God is near them, except in these
   figures. Let them show, then, that the Prophet reasons here foolishly,
   or let them be held guilty according to the declaration, as it were, of
   the Holy Spirit, when they thus present their prayers before idols. It
   now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 2:20

   20. But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence
   before him.

   20. Jehova autem in templo sanctitatis suae (id est, in templo sancto
   suo:) sileat a facie ejus omnis terra.


   After having taught us that the Babylonians were deceived in expecting
   any help from their idols, and were deluded by Satan, Habakkuk now
   recalls the attention of the faithful to the only true God; for it
   would not have been enough to take away from the Babylonians the false
   confidence which they had in their idols, except the Israelites, on the
   other hand, trusting in the grace of the true God, were fully persuaded
   that God was on their side, as he had taken them under his protection.

   And we ought carefully to observe this order; for we see that many
   boldly deride all the superstitions which prevail in the world, and at
   the same time daringly and with cyclopic fury despise the true God. How
   many are at this day either Epicureans or Lucianians, who prate
   jestingly and scoffingly against the superstitions of the papacy, but
   in the meantime they are not influenced by any fear of God? If,
   however, we are to choose one of two evils, superstition is more
   tolerable than that gross impiety which obliterates every thought of a
   God. It is indeed true, that the more the superstitious toil in their
   delusions, the more they provoke God's wrath against them; for they
   transfer his glory to dead things; but yet they retain this
   principle--that honor and worship are due to God: but the profane, in
   whom there is no religion whatever, not only change God from what he
   is, but also strive as far as they can to reduce him to nothing. Hence
   I have said, that the order which the Prophet observes here ought to be
   maintained. For, after having overturned the false illusions of the
   devil, by which he deludes the superstitious, by setting before them a
   mere shadow in the place of the true God, he now sets up the true
   worship of the only true God. Then the Prophet has hitherto been
   endeavoring to subvert superstitions, but he now builds up: for except
   God, when idols are pulled down, ascends his own tribunal, and shines
   there as supreme according to his right, it would be better, at least
   it would be more tolerable, as I have said, that superstitions should
   be left entire.

   He now says that God is in his own temple or palace: this word is often
   taken for heaven, but is applied to the sanctuary. Many consider that
   the reference is made to heaven; as though the Prophet had said, that
   the true God, who is the artificer and creator of heaven and earth, is
   not to be seen in a visible form, nor covered over with gold and
   silver, nor represented by wood or stone; but that he rules in heaven,
   and fills heaven with his infinite glory and this view is by no means
   unsuitable. But as he here specially addresses the Jews, it seems to me
   more probable that he speaks of the temple, where God then designed to
   be worshipped, and sacrifices to be offered to him for it would not
   have been sufficient to set God, the creator of heaven and earth, in
   opposition to the superstitions of all the nations; but it was also
   necessary to introduce the contrast between the God of Israel and all
   those gods who then had obtained a name and reputation in the world, as
   they had been formed by the will of men. The God of Israel was indeed
   the creator of heaven and earth; but he had made himself known by his
   law, he had revealed himself to men, so that his majesty was not
   hidden; for when we speak of God, we are lost except he comes to us,
   and in a manner exhibits himself to us; for the capacity of our
   understanding is not so great that it can penetrate above all heavens.
   Hence the majesty of God is in itself incomprehensible to us; but he
   makes himself known by his works and by his word. Now as the Israelites
   worshipped, and surely knew that they worshipped the only true God, the
   Prophet here rightly confirms them in the hope they derived from the
   teaching of the law--that God was their Father, inasmuch as he had
   adopted them. If any prefer to take the word for heaven, I do not
   object; and that meaning, as I have said, is not unsuitable. But as the
   Prophet seems to me to have a special vies to his own people, to whom
   he was appointed a teacher; it is more probable that the word, temple
   or palace, is here to be understood of the sanctuary.

   If any raises the objection that there is then no difference between
   the God of Israel and the gods of the Gentiles, for he also dwells in
   an earthly habitation, the answer is obviously this--that though God is
   said to dwell between the cherubim, he has not been represented by an
   image, as though he had anything like to wood or stone, or possessed
   any likeness to human bodies. All these delusions were banished from
   the Temple; for he commanded his worshipers to look up to heaven. There
   was an intervening veil, that the people might understand that they
   could not otherwise come to God than through that celestial model, and
   the types of which they saw in the altar of incense, in the altar on
   which they sacrificed, in the table of the shewbread, in short, in all
   other services of the Temple. And there is another difference to be
   noticed; for though there was there the golden altar, though there was
   there the ark of the covenant, and the altar on which the victims were
   immolated, yet inscribed on all these typical representations was the
   word of God, by which alone true religion was to be distinguished from
   all false inventions. For whatever specious appearance of reason may
   therefore be in fictitious modes of worship, men have no authority to
   render them lawful; but so much reverence is due to the only true word
   of God, that it ought to overrule all other reasons. And besides, this
   word, as I have hinted already, did not retain the Jews in these
   delusions, but elevated their minds to heaven. We now then see that
   there was a wide difference between the Temple which was at Jerusalem,
   and the temples which the superstitious had then built for themselves
   throughout the world; for God ruled over the Jews, so that they could
   not have been deluded. And at this day, where the word of God shines
   among us, we can follow it with safety. And, further, God did
   spiritually draw to himself his own servants, though he employed, on
   account of their ignorance, certain outward elements. Hence the Prophet
   justly says, that God was in his palace or his Temple; for the
   Israelites knew of a certainty that they did not worship a fictitious
   God, since in his law he had revealed himself to them, and had chosen
   the sanctuary, where he intended to be worshipped in a typical, and yet
   in a spiritual manner.

   He then adds, Let all the earth be silent before him. Habakkuk, no
   doubt, commends the power of God, that the Israelites might proceed
   with alacrity in their religious course, knowing it to be a sufficient
   security to be under the protection of the only true God, and that they
   might not seek after the superstitions of the nations, nor be carried
   here and there, as it often happens, by vain desires. Keep silence,
   then, he says, let all the earth. He shows that though the Israelites
   might be far inferior to the Babylonians and other nations, and be far
   unequal to them in strength, military art, forces, and, in short, in
   all things of this kind, yet they would be always safe under the
   guardianship of God; for the Lord was able to control whatever power
   there might be in the world.

   We now see what the Prophet had in view: for he does not here simply
   exhort all people to worship God, but shows, that though men may grow
   mad against him, he yet can easily by his hand subjugate them; for
   after all the tumults made by kings and their people, the Lord can, by
   one breath of his mouth, dissipate all their attempts, however furious
   they may be. This, then, is the silence of which the Prophet now
   speaks. But there is another kind of silence, and that is, when we
   willingly submit to God; for silence in this respect is nothing else
   but submission: and we submit to God, when we bring not our own
   inventions and imaginations, but suffer ourselves to be taught by his
   word. We also submit to him, when we murmur not against his power or
   his judgements, when we humble ourselves under his powerful hand, and
   do not fiercely resist him, as those do who indulge their own lusts.
   This is indeed, as I have said, a voluntary submission: but the Prophet
   here shows that there is power in God to lay prostrate the whole world,
   and to tread it under his feet, whenever it may please him; so that the
   faithful have nothing to fear, for they know that their salvation is
   secured; for though the whole world were leagued against them, it yet
   cannot resist God. Now follows a prayer:--

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 3:1

   1. A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

   1. Precatio Chabakuk Prophetae super ignorantiis (vel, super canticis,
   aut instrumentis musicis.)


   There is no doubt but that the Prophet dictated this form of prayer for
   his people, before they were led into exile, that they might always
   exercise themselves in the study of religion. We indeed know that God
   cannot be rightly and from the heart worshipped but in faith. Hence, in
   order to confine the dispersed Israelites within due limits, so that
   they might not fall away from true religion, the Prophet here sets
   before them the materials of faith, and stimulates them to prayer: and
   we know, that our faith cannot be supported in a better way than by the
   exercise of prayer.

   Let us then bear in mind, that the way of fostering true religion,
   prescribed here to the miserable Israelites while dispersed in their
   exile, was to look up to God daily, that they might strengthen their
   faith; for they could not have otherwise continued in their obedience
   to God. They would, indeed, have wholly fallen away into the
   superstitions of the Gentiles, had not the memory of the covenant,
   which the Lord had made with them, remained firm in their hearts: and
   we shall presently see that the Prophet lays much stress upon this
   circumstance.

   He calls it his own prayer, [48] not because he used it himself
   privately, or composed it for himself, but that the prayer might have
   some authority among the people; for they knew that a form of prayer
   dictated for them by the mouth of a Prophet, was the same as though the
   Spirit itself was to show them how they were to pray to God. The name,
   then, of Habakkuk is added to it, not because he used it himself, but
   that the people might be more encouraged to pray, when they knew that
   the Holy Spirit, through the Prophet, had become their guide and
   teacher.

   There is some difficulty connected with the word sgynvt, sheginut. The
   verb sgg, shegag, or sgh, shege, means, to act inconsiderately; and
   from sgh, shege, is derived sgyvn, shegiun. Many render it, ignorance;
   some, delight. Some think it to be the beginning of a song; others
   suppose it to be a common melody; and others, a musical instrument.
   Thus interpreters differ. In the seventh Psalm David, no doubt, calls
   either a song or some musical instrument by the word sgyvn, shegiun.
   Yet some think that David bears testimony there to his own innocency;
   and that, as he was not conscious of having done wrong, his own
   innocency is alone signified by the title: but this is a strained view.
   The word is taken in this place, almost by common consent, for
   ignorances: and we know that the Hebrews denominate by ignorances all
   errors or falls which are not grievous, and such things as happen
   through inadvertence; and by this word they do not extenuate their
   faults, but acknowledge themselves to be inconsiderate when they
   offend. Then sgyvn, shegiun, is no excusable ignorance, which men lay
   hold on as a pretext; but an error of folly and presumptions, when men
   are not sufficiently attentive to the word of God. But perhaps the word
   sgynvt, sheginut, being here in the plural number, ought to be taken
   for musical instruments. Yet as I would not willingly depart from a
   received opinion, and as there is no necessity in this case to
   constrain us to depart from it, let us follow what had been already
   said,--that the Prophet dictates here for his people a form of prayer
   for ignorances, that is, that they could not otherwise hope for God's
   forgiveness than by seeking his favor. [49] And how can we be
   reconciled to God, except by his not imputing to us our sins?

   But the Prophet, by asking for the pardons of ignorances, does not omit
   more grievous sins; but intimates that though their conscience does not
   reprove men, they are yet not on that account innocent and without
   guilt; for they often inconsiderately fall, and their faults are not to
   be excused for inadvertence. It is, then, the same thing as though the
   Prophet reminded his own people, that there was no remedy for them in
   adversity but by fleeing to God, and fleeing as suppliants, in order to
   solicit his forgiveness; and that they were not only to acknowledge
   their more grievous sins, but also to confess that they were in many
   respects guilty; for they might have fallen through error a thousand
   times, as we are inconsiderate almost through the whole course of our
   life. We now, then, perceive what this word means, and why the Prophet
   spoke rather of ignorances than of other sins. But I shall not proceed
   farther now, as there is some other business.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [48] The more correct rendering here would be, "A Prayer (or rather, An
   Intercession) by Habakkuk the Prophet;" that is, It was a prayer
   composed by him. The preposition [l] before Habakkuk, as often before
   David in the Psalms, would be better rendered in this way, than by
   "of;" for the meaning is, not that it was his prayer, that is, one
   offered up by him, but that it was composed by him. "A Psalm of David,"
   ought to be, "A Psalm by David."--Ed.

   [49] This explanation, adopted by Calvin, is derived originally from
   Aquila and Symmachus, who rendered the phrase, epi
   agoematon,--respecting oversights or errors: and they have been
   followed by Jerome, Vulgate, etc. The prior version of the Septuagint
   is, met ' oddes,--with an ode that this prayer is composed in metre, is
   evident from the word, "Selah," and from the conclusion of the chapter.
   The most probable meaning of the word is what Drusius has suggested,
   and adopted by Grotius, Marckius, and Henderson, and that is, that it
   refers to a peculiar metre, a kind of composition, which from its
   irregularity is called erratica cantio, an erratic verse. "The prayer
   of Habakkuk," says Drusius, "was to be sung according to the odes which
   they called Sigionoth." To the same purpose is what Grotius says, that
   is, it is "a song according to the notes of an ancient ode which began
   with this word." It is derived from [sgh], to go astray, to wander,
   that is, in this instance, from the regular metre of an ode. It is an
   erratic ode, that is, one containing varieties. It may be thus
   paraphrastically expressed, "According to the notes of the irregular
   ode;" or, as it is in the margin of our Bibles, "According to variable
   songs or tunes."--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast deigned to make thyself known to
   us by thy word, and as thou elevates us to thyself in a way suitable to
   the ignorance of our minds,--O grant, that we may not continue fixed in
   our stupidity, but that we may put off all superstitions, and also
   renounce all the thoughts of our flesh, and seek thee in the right way;
   and may we suffer ourselves to be so ruled by thy word, that we may
   purely and from the heart call upon thee, and so rely on thine infinite
   power, that we may not fear to despise the whole world, and every
   adversity on the earth, until, having finished our warfare, we shall at
   length be gathered into that blessed rest, which thine only-begotten
   Son has procured for us by his own blood--Amen.

   Habakkuk 3:2

   2. O Lord, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O Lord, revive thy
   work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known;
   in wrath remember mercy.

   2. Jehova, audivi vocem tuam (auditum tuum, ad verbum, [dms]; [50] )
   Jehova, opus tuum in medio annorum vivifica illud (sed relativum
   pronomen abundat;) in medio annorum notum fac; in ira misericordiae
   recorderis.


   The Prophet says here, in the name of the whole people, that he was
   terrified by the voice of God, for so I understand the word, though in
   many places it means report, as some also explain it in this place. But
   as the preaching of the Gospel is called in Isaiah 53:1, smh, shemoe,
   report, it seems to me more suitable to the present passage to render
   it the voice of God; for the general sentiment, that the faithful were
   terrified at the report of God, would be frigid. It ought rather to be
   applied to the Prophecies which have been already explained: and
   doubtless Habakkuk did not intend here to speak only in general of
   God's power; but, as we have seen in the last lecture, he humbly
   confesses the sins of the people, and then prays for forgiveness. It is
   then not to be doubted but that he says here, that he was terrified by
   the voice of God, that is, when he heard him threatening punishment so
   grievous. He then adds, Revive thy work in the middle of the years, and
   make it known. At last, by way of anticipation, he subjoins, that God
   would remember his mercy, though justly offended by the sins of the
   people.

   But by saying, that he feared the voice of God, he makes a confession,
   or gives an evidence of repentance; for we cannot from the heart seek
   pardon, unless we be first made humble. When a sinner is not displeased
   with himself, and confesses not his guilt, he is not deserving of
   mercy. We then see why the Prophet speaks here of fear; and that is,
   that he might thus obtain for himself and for others the favor of God;
   for as soon as a sinner willingly condemns himself, and does not do
   this formally, but seriously from the heart, he is already reconciled
   to God; for God bids us in this way to anticipate his judgement. This
   is one thing. But if it be asked, for what purpose the Prophet heard
   God's voice; the obvious answer is,--that as it is not the private
   prayer of one person, but of the whole Church, he prescribes here to
   the faithful the way by which they were to obtain favor from God, and
   turn him to mercy; and that is, by dreading his threatening and by
   acknowledging that whatever God threatened by his Prophets was near at
   hand.

   Then follows the second clause, Jehovah! in the middle of the years
   revive thy work. By the work of God he means the condition of his
   people or of the Church. For though God is the creator of heaven and
   earth, he would yet have his own Church to be acknowledged to be, as it
   were, his peculiar workmanship, and a special monument of his power,
   wisdom, justice, and goodness. Hence, by way of eminence, he calls here
   the condition of the elect people the work of God; for the seed of
   Abraham was not only a part of the human race, but was the holy and
   peculiar possession of God. Since, then, the Israelites were set apart
   by the Lord, they are rightly called his work; as we read in another
   place,

   "The work of thine hands thou wilt not despise,"
   Psalm 138:8.

   And God often says, "This is my planting," "This is the work of my
   hands," when he speaks of his Church.

   By the middle of the years, he means the middle course, as it were, of
   the people's life. For from the time when God chose the race of Abraham
   to the coming of Christ, was the whole course, as it were, of their
   life, when we compare the people to a man; for the fullness of their
   age was at the coming of Christ. If, then, that people had been
   destroyed, it would have been the same as though death were to snatch
   away a person in the flower of his age. Hence the Prophet prays God not
   to take away the life of his people in the middle of their course; for
   Christ having not come, the people had not attained maturity, nor
   arrived at manhood. In the middle, then, of the years thy work revive;
   that is, "Though we seem destined to death, yet restore us." Make it
   known, he says, in the middle of the years; that is, "Show it to be in
   reality thy work." [51]

   We now apprehend the real meaning of the Prophet. After having
   confessed that the Israelites justly trembled at God's voice, as they
   saw themselves deservedly given up to perdition, he then appeals to the
   mercy of God, and prays God to revive his own work. He brings forward
   here nothing but the favor of adoption: thus he confesses that there
   was no reason why God should forgive his people, except that he had
   been pleased freely to adopt them, and to choose them as his peculiar
   people; for on this account it is that God is wont to show his favor
   towards us even to the last. as, then, this people had been once chosen
   by God, the Prophet records this adoption and prays God to continue and
   fulfill to the end what he had begun. With regard to the half course of
   life, the comparison ought to be observed; for we see that the race of
   Abraham was not chosen for a short time, but until Christ the Redeemer
   was manifested. Now we have this in common with the ancient people,
   that God adopts us, that he may at length bring us into the inheritance
   of eternal life. Until, then, the work of our salvation is completed,
   we are, as it were, running our course. We may therefore adopt this
   form of prayer, which is prescribed for us by the Holy Spirit,--that
   God would not forsake his own work; in the middle of our course.

   What he now subjoins--in wrath remember mercy, is intended to
   anticipate an objection; for this thought might have occurred to the
   faithful--"there is no ground for us to hope pardon from God, whom we
   have so grievously provoked, nor is there any reason for us to rely any
   more on the covenant which we have so perfidiously violated." The
   Prophet meets this objection, and he flees to the gracious favor of
   God, however much he perceived that the people would have to suffer the
   just punishment of their sins, such as they deserved. He then confesses
   that God was justly angry with his people, and yet that the hope of
   salvation was not on that account closed up, for the Lord had promised
   to be propitious. Since God then is not inexorable towards his
   people--nay, while he chastises them he ceases not to be a father;
   hence the Prophet connects here the mercy of God with his wrath.

   We have elsewhere said that the word wrath is not to be taken according
   to its strict sense, when the faithful or the elect are spoken of; for
   God does not chastise them because he hates them; nay, on the contrary,
   he thereby manifests the care he has for their salvations. Hence the
   scourges by which God chastises his children are testimonies of his
   love. But the Scripture represents the judgement with which God visits
   his people as wrath, not towards their persons but towards their sins.
   Though then God shows love to his chosen, yet he testifies when he
   punishes their sins that iniquity is hated by him. When God then comes
   forth as it were as a judge, and shows that sins displease him, he is
   said to be angry with the faithful; and there is also in this a
   reference to the perceptions of men; for we cannot, when God chastises
   us, do otherwise than feel the accusations of our own conscience. Hence
   then is this hatred; for when our conscience condemns us we must
   necessarily acknowledge God to be angry with us, that is with respect
   to us. When therefore we provoke God's wrath by our sins we feel him to
   be angry with us; but yet the Prophet collects together things which
   seem wholly contrary--even that God would remember mercy in wrath; that
   is, that he would show himself displeased with them in such a way as to
   afford to the faithful at the same time some taste of his favor and
   mercy by finding him to be propitious to them.

   We now then perceive how the Prophet had joined the last clause to the
   foregoing. Whenever, then, the judgement of the flesh would lead us to
   despair, let us ever set up against it this truth--that God is in such
   a way angry that he never forgets his mercy--that is, in his dealings
   with his elect. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [50] The verb, "territus sum,--I feared," has been omitted. It is even
   omitted in the French version.--Ed.

   [51] The view given of "the middle of the years," is ingenious and
   striking; but the common interpretation is, that "the years" of
   calamity, allotted to the Jews, are meant. The Septuagint version of
   this verse is so extremely wide of the original, that none can account
   for the differences. There are no various readings of any moment; and
   the literal rendering of this verse, and of the former part of the
   following, I consider to be this,-- 2. O Jehovah! I have heard thy
   report;
   I feared, O Jehovah!
   Thy work! in the midst of the years revive it;
   In the midst of the years make it known;
   In anger remember mercy: 3. May God from Teman come
   And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. It is called "thy report," as
   it was a report which came from God; the allusion is to the
   threatenings in chapter 1. "The report from thee," would convey the
   sense. The third line is a prayer; and so are the following lines,
   though all the verbs are in the future tense, while that for "revive"
   is in the imperative mood. The third verse ought to end with the word
   "Selah." What follows in the other part and in the subsequent verses,
   is a relation of what took place when God had formerly interfered in
   behalf of Israel; while here, and in the latter part of the preceding
   verse, the Prophet expresses a prayer to God in reference to his
   people, and borrows his language from the past interpositions of
   God.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 3:3

   3. God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His
   glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.

   3. Deus de Theman veniet, et Sanctus e monte Paran. Selach. [52]
   Operuit coelos decor (vel, gloria) ejus; laude ejus plena est terra.


   This verse interpreters explain in two ways. Some construe the verb in
   the future tense in the past time--"God went forth from Teman, and the
   holy one from mount Paran"; for a verb in the past tense follows. But
   others consider it to be in the optative mood--"May God come, or go
   forth, from Teman, and the holy one from mount Paran;" as though the
   Prophet prayed God to come as the defender of his people from mount
   Sinai, where the law was promulgated and the covenant ratified, which
   God had formerly made with Abraham and his posterity. I rather
   subscribe to their opinion who think that the manifestation of God, by
   which he had testified that he was the guardian of that people, is
   repeated by the Prophet. As, then, God had so made known his glory on
   mount Sinai, that it was evident that that nation was under his
   protection, so the Prophet, with the view of strengthening himself and
   others, records what was well known among the whole people--that is,
   that the law was given on mount Sinai, which was a testimony of
   singular favor; for God then by a new pledge testified, that the
   covenant formerly made with Abraham was firm and inviolable. The reason
   why Habakkuk does not mention mount Sinai, but Teman and Paran, seems
   to some to be this--because these mountains were nearer the Holy Land,
   though this view, I fear, will appear too refined; I therefore take
   this simple view--that instead of mentioning mount Sinai, he
   paraphrastically designates it by mount Paran and the desert of Teman.
   Some suppose these to be two mountains; but I know not whether Teman
   ought to be understood only as a mountain; it seems on the contrary to
   have been some large tract of country. It was a common thing among the
   Jews to add this name when they spoke of the south, as many nations
   were wont to give to winds the names of some neighboring places; so
   when the Jews wished to designate a wind from Africa, they called it
   Teman. "It is a Teman wind;" and so when they spoke of the south, they
   said Teman.

   However this may be, it is certain that the desert of Teman was nigh to
   Sinai, and also that mount Paran was connected with that desert. As
   then they were places towards the south, and nigh to mount Sinai, where
   the law had been proclaimed, the Prophet records here, in order to
   strengthen the faith of the whole people, that God had not in vain gone
   forth once from Teman, and there appeared in his celestial power; for
   God then openly showed, that he took under his guardianship the
   children of Abraham, and that the covenant which he had formerly made
   with him was not vain or of no effect. Since, then, God had testified
   this in so remarkable and wonderful a manner, the Prophet brings
   forward here that history which tended especially to confirm the faith
   of the godly--God went forth once from Teman, and the holy one from
   mount Paran.

   For it was not God's will that the memory of that manifestation should
   be obliterated; but he had once appeared with glory so magnificent,
   that the people might feel assured that they would ever be safe, for
   they were protected by God's hand, and that full of power, as the
   fathers had once known by manifest and visible evidences; and hence the
   Prophet represents God's going forth from mount Paran as a continued
   act, as though he rendered himself visible chiefly from that place. Nor
   is this representation new; for we see, in many other places, a living
   picture, as it were, set before the eyes of the faithful, in order to
   strengthen them in their adversity, and to make them assured that they
   shall be safe through God's presence. The Lord, indeed, did not daily
   fulminate from heaven, nor were there such visible indications of his
   presence as on mount Sinai; but it behaved the people to feel assured
   that he was the same God who had given to their fathers such clear
   evidence of his power, and that he is also at this time, and to the end
   of the world, endued with the same power, though it be not rendered
   visible.

   We now then apprehend the design of the Prophet: God then came from
   Teman, and the holy one from mount Paran. We must also observe, that
   the minds of the godly were recalled to the spectacle on mount Sinai,
   when they were drawn away into exile, or when they were in the power of
   their enemies. They might indeed have then supposed, that they were
   wholly forsaken. Obliterated then must have been the memory of that
   history, had not this remedy been introduced. It is, therefore, the
   same as though the Prophet had said--"Though God now hides his power,
   and gives no evidence of his favor, yet think not that he formerly
   appeared in vain to your fathers as one clothed with so great a power,
   when the law was proclaimed on mount Sinai. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [52] The word [slh] is found 70 times, as Parkhurst says, in the
   Psalms, and thrice in this chapter. "It was most probably," he adds, "a
   note of music, or a direction to the singers in the temple service to
   raise their voices or instruments where it is inserted." The opinion of
   Gesenius is the same, it being a direction, as he says, "to repeat the
   preceding verse in a louder strain." It is always rendered by the
   Septuagint Diapsalma, which means a variation in singing. Some have
   rendered the word pause, but it cannot be so considered, for it occurs
   at the end of at least three of the Psalms. There seems to be no
   regularity in its adoption in some of the Psalms it occurs once, in
   some twice, in others thrice, and in one psalm four times. Calvin has
   not referred, in his comment, to the latter part of this verse, which,
   according to his Latin, may be thus translated,-- Cover the heavens did
   his glory;
   With his praise full was the earth. Both glory and praise here are to
   be taken as signifying their manifestations. The reference is made to
   the displays of divine majesty on mount Sinai. The original may be thus
   rendered-- Cover the heavens did his shining,
   And his lustre filled the earth. --Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 3:4

   4. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his
   hand: and there was the hiding of his power.

   4. Et splendor quasi lux fuit; cornua e manu ejus ei, et ibi absconsio
   fortitudinis ejus.


   He confirms the declaration which I have explained that God, when he
   intended his presence to be made known to his people, gave evidences of
   his wonderful power, capable of awakening the minds of all. He then
   says, that the brightness was like light. By the word 'vr, aur, is
   doubtless meant the light, which diffuses itself through the whole
   world, and proceeds from the sun. Then he says, that the brightness
   which appeared on mount Sinai was equal to the light of the sun,
   capable of filling the whole world. He adds, that horns were to him
   from the hand. Some render it, splendor; but qrn, coren, properly means
   a horn, and qrnym, corenium, is here in the dual number: it is
   therefore more probable, that the Prophet ascribes horns to God,
   carried in both hands; and it more corresponds with what immediately
   follows, that "there was the hiding of his strength," or that "there
   was his power hidden." They who render the word, splendours, think that
   what had been said is repeated, that is, that the brightness was like
   light; but they are mistaken, for we may collect from the verse that
   two different things are expressed by the Prophet: he first speaks of
   the visible form of God; and then he adds his power, designating it
   metaphorically by horns, which is common in Scripture. Indeed this mode
   of speaking occurs often. He then says, that God came armed with power,
   when he gave the law to his people; for he bore horns in his hands,
   where his strength was hid. [53]

   As to the word hiding, some indeed give this refined view, that God
   then put forth his strength, which was before hidden. But this is a
   very strained explanation. To me it seems evident, that the Prophet in
   the first place says, that God's glory was conspicuous, capable of
   irradiating the whole world like the light of the sun; and he then
   adds, that this splendor was connected with power, for God carried
   horns in both his hands, where his strength was laid: and he says, that
   it was hid, because God did not intend to make known his power
   indiscriminately throughout the world, but peculiarly to his own
   people; as it is also said in Psalm 31:20, that

   "the greatness of his goodness is laid up for the faithful alone,
   who fear and reverence him."

   As then it is said, that the goodness of God is laid up for the
   faithful, for they enjoy it as children and members of the household;
   so also the power of God is said to be laid up, because he testifies
   that he is armed with power to defend his Church, that he may render
   safe the children of Abraham, whom he has taken under his protection.
   It afterwards follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [53] That [qrz] means to irradiate or to shine, is clear from Exodus
   34:29,30,35; "for shine did the skin of his face," [ky qrz vr phnyy].
   Most critics consider that the noun here, though in this sense in no
   other instance, means rays, or beams of light; and this corresponds
   with the description given elsewhere of God's appearance on mount
   Sinai. Drusius, Marckius, Newcome, and Henderson, render it "rays." The
   line then would literally be -- Rays from his hand were to him. or, to
   retain the English idiom. He had rays from his hand. To render the
   line, "Rays streamed from his hand," is to give a paraphrase. The
   objection of Calvin as to the next line, seems not valid; for the
   hiding of strength may refer to the hand, or to the place, Sinai,
   whether we render the previous word, rays or horns;--to the place, if
   we retain our present reading, [zh], "of its strength;" but to the
   hand, if we adopt the reading of many copies, [zv] "of his strength,"
   which is perhaps the most accordant with the passage.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 3:5

   5. Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his
   feet.

   5. Coram facie ejus ambulavit pestis, et egredietur carbo ignitus (vel,
   ustio) ad pedes ejus.


   The Prophet repeats here, that God came armed to defend his people,
   when he went forth from Teman; for he connects with it here the
   deliverance of the people. He does not indeed speak only of the
   promulgation of the law, but encourages all the godly to confidence;
   for God, who had once redeemed their fathers from Egypt, remained ever
   like himself, and was endued with the same power.

   And he says, that before God's face walked the pestilence; this is to
   be referred to the Egyptians; and that ignited coal proceeded from his
   feet. Some render rsph, reshoph, exile; but its etymology requires it
   to be rendered burning or ignited coal, and there is no necessity to
   give it another meaning. [54]

   The import of the whole is--that God had put to flight all the enemies
   of his people; for we know that the Egyptians were smitten with various
   plagues, and that the army of Pharaoh was drowned in the Red Sea.
   Hence, the Prophet says, that God had so appeared from Teman, that the
   pestilence went before him, and then the ignited coal; in short, that
   the pestilence and ignited coal were God's officers, which were ready
   to perform his commands: as when a king or a judge, having attendants,
   commands them to put this man in prison, and to punish another in a
   different way; so the Prophet, giving us a representation of God, says,
   that all kinds of evils were ready to obey his orders, and to destroy
   his and their enemies. He does not then intend here to terrify the
   faithful in mentioning the pestilence and the ignited coal; but, on the
   contrary, to set before their eyes evidences of God's power, by which
   he could deliver them from the hand of their enemies, as he had
   formerly delivered their fathers from Egypt. By God's feet, he then
   means his going forth or his presence; for I do not approve of what
   some have said, that ignited coals followed, when pestilence had
   preceded; for both clauses are given in the same way. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [54] Most agree in the view given of this verse, only there is some
   shade of difference as to the word [rsph]; but though Calvin renders it
   carbo ignitus--ignited coals, yet in his exposition he seems to regard
   it with many others as a burning disease. In the six other instances in
   which the word occurs, it certainly has not this sense, except it be in
   Deuteronomy 32:24, which is doubtful. It signifies not a burning coal,
   but a glowing fire, burning or lightening. Compare Exodus 9:23,25, with
   Psalm 78:48; where it designates the fires or lightnings produced by
   thunder, which accompanied the hail. Lightning would be its most proper
   rendering here; for instead of referring this verse to the plagues in
   Egypt, it may be considered as a continuation of what is contained in
   the foregoing verse; and the Septuagint and Theodotion have rendered
   [dvr] in the preceding clause, not pestilence, but word--logos, its
   most usual meaning. This makes the whole to comport to what we read of
   God's appearance on mount Sinai. See Exodus 19:16; Deuteronomy 33:2.
   The version then would be this-- From before him proceeded the word
   (i.e. the law;)
   And forth came lightning at his feet. Most of the ideas in this, and in
   the two preceding verses, seem to be similar to those we find in
   Deuteronomy 33:2,3.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 3:6

   6. He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the
   nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual
   hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.

   6. Stetit et mensus est terram; aspexit et dissolvit gentes; et
   afflicti sunt montes aeterni; incurvati sunt colles seculi; itinera
   seculi ei.


   He says that God possessed every power to subdue the earth to himself,
   and that he could at his will destroy it, yea, dissolve mountains as
   veil as nations. Some of the Jews understood this of the ark, which
   stood at that time in Gilead. They then suppose that the Prophet meant
   this in short--that when God chose a place for the ark of the covenant
   in Gilgal, that he determined then what he would do, and that he then
   in his secret counsel divided the land, so that each should have his
   portion by lot. This, it is true, was accomplished shortly after, for
   Joshua, as we know, divided it by lot between the tribes. But what the
   Jews affirm of the ark seems to me strained and frigid. Habakkuk, on
   the contrary, means by the word stand, that God was openly conspicuous,
   like him who assumes an erect posture, so that he is seen at a
   distance. In this sense we are to take the expression that God stood.

   The measuring, of the earth is not to be confined to Judea, but is to
   be extended to the whole world. God, he says, has measured the earth.
   To measure the earth is what properly belongs to a sovereign king; and
   it is done that he may assign to each his portion. Except God, then,
   had a sovereign right over the earth and the whole world, Habakkuk
   would not have ascribed to him this office; and this we learn from the
   verse itself, for he immediately subjoins, that the nations, as it
   were, melted away, that the mountains were destroyed, that the hills
   were bowed down

   We hence see that by earth we are not to understand Judea only, but the
   whole world; as though he had said, that when God appeared on mount
   Sinai, he made it fully evident that the earth was under his power and
   authority, so that he could determine whatever he pleased, and
   prescribe limits to all nations. For he does not speak of God here as
   having, like a surveyor, a measuring line; but he says, that he
   measured the earth as one capable even then of changing the boundaries
   of the whole world; nay, he intimates that it was he himself who had at
   first created the earth and assigned it to men. It is indeed true that
   the nations did not then melt away, nor were the mountains demolished,
   nor the hills bowed down; but the Prophet simply means, that God's
   power then appeared, which was capable of shaking the whole world.

   But he calls these the mountains of eternity and the hills ages, which
   had been from the beginning fixed on their own foundations. For if an
   earthquake happens on a plain, it seems less wonderful; and then if any
   of those mountains cleave, which are not so firmly fixed, it may be on
   account of some hollow places; for when the winds fill the caverns,
   they are forced to burst, and they cleave the mountains and the earth.
   But the Prophet relates an unusual thing, and wholly different from the
   ordinary course of nature--that the mountains of eternity, which had
   been from the beginning, and had remained without any change, were thus
   demolished and bowed down. In short, the Prophet intended by all means
   to raise up to confidence the minds of the godly, so that they should
   become fully persuaded that God's power to deliver them would be the
   same as that which their fathers had formerly experienced; for there is
   no other support under adverse, and especially under despairing
   circumstances, than that the faithful should know that they are still
   under the protection of that God who has adopted them. This is the
   reason why the Prophet amplifies, in so striking a manner, on the
   subject of God's power.

   And hence also he subjoins, that the ways of ages are those of God.
   Some render the clause, "the ways of the world." The word vlm, oulam,
   however, means properly an age, or perpetual time. The Prophet, I have
   no doubt, means by ways of ages, the wonderful means which God is wont
   to adopt for the defense of his Church; for we are ever wont to reduce
   God's wonder to our own understanding, while it is his purpose to
   perfect, in a manner that is wonderful, the work of our salvation.
   Hence the Prophet bids the faithful here to raise upwards their
   thoughts, and to conceive something greater of God's power than what
   they can naturally comprehend. If we take the ways of eternity, in this
   sense, then they are to be understood as in opposition to those means
   which are known and usual. They are his daily ways, when the sun rises
   and sets, when the spring succeeds the winter, when the earth produces
   fruit; though even these are so many miracles, yet they are his common
   ways. But God has ways of eternity that is he has means unknown to us
   by which he can deliver us from death, whenever it may please him.

   But yet, if any prefer taking the ways of eternity as signifying the
   continued power of God, which has ever appeared from the beginning, the
   sense would be appropriate and not less useful: for it especially
   avails to confirm our faith, when we consider that God's power has ever
   been the same from the creation of heaven and earth, that it has never
   been lessened or undergone any change. Since, then, God has
   successively manifested his power through all ages, we ought hence to
   learn that we have no reason to despair, though he may for a time
   conceal his hand; for he is not on that account deprived of his right.
   He ever retains the sovereignty of the world. We ought, then, to be
   attentive to the ways of ages, that is, to the demonstration of that
   power, which was manifested in the creation of the world, and still
   continues to be manifested. [55] It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [55] This verse is explained in a very striking manner, but the version
   is not so strictly correct It may be thus rendered:-- 6. He stood, and
   measured the earth;
   He looked, and agitated the earth;
   And burst themselves open did the perpetual mountains,
   Bend down did the hills of ages;
   The going of ages were his. "The perpetual mountains" are literally
   "the mountains of perpetuity," which had remained the same from the
   beginning. "The hills of ages" might be rendered the hills of antiquity
   or of old time, [vlm], an indefinite past time. "The goings of ages,"
   are God's proceedings, that is, in his works, and may therefore be
   rendered "deeds;" and they are said to be deeds "of ages," i.e., of old
   time, with reference probably to the creation of the world: for he who
   makes perennial mountains to burst, and perpetual hills to bend
   downwards, must be their first creator.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 3:7

   7. I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the
   land of Midian did tremble.

   7. Pro iniquitate (vel, pro nihilo, alii vertunt) vidi tentoria Cushan
   (vel, Aethiopiae;) contremiscent cortinae (vel, pelles) terrae Midian.


   The Prophet relates here, no doubt, whatever might bring comfort to the
   miserable Jews, as they thought themselves rejected and in a manner
   alienated from God. Hence the Prophet mentions here other deliverances,
   which were clear evidences of God's constant favor towards his chosen
   people. He had hitherto spoken of their redemption, and he will
   presently return to the same subject: but he introduces here other
   histories; as though he had said, that it was not only at one time that
   God had testified how much he loved the race of Abraham, and how
   inviolable was the covenant he had made; but that he had given the same
   testimonies at various times: for as he had also defended his people
   against other enemies, the conclusion was obvious, that God's hand was
   thus made manifest, that the children of Abraham might know that they
   were not deceived, when they were adopted by him.

   Hence Habakkuk mentions the tents of Cushan as another evidence of
   God's power in preserving his people, and the curtains of Midian; for
   we know how wonderful was the work, when the Jews were delivered by the
   hand of Gideon; and the same was the case with respect to the king of
   Chosen.

   We now, then, understand the design of the Prophet: for as he knew that
   the time was near when the Jews might succumb to despair in their great
   adversities, he reminds them of the evidences of God's favor and power,
   which had been given to their fathers, that they might entertain firm
   hope in time to come, and be fully persuaded that God would be their
   deliverer, as he had been formerly to their fathers.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we have a continual contest with powerful
   enemies, we may know that we are defended by thine hand, and that even
   thou art fighting for us when we are at rest; so that we may boldly
   contend under thy protection, and never be wearied, nor yield to Satan
   and the wicked, or to any temptations; but firmly proceed in the course
   of our warfare: and however much thou mayest often humble us, so as to
   make us to tremble under thine awful judgement, may we yet never cease
   to entertain firm hope, since thou hast once promised to be to us an
   eternal Father in thine eternal and only-begotten Son, but being
   confirmed by the invincible constancy of faith, may we so submit
   ourselves to thee, as to bear all our afflictions patiently, till thou
   gatherest us at length into that blessed rest, which has been procured
   for us by the blood of thine own Son. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Sixteenth

   We said yesterday that the Prophet spoke of the king of Cushan and of
   the Midianites, in order to strengthen the minds of the godly, and to
   set before their eyes the continued aid of God, so that they might
   venture to feel assured that he would not act otherwise towards the
   Church to the end of the world, then what he had done from the
   beginning. The meaning, then, is sufficiently evident. We must now
   consider the words.

   Some understand by the word, 'vn, aun, nothing, or vanity; as though
   the Prophet had said, that the tells of Cushan had been reduced to
   nothing: but another sense is more probable; I have seen the tents of
   Cushan on account of his iniquity; [56] that is, the reward which God
   had repaid, for the iniquity of the king of Cushan had been made
   manifest. The Prophet says that he had seen it, because it was evident
   and known to all. We now perceive what is meant that God had been a
   just judge against the army of Cushan; for as they had unjustly
   assailed the Israelites, so a just reward was rendered to them. The
   account of this we have in Judges 3. Cushan, the king of Mesopotamia,
   had well-nigh destroyed the Israelites, when the Lord put him to flight
   with all his forces. Some render the words, "The tents of Ethiopia," as
   though it was written thus; but this is strained, and contrary to the
   rules of grammar; and besides, the following clause confirms what I
   have said; for the Prophet mentions the slaughter with which God
   destroyed the Midianites, who had also nearly overwhelmed the miserable
   people. He says that their curtains trembled, or their dwellings: for
   God, without the hand or sword of men, drove them into such madness,
   that they slew one another, as the sacred history testifies. See Judges
   6:1, 7:1. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [56] The word ['vz] not only means iniquity, but also what iniquity
   produces, labor, trouble, affliction; and this latter meaning, as
   allowed by Newcome and Henderson, is most suitable to it here. The word
   is so taken in Genesis 35:18; Deuteronomy 26:14; Hosea 9:4. Besides,
   this meaning makes a correspondence between this and the following
   line, as will be seen by the following version-- Under trouble have I
   seen the tents of Cushan,
   Tremble did the curtains of the land of Midian. The "curtains" were
   those used in forming tents, and are used here to designate them. The
   most obvious reference here is to Cushan, mentioned in Judges 3:8,10,
   as Calvin states; yet some consider that it stands for Cush, as Lotan,
   in Genesis 26:20, is put for Lot: and some, as Gesenius, say, that the
   African Cush is meant, and others, as Henderson, think, that it is the
   Arabian Cush, especially as Midian is also mentioned. Still the events
   recorded in Judges, nearly connected together, favor the opinion
   adopted by Calvin.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 3:8

   8. Was the Lord displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against
   the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon
   thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?

   8. An contra fluvios iratus es, Jehova? an contra fluvios indignatio
   tua? an contra mare furor tuus (vel, ira tua)? quia equitasti super
   equos tuos; quadridge tuae salus.


   The Prophet here applies the histories to which he has already
   referred, for the purpose of strengthening the hope of the faithful; so
   that they might know these to be so many proofs and pledges of God's
   favor towards them, and that they might thus cheerfully look for his
   aid, and not succumb to temptation in their adversities. When he asks,
   was God angry with the rivers and the sea, he no doubt intended in this
   way to awaken the thoughts of the faithful, that they might consider
   the design of God in the works which he had already mentioned; for it
   would have been unreasonable that God should show his wrath against
   rivers and the sea; why should he be angry with lifeless elements? The
   Prophet then shows that God had another end in view when he dried the
   sea, when he stopped the course of Jordan, and when he gave other
   evidences of his power. Doubtless God did not regard the sea and the
   rivers; for that would have been unreasonable. It then follows that
   these changes were testimonies of God's favor towards his Church: and
   hence the Prophet subjoins, that God rode on his horses, and that his
   chariots were for salvation to his people. [57] We now perceive the
   Prophet's meaning, which interpreters have not understood, or at least
   have not explained.

   We now, then, see why the Prophet puts these questions: and a question
   has much more force when it refers to what is in no way doubtful. What!
   can God be angry with rivers? Who can imagine God to be so unreasonable
   as to disturb the sea and to change the nature of things, when a
   certain order has been established by his own command? Why should he
   dry the sea, except he had something in view, even the deliverance of
   his Church? except he intended to save his people from extreme danger,
   by stretching forth his hand to the Israelites, when they thought
   themselves utterly lost? He therefore denies, that when God dried the
   Red Sea, and when he stopped the flowing of Jordan, he had put forth
   his power against the sea or against the river, as though he was angry
   with them. The design of God, says the Prophet, was quite another; for
   God rode on his horses, that is, he intended to show that all the
   elements were under his command, and that for the salvation of his
   people. That God, then, might be the redeemer of his Church, he
   constrained Jordan to turn back its course, he constrained the Red Sea
   to make a passage for his miserable captives, who would have otherwise
   been exposed to the slaughter of their enemies. There was indeed no
   hope of saving Israel, without a passage being suddenly opened to them
   through the Red Sea.

   Hence all these miracles were designed to show that God had become the
   redeemer of his Church, and had put forth his power for the salvation
   of those whom he had taken under his protection: and it is easy from
   this fact to conclude, that the same help ought to be expected from God
   by posterity; for God was not induced by some sudden impulse to change
   the nature of things, but exhibited a proof of his favor: and his grace
   is perpetual, and flows in an even course, though not according to the
   apprehension of men; for it suffers some interruptions, because God
   exercises the faithful under the cross; yet his goodness never ceases.
   It hence follows that the faithful are to entertain hope; for God, when
   he pleases, and when he sees it expedient, will really show the same
   power which was formerly exhibited to the fathers. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [57] The two first lines present a difficulty in their construction.
   The most literal is this rendering of Junius-- Did against rivers
   kindle, O Jehovah --
   Against rivers, thy wrath; Our language will admit of a similar
   construction in another form, by inverting the order-- Did thy wrath
   against rivers, O Jehovah,
   Did it kindle against rivers? Some connect the two last lines of the
   verse with the previous one, thus-- Was thine indignation against the
   sea,
   When thou didst ride on thy horses,
   On thy chariots of salvation? But Calvin considers them rather as an
   answer to the previous questions, or as explanatory; and they may be
   thus rendered-- When thou didst ride on thy horses,
   Thy chariots were those of salvation. It is observed by Henderson, that
   "there is no necessity for our understanding either the angels or
   thunder and lightning by horses' and chariots.' They are," he adds,
   "merely figurative expressions, designed to carry out the metaphor
   adopted from military operations." Or it may be, that the horses and
   chariots of the Israelites are here meant, as in the 11th verse, the
   arrows and spears of the people are spoken of as those of God.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 3:9

   9. Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes,
   even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.

   9. Nudando nudatus fuit (vel, manifestatione manifestus fuit) arcus
   tuus; juramenta Tribuum, sermo: Selach: fluviis scindes terram.


   The Prophet explains the same thing more clearly in this verse--that
   the power of God was formerly manifested for no other reason but that
   the children of Abraham might be taught to expect from him a continued
   deliverance: for he says that the bow of God was made bare. By the bow,
   he means also the sword and other weapons; as though he had said, that
   God was then armed, as we have found declared before. God therefore was
   then furnished with weapons, and marched to the battle, having
   undertaken the cause of his chosen people, that he might defend them
   against the wicked. Since it was so, we hence see that these miracles
   were not to avail only for one period, but were intended perpetually to
   encourage the faithful to look ever for the aid of God, even in the
   midst of death; for he can find escapes, though they may not appear to
   us.

   We now see the import of the text; but he emphatically adds, The oaths
   of the tribes; for hereby he more fully confirms that God had not then
   assisted the children of Abraham, so as to discard them afterwards; but
   that he had really proved how true he was in his promises; for by the
   oaths of (or to) the tribes he means the covenant that God had made not
   only with Abraham, but also with his posterity for ever. He puts oaths
   in the plural number, because God had not only once promised to be a
   God to Abraham and to his seed, but had often repeated the same
   promise, in order that faith might be rendered more certain, inasmuch
   as we have need of more than one thing to confirm us. For we see how
   our infirmity always vacillates, unless God supplies us with many
   props. As, then, God had often confirmed his servant Abraham, the
   Prophet speaks here of his oaths: but then as to the substance, the
   oath of God is the same; which was, that he had taken the race of
   Abraham under his protection, and promised that they should be to him a
   peculiar people, and, especially, that he had united the people under
   one head; for except Christ had been introduced, that covenant of God
   would not have been ratified nor valid. As, then, God had once included
   every thing when he said to Abraham, "I am God Almighty, and I shall be
   a God to you and to your children;" it is certain that nothing was
   added when God afterwards confirmed the faith of Abraham: but yet the
   Prophet does not without reason use the plural number; it was done,
   that the faithful might recomb with less fear on God's promise, seeing,
   that it had been so often and by so many words confirmed.

   He calls them too the oaths to the tribes: for though God had spoken to
   Abraham and afterwards to Moses, yet the promise was deposited in the
   hands of Abraham, and of the patriarchs, and afterwards in those of
   Moses, that the people might understand that it belonged equally to
   them; for it would have been no great matter to promise what we read of
   to a few men only. But Abraham was as it were the depository; and it
   was a certain solemn stipulation made with his whole race. We hence see
   why the Prophet here mentions the tribes rather than Abraham, or the
   patriarchs or Moses. He had indeed a special regard to those of his own
   time, in order to confirm them, that they might not doubt but that God
   would extend to them also the same power. How so? Because God had
   formerly wrought in a wonderful manner for the deliverance of his
   people. Why? That he might prove himself to be true and faithful. In
   what respect? Because he had said, that he would be the protector of
   his people; and he did not adopt a few men only, but the whole race of
   Abraham. Since it was so, why should not his posterity hope for that
   which they knew was promised to their fathers? for the truth of God can
   never fail. Though many ages had passed away, the faith of his people
   ought to have remained certain, for God intended to show himself to be
   the same as he had been formerly known by their fathers.

   He afterwards adds 'mr, amer, which means a word or speech; but it is
   to be taken here for a fixed and an irrevocable word. The word, 'mr,
   amer, he says; that is, as they say, the word and the deed: for when we
   say, that words are given, we often understand that those who liberally
   promise are false men, and that we are only trifled with and
   disappointed when we place confidence in them. But the term, word, is
   sometimes taken in a good sense. "This is the word," we often say, when
   we intend to remove every doubt. We now then perceive what the Prophet
   meant by adding 'mr, amer, the word. "O Lord, thou hast not given mere
   words to a people; but what has proceeded from thy mouth has been found
   to be true and valid. Such, therefore, is and faithfulness in thy
   promises, that we ought not to entertain the least doubt as to the
   event. As soon as thou givest to us any hope, we ought to feel assured
   of its accomplishment, as though it were not a word but the exhibition
   of the thing itself." In short, by this term the Prophet commends the
   faithfulness of God, lest we should harbour doubts as to his promises.
   [58]

   He then says, that by rivers had been cleft the earth. He refers, I
   doubt not, to the history we read in Numbers 14; for the Lord, when the
   people were nearly dead through thirst, drew forth water from the rock,
   and caused a river to flow wherever the people journeyed. As then he
   had cleft the earth to make a perpetual course for the stream, and thus
   supplied the people in dry places with abundance of water, the Prophet
   says here, that the earth had been cleft by rivers or streams. It was
   indeed but one river; but he amplifies, and justly so, that remarkable
   work of God. He afterwards adds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [58] This clause has been variously explained: the interpretation here
   given has been mostly adopted. In the Barberinean manuscript the whole
   of this prayer is given in many respects different from the present
   received text of the Septuagint, and this clause is thus found in
   it--echortasas bolidas tes pharetras autou. It is evident that this
   idea falls in more with the preceding clause than any other; and the
   Hebrew will admit of a sense bordering on this with less alteration
   than any other that has been offered. No version has been given without
   supposing something to be understood. Newcome says, that sixteen MSS.
   read [svvt]; by leaving out the [v], it may be a verb in Kal in the
   past tense, as rendered above, and writers might have easily put down
   ['mr] for ['zvr]. Then the line in Hebrew would be, [svt mtvt 'zvr]
   "Thou hast filled with arrows the girdle." It is a description of one
   equipped for battle; his bow was made ready, and he had filled his
   girdle, that is, his military guide, with arrows; for this girdle the
   preceding Greek version introduced the quiver, in which arrows were
   commonly carried. The word [mtvt], means rods or staves, that is, of
   arrows, as we may take it here. This is the most satisfactory solution
   of the difficulties connected with this line, of which there have been,
   as Henderson says, more than a hundred interpretations. The last clause
   of the verse is thus rendered by Newcome,-- Thou didst cleave the
   streams of the land; and by Henderson,-- Thou didst cleave the earth
   into rivers. The words will not admit the first version; the genitive
   case in Hebrew is always by juxtaposition; here "streams" and "earth"
   are separated by the verb. The other version contains hardly a meaning.
   The most literal rendering is that given by Calvin, and it affords the
   best sense. The words will admit of the following, which is materially
   the same,-- By streams didst thou cleavest the earth. The allusion
   evidently to the streams of that water which miraculously issued from
   the smitten rock, and followed the Israelites in the wilderness.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 3:10

   10. The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the
   water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on
   high.

   10. Viderunt me, timuerunt montes; inundatio (vel, gurges) aquarum
   transivit; dedit abyssus vocen suam; in altum manus suas sustulit (vel,
   altitudo, [mvr]; potest tam in casu nominandi legi quam in accusative.)


   Habakkuk proceeds with the history of the people's redemption. We have
   said what his object was, even this that the people, though in an
   extreme state of calamity, might yet entertain hope of God's favor; for
   he became not a Redeemer to the race of Abraham for one time, but that
   he might continue the same favor to them to the end.

   He says that mountains had seen and grieved. Some explain this
   allegorically of kings, and say, that they grieved when envy preyed on
   them: but this view is too strained. The Prophet, I have no doubt,
   means simply, that the mountains obeyed God, so as to open a way for
   his people. At the same time, the verb chvl, chul, signifies not only
   to grieve, but also to bring forth, and then to fall and to abide in
   the same place. We might then with no less propriety read thus--see
   thee did the mountains, and were still, or fell down; that is, they
   were subservient to thy command, and did not intercept the way of thy
   people. I think the real meaning of the Prophet to be, that God had
   formerly imprinted on all the elements evident marks of his paternal
   favor, so that the posterity of Abraham might ever confide in him as
   their deliverer in all their distresses: and even the context requires
   this meaning; for he subjoins -

   The stream or the inundation of waters, etc.: and this second part
   cannot be explained allegorically. We then see, that the import of the
   words is--That God removed all obstacles, so that neither mountains,
   nor waters, nor sea, nor rivers, intercepted the passage of the people.
   He says now, that the inundation of waters had passed away. This
   applies both to Jordan and to the Red Sea; for God separated the Red
   Sea, so that the waters stood apart, contrary to the laws of nature,
   and the same thing happened to Jordan; for the flowing of the water was
   stayed, and a way was opened, so that the people passed over dryshod
   into the land of Canaan. Thus took place what is said by the Prophet,
   the stream of waters passed away. We indeed know that such is the
   abundance of waters in the sea and in the rivers, that they cannot be
   dried up: when therefore waters disappear, it is what is beyond the
   course of nature. The Prophet, therefore, records this miracle, that
   the faithful might know, that though the whole world were resisting,
   their salvation would still be certain; for the Lord can surmount
   whatever impediments there may be.

   He then ascribes life to waters; for he says, that the abyss gave its
   voice, and also, that the deep lifted up its hands; or that the abyss
   with uplifted hands was ready to obey God. It is a striking
   personification; for though the abyss is void of intelligence, and it
   cannot speak, yet the Prophet says, that the abyss with its voice and
   uplifted hands testified its obedience, when God would have his people
   to pass through to the promised land. When anxious to testify our
   obedience, we do this both with our voice and in our gesture. When any
   one is willing to do what is commanded, he says, "Here I am," or "I
   promise to do this." As, then, servants respond to others, so the
   Prophet says, that a voice was uttered by the abyss. The abyss indeed
   uttered no voice; but the event itself surpassed all voices. Now when a
   whole people meet together, they raise their hands; for their consent
   cannot be understood except by the outstretching of the hands, and
   hence came the word hand-extending, cheirotonia. This similitude the
   Prophet now takes, and says, that the abyss raised up its hands; that
   is, shows its consent by this gesture. As when men declare by this sign
   that they will do what they are bidden; so also the abyss lifted up its
   hands. If we read, The deep raised up its hands, the sense will be the
   same. [59] Let us proceed -
     __________________________________________________________________

   [59] Most critics have overlooked the peculiar construction of this
   verse; but it presents a striking instant of the order in which the
   Prophets often arrange their ideas. There are two things referred
   to--the mountains and the waters--and the first verb regards both; the
   nominative case being anticipated, and the first of the two last lines
   refers to the waters, and the last to the mountains. This is the
   literal version,-- They saw thee, -- in pain were the mountains,
   The flood of waters passed away,
   Utter did the deep its voice,
   The height its hands lifted up. To construe [rvm] adverbially, "on
   high," does not so well comport with the characters of the Hebrew
   language; and it evidently here refers to the "mountains," as the
   "deep" refers to the water.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 3:11

   11. The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of
   thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.

   11. Sol, luna stetit in habitaculo, ad lucem sagittarum tuarum
   ambulabunt, ad splendorum fulguris hastae tuae.


   Here the Prophet refers to another history; for we know that when
   Joshua fought, and when the day was not long enough to slay the
   enemies, the day was prolonged according to his prayer, (Joshua 10:12.)
   He seems indeed to have authoritatively commanded the sun to stay its
   course: but there is no doubt, but that having been answered as to his
   prayer, when he expressed this, he commanded the sun, as he did,
   through the secret impulse of the Holy Spirit: and we know that the sun
   would not have stopped in its course, except the moon also was stayed.
   There must indeed have been the same action as to these two luminaries.

   Hence Habakkuk says, that the sun and moon stood still in their
   habitation; that is, that the sun then rested as it were in its
   dwelling. When it was hastening in its course, it then stood still for
   the benefit of God's people. The sun then and the moon stood,--How? At
   the light of thy arrows shall they walk. Some refer this to the pillar
   of fire, as though the Prophet had said, that the Israelites walked by
   that light, by which God guided them: but I doubt not but that this is
   said of the sun. The whole sentence is thus connected--that the sun and
   moon walked, not as from the beginning, but at the light of God's
   arrows; that is, when instead of God's command, which the sun had
   received from the beginning as its direction, the sun had God's arrows,
   which guided it, retarded its course, or restrained the velocity which
   it had before. There is then an implied contrast between the progress
   of the sun which it had by nature to that day, and that new direction,
   when the sun was retained, that it might give place to the arrows of
   God, and to the sword and the spear; for by the arrows and the spear he
   means nothing else but the weapons of the elect people; for we know,
   that when that people fought under the protection of God, they were
   armed as it were from above. As then it is said of Gideon, "The sword
   of God and of Gideon;" so also in this place the Prophet calls whatever
   armor the people of Israel had, the arrows of God and his spear; for
   that people could not move--no, not a finger's breadth--without the
   command of God. The sun then was wont before to regard the ordinary
   command, of which we read in Genesis; but it was then directed for
   another purpose: for it had regard to the arrows of God flying on the
   earth as lightning; and it had regard to the arrows, as though it stood
   astonished and dared not to advance. Why? because it behoved it to
   submit to God while he was carrying on war. [60] We now then perceive
   how much kindness is included in these words.

   What, therefore, we have already referred to, ought to be borne in
   mind--that in this place there is no frigid narrative, but such things
   are brought before the faithful as avail to confirm their hope, that
   they may feel assured, that the power of God is sufficient for the
   purpose of delivering them; for it was for this end that he formerly
   wrought so many miracles. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [60] There is much beauty and force in this explanation: and accordant
   with it is the version of Henderson. But that of Newcome is somewhat
   different-- The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation:
   By their light thine arrows went abroad;
   By their brightness, the lightning of thy spear. To avoid the insertion
   of so many words in italics which are not in the original, I would
   render the verse thus-- The sun! the moon! -- it stood -- she remained
   stationary,
   For light to thine arrows which went forth,
   For brightness to the flashing of thy spear. The genitive case is often
   to be rendered as a dative, as in Jeremiah 31:35, [l'vr lylh], "for the
   light of the night;" that is, "for light to the night." There are
   twelve MSS. which have "and," [v], before "moon:" but it is not wanted,
   the verb "stood" being singular; and it is followed, as I conceive, by
   another verb in the singular number, and in the feminine gender, while
   "stood" is in the masculine, and refers to the moon, and the last
   refers to the sun; which is sometimes feminine, while moon is ever the
   masculine. The verb [zvl] is not properly to dwell, but to continue
   fixed, or to remain stationary. The order in our language would be
   this-- The sun remained stationary, the moon stood. --Ed.

   Habakkuk 3:12

   12. Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh
   the heathen in anger.

   12. In ira calcasti terram (vel, ambulasti super terram; [dts] enim
   significat ambulare;) in ira (est tamen aliud nomen, ergo vertamus uno
   loco, indignationem, vel, furorem,--in furore) triturasti gentes (vel,
   triturabis.)


   The Prophet relates here the entrance of the people into the land of
   Canaan, that the faithful might know that their fathers would not have
   obtained so many victories had not God put forth the power and strength
   of his hand. Hence he says, that God himself had trampled on the land
   in anger. For how could the Israelites have dared to attack so many
   nations, who had lately come forth from so miserable a bondage? They
   had indeed been in the desert for forty years; but they were always
   trembling and fearful, and we also know that they were weak and feeble.
   How then was it, that they overcame most powerful kings? that they made
   war with nations accustomed to war? Doubtless God himself trod down the
   land in his wrath, and also threshed the nations: as it is said in
   Psalm 44:5,

   "It was not by their own sword that they got the land of Canaan;
   neither their own power, nor their own hand saved them; but the Lord
   showed favor to them, and became their Deliverer."

   Justly then does the Prophet ascribe this to God, that he himself
   walked over the land; for otherwise the Israelites would never have
   dared to move a foot. Doubtless, they could never have been settled in
   that land, had not God gone before them. Hence when God did tread on
   the land in his anger, then it became a quiet habitation to the
   children of Abraham; warlike nations were then easily and without much
   trouble conquered by the Israelites, though they were previously very
   weak.

   We now see, that the Prophet sets forth here before the eyes of the
   people their entrance into the land, that they might know that God did
   not in vain put to flight so many nations at one time; but that the
   land of Canaan might be the perpetual inheritance of his chosen people.

   The Prophet changes often the tenses of the verbs, inconsistently with
   the common usage of the Hebrew language; but it must be observed, that
   he so refers to those histories, as though God were continually
   carrying on his operations; and as though his presence was to be looked
   for in adversities, the same as what he had granted formerly to the
   fathers. Hence the change of tenses does not obscure the sense, but, on
   the contrary, shows to us the design of the Prophet, and helps us to
   understand the meaning. It follows at length -
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 3:13

   13. Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
   salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house
   of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.

   13. Egressus es in salutem populi tui, in salutem cum Christo tuo;
   transfodisti caput e domo impii, nudando fundamentum usque ad collum.
   Selah.


   The Prophet applies again to the present state of the people what he
   had before recorded--that God went forth with his Christ for the
   salvation of his people. Some consider that there is understood a
   particle of comparison, and repeat the verb twice, "As thou didst then
   go forth for the deliverance of thy people, so now wilt thou go forth
   for the deliverance of thy people with thy Christ." But this repetition
   is strained. I therefore take the words of the Prophet simply as they
   are--that God went forth for the deliverance of his people. But when
   God's people are spoken of, their gratuitous adoption must ever be
   remembered. How was it that the children of Abraham became the peculiar
   people of God? Did this proceed from any worthiness? Did it come to
   them naturally? None of these things can be alleged. Though then they
   differed in nothing from other nations, yet God was pleased to choose
   them to be a people to himself. By the title, the people of God, is
   therefore intimated their adoption. Now this adoption was not temporary
   or momentary, but was to continue to the end. Hence it was easy for the
   faithful to draw this conclusion--that they were to hope from God the
   same help as what he had formerly granted to the fathers.

   Thou wentest forth, he says, for the salvation, for the salvation of
   thy people. He repeats the word salvation, and not without reason; for
   he wished to call attention to this point, as when he had said
   before--that God had not in vain manifested, by so many miracles, his
   power, as though he were angry with the sea and with rivers, but had
   respect to the preservation of his people. Since then the salvation of
   the Church has ever been the design of God in working miracles, why
   should the faithful be now cast down, when for a time they were
   oppressed by adversities? for God ever remains the same: and why should
   they despond, especially since that ancient deliverance, and also those
   many deliverances, of which he had hitherto spoken, are so many
   evidences of his everlasting covenant. These indeed ought to be
   connected with the word of God; that is, with that promise, according
   to which he had received the children of Abraham into favor for the
   purpose of protecting them to the end. "For salvation, for salvation,"
   says the Prophet, and that of his elect people.

   He adds, with thy Christ. This clause still more confirms what Habakkuk
   had in view--that God had been from the beginning the deliverer of his
   people in the person of the Mediator. When God, therefore, delivered
   his people from the hand of Pharaoh, when he made a way for them to
   pass through the Red Sea, when he redeemed them by doing wonders, when
   he subdued before them the most powerful nations, when he changed the
   laws of nature in their behalf--all these things he did through the
   Mediator. For God could never have been propitious either to Abraham
   himself or to his posterity, had it not been for the intervention of a
   Mediator. Since then it has ever been the office of the Mediator to
   preserve in safety the Church of God, the Prophet takes it now for
   granted, that Christ was now manifested in much clearer light than
   formerly; for David was his lively image, as well as his successors.
   God then gave a living representation of his Christ when he erected a
   kingdom in the person of David; and he promised that this kingdom
   should endure as long as the sun and moon should shine in the heavens.
   Since, then, there were in the time of Habakkuk clearer prophecies than
   in past times respecting the eternity of this kingdom, ought not the
   people to have taken courage, and to have known of a certainty that God
   would be their Deliverer, when Christ should come? We now then
   apprehend the meaning of the Prophet. [61] But I cannot now go farther;
   I shall defer the subject until tomorrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [61] However true is what is said here, it seems not to be the doctrine
   of this text. The version of Aquila and the Vulgate have been followed
   as to the second clause of the verse. The Septuagint read, tou sosai
   ton christon sou-- to save thy Christ;" or, according to Alex. cod.,
   "thy Christs--tous christous sou;" or, according to Barb. MS., "thine
   elect--tous eklektous sou." Five Hebrew MSS. have [msychyd], "thine
   anointed ones." But if "people" in the preceding line; or it may refer
   to Joshua and his successors, the singular being used, as it is often
   done by the Prophets, in the collective sense. The particle ['t] before
   it is not often used as a preposition; and the word [ys] may better be
   taken here as a verb, according to the Septuagint, than as a noun,
   though as a verb it most commonly occurs in Hiphil: but see 1 Samuel
   23:5; 2 Samuel 8:6. The following would then be the version-- Go forth
   didst thou to save thy people,
   To save thine anointed:
   Thou didst smite the head from the house of the wicked,
   Emptying out the foundation even to the neck. The reference in the two
   lines is evidently to the rooting out of the Canaanites, and not, as
   Newcome thinks, to the destruction of the firstborn in Egypt. The
   singular is poetically used for the plural: "head," instead of heads,
   or chiefs, etc. The last line seems to be a proverbial saying,
   signifying an entire demolition, the very foundation being dug up,
   though so deep as to reach up to man's neck. There is no MSS. nor
   version to countenance [tsvr], "rock," which Houbigant and Newcome
   adopt.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast so often and in such various
   ways testified formerly how much care and solicitude thou hast for the
   salvation of those who rely and call on thee,--O grant, that we at this
   day may experience the same: and though thy face is justly hid from us,
   may we yet never hesitate to flee to thee, since thou hast made a
   covenant through thy Son, which is founded in thine infinite mercy.
   Grant then, that we, being humbled in true penitence, may so surrender
   ourselves to thy Son, that we may be led to thee, and find thee to be
   no less a Father to us than to the faithful of old, as thou everywhere
   testifies to us in thy word, until at length being freed from all
   troubles and dangers, we come to that blessed rest which thy Son has
   purchased for us by his own blood. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Seventeenth

   We explained yesterday why the Prophet says that God went forth for the
   salvation of the elect people with his Christ. His purpose was to
   confirm still more the faithful in the hope of their deliverance; for
   God is not only the same, and never changes his purpose, but the same
   Mediator also performs his office, through whom the people were
   formerly preserved. We must also notice this difference, to which I
   referred yesterday; for as God had then more clearly manifested Christ,
   with more cheerfulness it behaved the faithful to go on, as they had so
   remarkable a pledge of God's favor, inasmuch as God had promised that
   the kingdom of God would be for ever.

   He adds, that wounded was the head from the house of the wicked; that
   is, that there was no power which had not been laid prostrate by God
   for the sake of his people; and we know that all the great kings were
   formerly destroyed, in order that favor might be shown to God's people.
   The other comparison seems different, and yet its object is the
   same--that God had made bare the foundation to the neck; that is, that
   he had destroyed from the roots his enemies; for by foundation he
   means, in a metaphorical sense, whatever stability there was in these
   enemies, and that this was torn up and overthrown to the very neck,
   that is, to the very summit; for the body of men, we know, is covered
   from the neck to the feet. And he says that their houses, that is their
   families, were made bare to the neck, for the Lord had destroyed them
   all from the bottom to the top. We now understand what the Prophet
   meant.

   As to the word slh, selah, I have hitherto said nothing; but I shall
   now briefly refer to what the Hebrew interpreters think. Some explain
   it by lvlm, laoulam, "for ever;" and by d vd, od uod, "yet and yet;" as
   though, when this word is inserted, the Holy Spirit pronounced what is
   to be for ever. Others render it by 'mn, amen, as though God testified
   that what is said is true and indubitable. But as it never occurs
   except in this song and in the Psalms, and does not always comport with
   what they say, that is, that it denotes certainty or perpetuity, I
   prefer embracing the opinion of those who think that it refers to
   singing, and not to things. And what they add is also probable, if we
   regard its etymology, for the word means to raise or to elevate; and it
   was therefore put down to remind the singers to raise their voice. But
   as it is a thing of no great importance, it is enough shortly to state
   what others think. Let us now go on--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 3:14

   14. Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages:
   they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to
   devour the poor secretly.

   14. Perforasti baculis ejus caput villarum ejus; prosilierunt instar
   turbinis ad dispellendum me; exultatio eorum sicut ad vorandum pauperem
   in abscondito.


   At the beginning of this verse the Prophet pursues the same
   subject--that God had wounded all the enemies of his people; and he
   says that the head of villages or towns had been wounded, though some
   think that phrzym, perezim, mean rather the inhabitants of towns; for
   the Hebrews call fortified towns or villages phrzvt, perezut, and the
   word is commonly found in the feminine gender; but as it is here a
   masculine noun, it is thought that it means the inhabitants. At the
   same time this does not much affect the subject; for the Prophet simply
   means, that not only things had been overthrown by God's hand, but also
   all the provinces under their authority; as though he had said that
   God's vengeance, when his purpose was to defend his people, advanced
   through all the villages and through every region, so that not a corner
   was safe. [62] But we must also notice what follows--with his rods. The
   Prophet means that the wicked had been smitten by their own sword.
   Though the word rods is put here, it is yet to be taken for all kinds
   of instruments or weapons; it is the same as though it was said that
   they had been wounded by their own hands. [63]

   We now perceive the import of this clause--that God not only put forth
   his strength when he purposed to crush the enemies of his people, but
   that he had also smitten them with infatuation and madness, so that
   they destroyed themselves by their own hands. And this was done, as in
   the case of the Midianites, who, either by turning their swords against
   one another, fell by mutual wounds, or by slaying themselves, perished
   by their own hands. (Judges 7:2.) We indeed often read of the wicked
   that they ensnared themselves, fell into the pit which they had made,
   and, in short, perished through their own artifices; and the Prophet
   says here that the enemies of the Church had fallen, through God's
   singular kindness, though no one rose up against them; for they had
   transfixed or wounded themselves by their own staff. Some read--"Thou
   hast cursed his sceptres and the head of his villages;" but the
   interpretation which I have given is much more appropriate.

   He adds, that they came like a whirlwind. It is indeed a verb in the
   future tense; but the sentence must be thus rendered--"When they rushed
   as a whirlwind to cast me down, when their exultation was to devour the
   poor in their hiding-places." It is indeed only a single verb, but it
   comes from sr, sor, which means a whirlwind, and we cannot render it
   otherwise than by a paraphrase. They rushed, he says, like a whirlwind.
   The Prophet here enlarges on the subject of God's power, for he had
   checked the enemies of his people when they rushed on with so much
   impetuosity. Had their advance been slow God might have frustrated
   their attempts without a miracle, but as their own madness rendered
   them precipitate, and made them to be like a whirlwind, God's power was
   more clearly known in restraining such violence. We now understand the
   import of what is here said; for the Prophet's special object is not to
   complain of the violent and impetuous rage of enemies, but to exalt the
   power of God in checking the violent assaults of those enemies whom he
   saw raging against his people.

   He subjoins, their exultation was to devour the poor. He intimates that
   there was nothing in the world capable of resisting the wicked, had not
   God brought miraculous help from heaven; for when they came to devour
   the poor, they came not to wage war, but to devour the prey like wild
   beasts. Then he says, to devour the poor in secret. He means, that the
   people of God had no strength to resist, except help beyond all hope
   came from heaven. [64]

   The import of the whole is--that when the miserable Israelites were
   without any protection, and exposed to the rage and cruelty of their
   enemies, they had been miraculously helped; for the Lord destroyed
   their enemies by their own swords; and that when they came, as it were
   to enjoy a victory, to take the prey, they were laid prostrate by the
   hand of God: hence his power shone forth more brightly. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] The Keri and many MSS. read [phrzyv], "his villages;" but there is
   no need of this change, for the singular is used throughout instead of
   the plural, until we come to the two following lines; and this proves
   that the singular is to be taken in a collective sense. Henderson
   renders it "captains," contrary to the meaning of the word in other
   parts. It means an open unfortified village, as it were scattered, and
   without any boundaries.--Ed.

   [63] Newcome and some others, without any authority, read "thy rod;"
   but conjecture, without some solid reason, cannot be allowed.--Ed.

   [64] "To devour the poor in secret," seems to have an allusion to the
   practice of wild beasts, who take their prey to their dens to devour it
   there. The poor her, as in many other places, mean the helpless, such
   as are destitute of aid or power to resist their enemies. The line may
   be thus rendered-- Their joy was, as it were, to devour the helpless in
   secret. --Ed.

   Habakkuk 3:15

   15. Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap
   of great waters.

   15. Viam fecisti in mari equis tuis per acervum aquarum magnarum.


   Some read, "Thou hast trodden thy horses in the sea;" but it is a
   solecism, that is quite evident. Others, "Thou hast trodden in the sea
   by thy horses." But what need is there of seeking such strained
   explanations, since the verb drk, darek, means to go or to march? The
   Prophet's meaning is by no means doubtful--that God would make a way
   for himself in the sea, and on his own horses. How? even when great
   waters were gathered into a mass. The Prophet again refers to the
   history of the passage through the Red Sea; for it was a work of God,
   as it has been said, worthy of being remembered above all other works:
   it is therefore no wonder that the Prophet dwells so much in setting
   forth this great miracle. Thou then didst make a way for thy horses
   --where? in the sea; which was contrary to nature. And then he adds,
   The heap of waters: for the waters had been gathered together, and a
   firm and thick mass appeared, which was not according to nature; for we
   know that water is a fluid, and that hardly a drop of water can stand
   without flowing. [65] How then was it that he stopped the course of
   Jordan, and that the Red Sea was divided? These were evidences of God's
   incomprehensible power, and rightly ought these to have added courage
   to the faithful, knowing, as they ought to have done, that nothing
   could have opposed their salvation, which God was not able easily to
   remove, whenever it pleased him. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [65] The word is [chmr], which many have rendered acervus--heap; but
   there is no clear instance in which it has such a meaning. It is
   without a preposition, and the Septuagint render it by a participle,
   tarassontas, which agrees with "horses." It is singular in Hebrew, and,
   if a participle, it agrees with the nominative case to the preceding
   verb, [drkt], "thou didst guide" or direct. The two lines might then be
   rendered thus,-- Thou didst guide through the sea thy horses,
   Disturbing mighty waters. Both Marckius and Henderson think that the
   passage through the Red Sea is not what is meant; but the subjugation
   of the Canaanites, conveyed in a language derived from that event.--Ed.

   Habakkuk 3:16

   16. When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice:
   rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I
   might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he
   will invade them with his troops.

   16. Audivit, et contremuit (vel, tumultuatus est) venter meus; ad vocem
   trepidarunt labia mea; ingressa est putredo in ossa mea; et apud me
   tumultuatus sum (ad verbum, tumultuabitur; sed diximus heri de
   temporibus verborum,) ad ascendedum ad populum, excidet eum (vel,
   colliget se.)


   Those interpreters are mistaken in my view, who connect the verb, "I
   have heard," with the last verse, as though the Prophet had said, that
   he had conceived dread from those evidences of God's power: for the
   Prophet had no occasion to fear in regarding God as armed with
   unexpected power for the salvation of his people; there was no reason
   for such a thing. Hence these things do not agree together. But he
   returns again to that dread which he had entertained on account of
   God's voice in those terrific threatenings which we before referred to.
   We must always bear in mind the Prophet's design--that his object was
   to humble the faithful, that they might suppliantly acknowledge to God
   their sins and solicit his forgiveness. His purpose also was to animate
   them with strong hope, that they might nevertheless look for
   deliverance. He had already said at the beginning, "Lord, I have heard
   thy voice; I feared." He now repeats the same thing: for if he had
   spoken only of that terrific voice, the faithful might have been
   overwhelmed with despair; he therefore wished opportunely to prevent
   this evil, by interposing what might have comforted them. For this
   reason he recited these histories, by which God had proved that he was
   armed with invincible power to save his Church. Having done this, he
   applies his general doctrine to present circumstances, and says, "I
   have heard." What had he heard? even those judgements with which God
   had determined to visit the contumacy of his people. Since, then, God
   had threatened his people with a horrible destruction, the Prophet says
   now, that he had heard and trembled, so that he had been confounded. He
   speaks in the singular number; but this was done, as we have said,
   because he represented the whole people, as was the case before (which
   escaped my notice) when he said, his enemies came like whirlwind to
   cast him down; for certainly he did not then speak of himself but of
   the ancient people. As, then, the Prophet here undertakes the cause of
   the whole Church, he speaks as though he were the collective body of
   the people: and so he says that he had heard; but the faithful speak
   here as with one mouth, that they had heard, and that their inside
   trembled

   Some read, "I was dismayed, or I feared, and my inside trembled at his
   voice." He takes qvl, kul, voice, not for report, but, as it has been
   said, for threatening. The faithful, then, declare here, that they
   dreaded the voice of God, before he had executed his judgements, or
   before he inflicted the punishment which he had threatened. He says,
   quiver did my lips. The verb tsll, tsalel, means sometimes to tingle,
   and so some render it here, "Tingle did my lips;" but this is not
   suitable, and more tolerable is the rendering of others, "Palpitate did
   my lips." The Hebrews say that what is meant is that motion in the lips
   which fear or trembling produces. I therefore render the words, "quiver
   did my lips;" as when one says in our language, Mes levres ont barbate;
   that is, when the whole body shakes with trembling, not only a noise is
   made by the clashing of the teeth, but an agitation is also observed in
   the lips.

   Enter, he says, did rottenness into my bones and within myself I made a
   noise, (it is the verb rgz, regaz, again,) or I trembled. No doubt the
   Prophet describes here the dread, which could not have been otherwise
   than produced by the dreadful vengeance of God. It hence follows that
   he does not treat here of those miracles which were, on the contrary,
   calculated to afford an occasion of rejoicing both to the Prophet and
   to the whole of the chosen people; but that the vengeance of God, such
   as had been predicted, is described here.

   He now adds, That I may rest in the day of affliction [66] There seems
   to be here an inconsistency--that the Prophet was affected with grief
   even to rottenness, that he trembled throughout his members with dread,
   and now that all this availed to produce rest. But we must inquire how
   rest is to be obtained through these trepidations, and dreads, and
   tremblings. We indeed know that the more hardened the wicked become
   against God, the more grievous ruin they ever procure for themselves.
   But there is no way of obtaining rest, except for a time we tremble
   within ourselves, that is, except God's judgement awakens us, yea, and
   reduces us almost to nothing. Whosoever therefore securely slumbers,
   will be confounded in the day of affliction; but he who in time
   anticipates the wrath of God, and is touched with fear, as soon as he
   hears that God the judge is at hand, provides for himself the most
   secure rest in the day of affliction. We now then see, that the right
   way of seeking rest is set forth here by the Prophet, when he says,
   that he had been confounded, and that rottenness had entered into his
   bones that he could have no comfort, except he pined away as one
   half-dead: and the design of the Prophet, as I have already said, was
   to exhort the faithful to repentance. But we cannot truly and from the
   heart repent, until our sins become displeasing to us: and the hatred
   of sin proceeds from the fear of God, and that sorrow which Paul
   regards as the mother of repentance. (2 Corinthians 7:10.)

   This exhortation is also very necessary for us in the present day. We
   see how inclined we are by nature to indifference; and when God brings
   before us our sins, and then sets before us his wrath, we are not
   moved; and when we entertain any fear, it soon vanishes. Let us, then,
   know that no rest can be to us in the day of distress, except we
   tremble within ourselves, except dread lays hold on all our faculties,
   and except all our soul becomes almost rotten. And hence it is said in
   Psalm 4:4, "Tremble, and ye shall not sin." And Paul also shows that
   the true and profitable way of being angry is, when one is angry with
   his sins (Ephesians 4:26,) and when we tremble within ourselves. In the
   same manner does the Prophet describe the beginnings of repentance,
   when he says, that the faithful trembled in their bowels, and were so
   shaken within, that even their lips quivered, and, in short, (and this
   is the sum of the whole,) that all their senses felt consternation and
   fear.

   He says, When he shall ascend: he speaks, no doubt, of the Chaldeans;
   When therefore the enemy shall ascend against the people, that he may
   cut them off: for gdh or gvd, gade or gud, means to cut off, and it
   means also to gather, and so some render it, "that he may gather them:"
   but the other meaning is better, "when the enemy shall ascend, that he
   may cut them off." If one would have the word God to be understood, I
   do not object: for the Prophet does not otherwise speak of the
   Chaldeans than as the ministers and executioners of God's wrath.

   In short, he intimates, that they who had been moved and really
   terrified by God's vengeance, would be in a quiet state when God
   executed his judgements. How so? because they would calmly submit to
   the rod, and look for a happy deliverance from their evils; for their
   minds would be seasonably prepared for patience, and then the Lord
   would also console them, as it is said in Psalm 51:17, that he despises
   not contrite hearts. When, therefore, the faithful are in a suitable
   time humbled, and when they thus anticipate the judgement of God, they
   then find a rest prepared for them in his bosom. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [66] The word ['sr], which Calvin renders ut, "that," has occasioned
   great trouble to critics. Marckius reads qui--"who," "Who shall rest,"
   etc.; Henderson, "yet," "Yet I shall have rest," etc. But it is never
   found as an adversative. The construction of this line and the
   following is very difficult; and many have been the forms in which they
   have been rendered. The verb [nvch] means not only to rest from action
   or labor, but also to rest in the sense of remaining or continuing. See
   2 Kings 2:15, and Isaiah 2:2. And were it taken in this latter sense
   here, there would be a consistency in the whole passage. The Prophet
   describes first the dread which seized him on hearing the report of
   God's vengeance; and then in the two last lines he accounts for his
   consternation, because he should remain to witness this vengeance; and
   he proceeds in verse 17 to set forth the effects of it, and in verse 18
   he states that he would still rejoice in the God of his salvation. The
   three verses may be thus rendered,-- 16. I heard, -- and tremble did my
   bowels;
   At the voice my lips quivered;
   Enter does rottenness into my bones,
   And on my own account I tremble;
   Because I shall remain to the day of distress,
   To his coming up to the people, who shall invade me. 17. For the
   fig-tree shall not shoot forth,
   And no produce shall be on the vines;
   Fail shall the fruit of the olive,
   And the fields, none shall yield food;
   Cut off from the fold shall be the sheep,
   And no ox shall be in the stalls: 18. But as for me, in Jehovah will I
   rejoice,
   I will exult in the God of my salvation. "On my own account," or for
   myself, [tchty]: the preposition, [tcht], is often taken in this sense;
   See 2 Samuel 19:21, Proverbs 30:21. "Invade us" or assault us, or them,
   the people, [ygvdnv]; for [nv] is either us or him, but in our language
   them, for so we speak of people. "And the fields, none," etc. There are
   instances of [l'], as here, in which it may be rendered "none" and
   "nothing." See Ezekiel 20:38, Job 6:21, 8:9. "In the God," etc.; it may
   be rendered, "In my God, my Savior," as it is in the Septuagint and the
   Vulgate.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Habakkuk 3:17, 18

   17. Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in
   the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall
   yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there
   shall be no herd in the stalls:

   17. Quia ficus non florebit, et nullus erit fructus in veneis;
   fraudabit opus olivae, et agri non producent cibum (ad verbum, non
   faciet cibum; est mutatio numeri, sed esset asperior illa translatio;
   Agri igitur non producent cibum: porro hac voce comprehendi triticum,
   legumina, et quae ad victum pertinent, satis liquet;) excissum est ab
   ovili pecus, et nullus bos in stabulis:

   18. Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my
   salvation.

   18. Ego autem in Jehova exultabo, laetabor in Deo salutis meae.


   The Prophet declares now at large what that rest would be of which he
   had spoken; it would be even this--that he would not cease to rejoice
   in God, even in the greatest afflictions. He indeed foresees how
   grievous the impending punishment would be, and he warns also and
   arouses the faithful, that they might perceive the approaching
   judgement of God. He says, Flourish shall not the fig, and no fruit
   shall be on the vines; fail shall the olive. First, the fig shall not
   flourish; then, the fields shall produce nothing; and lastly, the
   cattle and the sheep shall fail. Though the figs produce fruit without
   flowering, it is not yet an improper use of phrch, perech, which means
   strictly to bud. [67] He means that the desolation of the land was nigh
   at hand, and that the people would be reduced to extreme poverty. But
   it was an instance of rare virtue, to be able to rejoice in the Lord,
   when occasions of sorrow met him on every side.

   The Prophet then teaches us what advantage it is to the faithful
   seasonably to submit to God, and to entertain serious fear when he
   threatens them, and when he summons them to judgement; and he shows
   that though they might perish a hundred times, they would yet not
   perish, for the Lord would ever supply them with occasions of joy, and
   would also cherish this joy within, so as to enable them to rise above
   all their adversities. Though, then, the land was threatened with
   famine, and though no food would be supplied to them, they would yet be
   able always to rejoice in the God of their salvation; for they would
   know him to be their Father, though for a time he severely chastised
   them. This is a delineation of that rest of which he made mention
   before.

   The import of the whole is--"Though neither the figs, nor the vines,
   nor the olives, produce any fruit, and though the field be barren,
   though no food be given, yet I will rejoice in my God;" that is, our
   joy shall not depend on outward prosperity; for though the Lord may
   afflict us in an extreme degree, there will yet be always some
   consolation to sustain our minds, that they may not succumb under evils
   so grievous; for we are fully persuaded, that our salvation is in God's
   hand, and that he is its faithful guardian. We shall, therefore, rest
   quietly, though heaven and earth were rolled together, and all places
   were full of confusion; yea, though God fulminated from heaven, we
   shall yet be in a tranquil state of mind, looking for his gratuitous
   salvation.

   We now perceive more clearly, that the sorrow produced by the sense of
   our guilt is recommended to us on account of its advantage; for nothing
   is worse than to provoke God's wrath to destroy us; and nothing is
   better than to anticipate it, so that the Lord himself may comfort us.
   We shall not always escape, for he may apparently treat us with
   severity; but though we may not be exempt from punishment, yet while he
   intends to humble us, he will give us reasons to rejoice: and then in
   his own time he will mitigate his severity, and by the effects will
   show himself propitious to us. Nevertheless, during the time when want
   or famine, or any other affliction, is to be borne, he will render us
   joyful with this one consolation, for, relying on his promises, we
   shall look for him as the God of our salvation. Hence, on one side
   Habakkuk sets the desolation of the land; and on the other, the inward
   joy which the faithful never fail to possess, for they are upheld by
   the perpetual favor of God. And thus he warns, as I have said, the
   children of God, that they might be prepared to bear want and famine,
   and calmly to submit to God's chastisements; for had he not exhorted
   them as he did, they might have failed a hundred times.

   We may hence gather a most useful doctrine,--That whenever signs of
   God's wrath meet us in outward things, this remedy remains to us--to
   consider what God is to us inwardly; for the inward joy, which faith
   brings to us, can overcome all fears, terrors, sorrows and anxieties.

   But we must notice what follows, In the God of my salvation: for sorrow
   would soon absorb all our thoughts, except God were present as our
   preserver. But how does he appear as such to the faithful? even when
   they estimate not his love by external things, but strengthen
   themselves by embracing the promise of his mercy, and never doubt but
   that he will be propitious to them; for it is impossible but that he
   will remember mercy even while he is angry. It follows--

   Habakkuk 3:19

   19. The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds'
   feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief
   singer on my stringed instruments.

   19. Jehova Dominus fotitudo mea, et ponet pedes meos quasi cervarum, et
   super excelsa mea ambulare me faciet. Prefecto in Neginothai (vel, in
   pulsationibus meis, vel, musicis instrumentis.)


   He confirms the same truth,--that he sought no strength but in God
   alone. But there is an implied contrast between God and those supports
   on which men usually lean. There is indeed no one, who is not of a
   cheerful mind, when he possesses all necessary things, when no danger,
   no fear is impending: we are then courageous when all things smile on
   us. But the Prophet, by calling God his strength, sets him in
   opposition to all other supports; for he wishes to encourage the
   faithful to persevere in their hope, however grievously God might
   afflict them. His meaning then is,--that even when evils impetuously
   rage against us, when we vacillate and are ready to fall every moment,
   God ought then to be our strength; for the aid which he has promised
   for our support is all-sufficient. We hence see that the Prophet
   entertained firm hope, and by his example animated the faithful,
   provided they had God propitious, however might all other things fail
   them.

   He will make, he says, my feet like those of hinds. I am inclined to
   refer this to their return to their own country, though some give this
   explanation,--"God will give the swiftest feet to his servants, so that
   they may pass over all obstacles to destroy their enemies;" but as they
   might think in their exile that their return was closed up against
   them, the Prophet introduces this most apt similitude, that God would
   give his people feet like those of hinds, so that they could climb the
   precipices of mountains, and dread no difficulties: He will then, he
   says, give me the feet of hinds, and make me to tread on my high
   places. Some think that this was said with regard to Judea, which is,
   as it is well known, mountainous; but I take the expression more simply
   in this way,--that God would make his faithful people to advance boldly
   and without fear along high places: for they who fear hide themselves
   and dare not to raise up the head, nor proceed openly along public
   roads; but the Prophet says, God will make me to tread on any high
   places

   He at last adds, To the leader on my beatings. The first word some are
   wont to render conqueror. This inscription, To the leader, lmntsch,
   lamenatsech, frequently occurs in the Psalms. To the conqueror, is the
   version of some; but it means, I have no doubt, the leader of the
   singers. Interpreters think that God is signified here by this title,
   for he presides over all the songs of the godly: and it may not inaptly
   be applied to him as the leader of the singers, as though the Prophet
   had said,--"God will be a strength to me; though I am weak in myself, I
   shall yet be strong in him; and he will enable me to surmount all
   obstacles, and I shall proceed boldly, who am now like one half-dead;
   and he will thus become the occasion of my song, and be the leader of
   the singers engaged in celebrating his praises, when he shall deliver
   from death his people in so wonderful a manner." We hence see that the
   connection is not unsuitable, when he says, that there would be
   strength for him in God; and particularly as giving of thanks belonged
   to the leader or the chief singer, in order that God's aid might be
   celebrated, not only privately but at the accustomed sacrifices, as was
   usually the case under the law. Those who explain it as denoting the
   beginning of a song, are extremely frigid and jejune in what they
   advance; I shall therefore pass it by.

   He adds, on my beatings. This word, ngynvt, neginoth, I have already
   explained in my work on the Psalms. Some think that it signifies a
   melody, others render it beatings (pulsationes) or notes (modos;) and
   others consider that musical instruments are meant. [68] I affirm
   nothing in a doubtful matter: and it is enough to bear in mind what we
   have said,--that the Prophet promises here to God a continual
   thanksgiving, when the faithful were redeemed, for not only each one
   would acknowledge that they had been saved by God's hand, but all would
   assemble together in the Temple, and there testify their gratitude, and
   not only with their voices confess God as their Deliverer, but also
   with instruments of music, as we know it to have been the usual custom
   under the Law.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [68] No satisfactory conjectures have been made by any as to the my
   added to this word. Hezekiah says at the end of his prayer, Isaiah
   38:20, [nngz vngynvty], "and my neginoth will we sing," or play, etc.
   Our version makes this my to refer to the ode or song he made to be
   played on the neginoth, supposed to have been a stringed instrument. In
   this case, "my neginoth" means the song he made for the neginoth. Then
   we might render the words,-- For the leader; my song on the stringed
   instruments. --Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease not daily to provoke thy wrath
   against us, and as the hardness and obstinacy of our flesh is so great,
   that it is necessary for us to be in various ways afflicted,--O grant,
   that we may patiently bear thy chastisements, and under a deep feeling
   of sorrow flee to thy mercy; and may we in the meantime persevere in
   the hope of that mercy, which thou hast promised, and which has been
   once exhibited towards us in Christ, so that we may not depend on the
   earthly blessings of this perishable life, but relying on thy word may
   proceed in the course of our calling, until we shall at length be
   gathered into that blessed rest, which is laid up for us in heaven,
   through Christ one Lord. Amen.

   Calvin's Preface to zephaniah.

   Zephaniah is placed the last of the Minor Prophets who performed their
   office before the Babylonian Captivity; and the inscription shows that
   he exercised his office of teaching at the same time with Jeremiah,
   about thirty years before the city was destroyed, the Temple pulled
   down, and the people led into exile. Jeremiah, it is true, followed his
   vocation even after the death of Josiah, while Zephaniah prophesied
   only during his reign.

   The substance of his Book is this: He first denounces utter destruction
   on a people who were so perverse, that there was no hope of their
   repentance;--he then moderates his threatening, by denouncing God's
   judgments on their enemies, the Assyrians, as well as others, who had
   treated with cruelty the Church of God; for it was no small
   consolation, when the Jews heard that they were so regarded by God,
   that he would undertake their cause and avenge their wrongs. He
   afterwards repeats again his reproofs, and shortly mentions the sins
   which then prevailed among the elect people of God; and, at the same
   time, he turns his discourse to the faithful, and exhorts them to
   patience, setting before them the hope of favor, provided they ever
   looked to the Lord; and provided they relied on the gratuitous covenant
   which he made with Abraham, and doubted not but that he would be a
   Father to them, and also looked, with a tranquil mind, for that
   redemption which had been promised to them. This is the sum of the
   whole Book.

   Zephaniah 1:1

   1. The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the
   son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of
   Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

   1. Sermo Jehovae, qui fuit ad Zephaniam, filium Chusi, filii Gedoliae,
   filii Amariae, filii Chizkiae, in diebus Josiae, filii Amon, regis
   Jehudah.


   Zephaniah first mentions the time in which he prophesied; it was under
   the king Josiah. The reason why he puts down the name of his father
   Amon does not appear to me. The Prophet would not, as a mark of honor,
   have made public a descent that was disgraceful and infamous. Amon was
   the son of Manasseh, an impious and wicked king; and he was nothing
   better than his father. We hence see that his name is recorded, not for
   the sake of honor, but rather of reproach; and it may have been that
   the Prophet meant to intimate, what was then well known to all, that
   the people had become so obdurate in their superstitions, that it was
   no easy matter to restore them to a sound mind. But we cannot bring
   forward anything but conjecture; I therefore leave the matter without
   pretending to decide it.

   With regard to the pedigree of the Prophet, I have mentioned elsewhere
   what the Jews affirm--that when the Prophets put down the names of
   their fathers, they themselves had descended from Prophets. But
   Zephaniah mentions not only his father and grandfather, but also his
   great-grandfather and his great-great-grandfather; and it is hardly
   credible that they were all Prophets, and there is not a word
   respecting them in Scripture. I do not think, as I have said elsewhere,
   that such a rule is well-founded; but the Jews in this case, according
   to their manner, deal in trifles; for in things unknown they hesitate
   not to assert what comes to their minds, though it may not have the
   least appearance of truth. It is possible that the father, grandfather,
   the great-grandfather, and the great-great-grandfather of the Prophet,
   were persons who excelled in piety; but this also is uncertain. What is
   especially worthy of being noticed is-- that he begins by saying that
   he brought nothing of his own, but faithfully, and, as it were, by the
   hand, delivered what he had received from God.

   With regard, then, to his pedigree, it is a matter of no great moment;
   but it is of great importance to know that God was the author of his
   doctrine, and that Zephaniah was his faithful minister, who introduced
   not his own devices, but was only the announcer of celestial truth. Let
   us now proceed to the contents -

   Zephaniah 1:2, 3

   2. I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the Lord

   2. Perdendo perdam (vel, colligendo colligam) omnia ex superficie
   terrae, dicit Jehova.

   3. I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the
   heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the
   wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the Lord.

   3. Perdam (vel, colligam) hominem et bestiam; perdam autem avem
   coelorum, et pisces maris; et offendicula erunt impiis; et excidam
   hominem e superficie terrae, dicit Jehova.


   It might seem at the first view that the Prophet dealt too severely in
   thus fulminating against his own nation; for he ought to have begun
   with doctrine, as this appears to be the just order of things. But the
   Prophet denounces ruin, and shows at the same time why God was so
   grievously displeased with the people. We must however remember, that
   the Prophet, living at the same period with Jeremiah, had regard to the
   stubbornness of the people, who had been already with more than
   sufficient evidence proved to have been guilty. Hence he darts forth as
   of a sudden and denounces the wickedness of the people, which had been
   already exposed; so there was to be no more contention on the subject,
   for their iniquity had become quite ripe. And no doubt it was ever the
   object of the Prophets to unite their endeavors so as to assist one
   another: and this united effort ought ever to be among all the servants
   of God, that no one may do anything apart, but with joined efforts they
   may promote the same object, and at the same time strive mutually to
   confirm the common truth. This is what our Prophet is now doing.

   He knew that God would have used various means to restore them, had not
   the corruption of the people become now past recovery. Having observed
   that all others had spent their labor in vain, he directly attacks the
   wicked men who had, as it were designedly, cast aside every fear of
   God, and shook off every shame. Since, then, it was openly evident that
   with determined rebellion they resisted God, it was no wonder that the
   Prophet began with so much severity.

   But here a difficulty meets us. He said in the first verse, that he
   thus spoke under Josiah; but we know that the land was then cleansed
   from its superstitions. For we learn, that when that pious king
   attained manhood, he labored most strenuously to restore the pure
   worship of God; and when all places were full of wicked superstitions,
   he not only constrained the tribe of Judah to adopt the true worship of
   God, but he also stimulated his neighbors who had remained and were
   dispersed through the land of Israel. Since, then, the pious king had
   strenuously and courageously promoted the interest of true religion, it
   seems a wonder that God was still so much displeased. But we must
   remember, that though Josiah sincerely worshipped God, yet the people
   were not really changed; for it has often happened, that God roused the
   chief men and leaders, while few, or hardly any, followed them, but
   only yielded a feigned obedience. This was no doubt the case in the
   time of Josiah; the hearts of the people were alienated from God and
   true religion, so that they chose rather to rot in their filth than to
   return to the true worship of God. And that this was the case soon
   appeared by the event; for Josiah did not reign long after he had
   cleansed the land from its defilements, and Jehoahaz succeeded him; and
   then the people immediately relapsed into their idolatry; and though
   for three months only his successor reigned, yet true religion was in
   that short time abolished. It is hence an obvious conclusion, that the
   people had ever been wedded to impiety, and that its roots were hidden
   in their hearts; though they apparently pretended to worship God, and,
   in order to please the king, embraced the worship divinely prescribed
   in their law; yet the event proved that it was a mere act of
   dissimulation, yea, of perfidy. Then after Jehoahaz followed Jehoiakim,
   and no better was their condition down to the time of Zedekiah; in
   short, no remedy could be found for their unhealable wound.

   It hence plainly appears, that though Josiah made use of all means to
   revive the true and unadulterated worship of God in Judea, he did not
   yet gain his object. And we hence clearly learn how hard were the
   trials he sustained, seeing that he effected nothing, though at great
   hazard he attempted to restore the worship of God. When he found that
   he labored in vain, he no doubt had to contend with great difficulties;
   and this we know by our own experience. When hope of success shines on
   us, we easily overcome all troubles, however arduous our work may be;
   but when we see that we strive in vain, we become dejected: and when we
   see that our labor succeeds only for a few years, our spirit grows
   faint. Josiah surmounted these two difficulties; for the perverseness
   of the people was sufficiently evident, and he was also reminded by two
   Prophets, Jeremiah and Zephaniah, that the people would still cherish
   their impious perverseness. When, therefore, he plainly saw that his
   labor was almost in vain, he might have fainted in the middle of his
   course, or, as they say, at the starting-place. And since the benefit
   was so small during his reign, what could he have hoped after his
   death?

   This example ought at this day to be carefully observed: for though God
   now appears to the world in full light, yet very few there are who
   submit themselves to his word; and of this small number fewer still
   there are who sincerely and without any dissimulation embrace sound
   doctrine. We indeed see how great is their inconstancy and
   indifference. For they who pretend great zeal for a time very soon
   vanish and fall away. Since then the perversity of the world is so
   great, sufficient to deject the minds of God's servants a hundred
   times, let us learn to look to Josiah, who in his own time left undone
   nothing, which might serve to establish the true worship of God; and
   when he saw that he effected but little and next to nothing, he still
   persevered, and with firm and invincible greatness of mind proceeded in
   his course.

   We may also derive hence an admonition no less useful not to regard
   ours as the golden age, because some portion of men profess the pure
   worship of God: for many, by no means wicked men, think, that almost
   all mortals are like angels, as soon as they testify in words their
   approbation of the gospel: and the sacred name of Reformation is at
   this day profaned, when any one who shows as it were by a nod only that
   he is not wholly an enemy to the gospel, is immediately lauded as a
   person of extraordinary piety. Though then many show some regard for
   religion, let us yet know that among so large a number there are many
   hypocrites, and that there is much chaff mixed with the wheat: and that
   our senses may not deceive us, we may see here, as in a mirror, how
   difficult it is to restore the world to the obedience of God, and
   utterly to root up all corruptions, though idols may be taken away and
   superstitions be abolished. No doubt Josiah had regard to everything
   calculated to cleanse the Church, and had recourse to the advice of
   Jeremiah and also of Zephaniah; we yet see that he did not attain the
   object he wished, for God now became more grievously displeased with
   his people than under Manasseh, or under Amon. These wicked kings had
   attempted to extinguish all true religion; they had cruelly raged
   against all God's servants, so that Jerusalem became almost drenched
   with innocent blood: and yet God seems here to have manifested greater
   displeasure under Josiah than during the previous cruelty and so many
   impieties. But as I have already said, there is no reason why we should
   despond, though the world by its ingratitude may close up the way
   against us; and however much may Satan also by this artifice strive to
   discourage us, let us still perseveringly go on according to the duties
   of our calling.

   But it may be now asked, why God denounces his vengeance on the beasts
   of the field, the birds of heaven, and the fishes of the sea; for how
   much soever the Jews may have provoked him by their sins, innocent
   animals ought to have been spared. If a son is not to be punished for
   the fault of his father, Ezekiel 18:4, but that the soul that has
   sinned is to die, why did God turn his wrath against fishes and other
   animals? This seems to have been a hasty and unreasonable infliction.
   But let this rule be first borne in mind--that it is preposterous in us
   to estimate God's doings according to our judgment, as froward and
   proud men do in our day; for they are disposed to judge of God's works
   with such presumption, that whatever they do not approve, they think it
   right wholly to condemn. But it behaves us to judge modestly and
   soberly, and to confess that God's judgments are a deep abyss: and when
   a reason for them does not appear, we ought reverently and with due
   humility to hook for the day of their full revelation. This is one
   thing. Then it is meet at the same time to remember, that as animals
   were created for man's use, they must undergo a lot in common with him:
   for God made subservient to man both the birds of heaven, and the
   fishes of the sea, and all other animals. It is then no matter of
   wonder, that the condemnation of him, who enjoys a sovereignty over the
   whole earth, should reach to animals. And we know that the world was
   not made subject to corruption willingly--that is, naturally; but
   because the contagion from Adam's fall diffused itself through heaven
   and earth. Hence the sun and the moon, and all the stars, and also all
   the animals, the earth itself, and the whole world, bear marks of God's
   wrath, not because they have provoked it through their own fault, but
   because the whole world is involved in man's curse. The reason then is,
   because all things were created for the sake of man. Hence there is no
   ground to conclude, that God acts with too much severity when he
   executes his vengeance on innocent animals, for he can justly involve
   in the same ruin with man whatever he has created for his use.

   But the reason also is sufficiently plain, why the Prophet speaks here
   of the beasts of the earth, the fishes of the sea, and the birds of
   heaven: for we find that men grow torpid, or rather stupid in their own
   indifference, except they are forcibly roused. It was, therefore,
   necessary for the Prophet, when he saw the people so hardened in their
   wickedness, and that he had to do with men past recovery, to set
   clearly before them these judgments of God, as though he had said--"Ye
   lie down securely, and indulge yourselves, when God is coming forth
   prepared for vengeance: but his wrath shall not only proceed against
   you, but will also lay hold on the harmless animals; for ye shall see a
   horrible judgment executed on your oxen and asses, on the birds and the
   fishes. What will become of you when God's wrath shall be thus kindled
   against the unhappy creatures who have committed no sins? Shall ye
   indeed escape unpunished?" We now understand why the Prophet does not
   speak here of men only, but collects with them the beasts of the earth,
   the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air.

   He says first, By removing I will remove all things from the face of
   the land; he afterwards enumerates particulars: but immediately after
   he clearly shows, that God would not act rashly and inconsiderately
   while executing his vengeance, for his sole purpose was to punish the
   wicked, There shall be, he says, stumblingblocks to the ungodly; [69]
   it is the same as though he said--"When I cite to God's tribunal both
   the fishes of the sea and the birds of heaven, think not that God's
   controversy is with these creatures which are void of reason, but they
   are to sustain a part of God's vengeance, which ye have through your
   sins deserved." The Prophet then does here briefly show, that what he
   had before threatened brute creatures with, would come upon them on
   men's account; for God's design was to execute vengeance on the wicked;
   and as he saw that they were extremely torpid, he tried to awaken them
   by manifest tokens, so that they might see God the avenger as it were
   in a striking picture. And at the same time he also adds, I will remove
   man from the face of the land. He does not speak now of fishes or of
   other animals, but refers to men only. Hence appears more clearly what
   I have said--that the Prophet was under the necessity of speaking as he
   did, owing to the insensibility of the people. He now adds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [69] This clause stands connected with the preceding words; "the
   stumblingblocks" were the idols, and they were to be taken away "along
   with the wicked," according to Henderson, and according to the version
   of Symmachus, sun asebesi, though Newcome, with less accuracy, renders
   the words thus,-- And the stumblingblocks of the wicked. The whole
   verse is poetical in its language; the collective singular, and not the
   plural, is used; and the first verb, ['mph], in its most common
   meaning, is very expressive, and denotes the manner of the ruin that
   awaited the Jews. They were "gathered" and led into captivity. The two
   verses may be thus literally rendered,-- 2. Gatherings I will gather
   everything
   From off the face of the land, saith Jehovah; 3. I will gather man and
   best;
   I will gather the bird of heaven and the fish of the sea,
   And the stumblingblocks together with the wicked;
   And I will cut them off, together with man,
   From the face of the land, saith Jehovah. --Ed.

   Zephaniah 1:4

   4. I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from
   this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;

   4. Et extendam manum meam super Jehudah, et super omnes incolas
   Jerusalem; et excidam ex loco hoc reliquias Baal, et nomen cultorum cum
   sacerdotibus.


   The Prophet explains still more clearly why he directed his discourse
   in the last verse against the beasts of the earth and the birds of
   heaven, even for this end--that the Jews might understand that God was
   angry with them. I will stretch forth, he says, my hand on Judah and on
   Jerusalem. God, then, by executing his vengeance on animals, intended
   to exhibit to the Jews, as in a picture, the dreadfulness of his wrath,
   which yet they despised and regarded as nothing. The stretching forth
   of God's hand I have elsewhere explained; and it means even this--that
   he stretches forth his hand when he acts in an unusual manner, and
   employs means beyond what is common. We indeed know that God has no
   hands, and we also know that he performs all things by his command
   alone: but as everything seen in the world is called the work of his
   hands, so he is said to stretch forth his hand when he mentions a work
   that is remarkable and worthy of being remembered. In a like manner,
   when I intend to do some slight work, I only move my hand; but when I
   have some difficult work to do, I prepare myself more carefully, and
   also stretch forth my arms. This metaphor, then, is intended only for
   this purpose, to render men more attentive to God's works, when he is
   set forth as stretching forth his hand.

   But he says, on Judah and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The kingdom
   of Israel had now been abolished, and the ten tribes had been led into
   exile; and a few only of the lowest and the poorest remained. The Jews
   thought themselves safe for ever, because they had escaped that
   calamity. This is the reason why the Prophet declares that God's
   judgment was impending not only over the kingdom of Judah, but also
   over the holy city, which thought itself exempt from all such evil,
   because there were the sacrifices performed, and there was the royal
   city, and, in short, because God had testified that his habitation was
   to be there for ever. Since, then, by this vain confidence the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem deceived themselves and others, Zephaniah
   specifically addresses them. And as he had before spoken of the wicked,
   he intended here, no doubt, sharply to reprove the Jews, as though he
   said by way of anticipation, There is no reason for you to enquire who
   are the wicked; for ye yourselves are they, even ye who are the holy
   people of God and God's chosen inheritance, ye who are the race of
   Abraham, who flatter yourselves so much on account of your excellency;
   ye are the wicked, who have not hitherto ceased to provoke the
   vengeance of God. And at the same time he shows, as it were by the
   finger, some of their sins, though he mentions others afterwards: but
   he speaks now of their superstitions.

   I will cut off, he says, the remnants of Baal and the name of Chamerim.
   The severity of the Prophet may seem here again to be excessive, for
   being so incensed against superstitions which had been abolished by the
   great zeal and singular diligence of the king; but, as we have already
   intimated, he regarded not so much the king as the people. For though
   they dared not openly to adulterate God's worship, they yet cherished
   those corruptions at home to which they had before been accustomed, as
   we see to be done at this day. For when it is not allowed to worship
   idols, many mutter their prayers in secret and invoke their idols: and,
   in short, they are restrained only by the fear of men from manifesting
   their own impiety; and in the meantime, they retain before God the same
   abominations. So it was in the time of Josiah; the people were wedded
   to their corruptions, and this we may easily conclude from the words of
   Zephaniah: for the remnants of Baal were not seen in the temple, nor in
   the streets, nor in their chapels, nor in the high places; but their
   hidden impiety is here discovered by the Spirit of God; and no doubt
   their sin was the more heinous and less excusable, because the people
   refused to follow their pious leader. It was indeed the most abominable
   ingratitude; for when they saw that the right worship was restored to
   them, they preferred to remain fixed in their own filth, rather than to
   return to God, even when they had liberty to do so, and also when that
   pious king extended his hand to them.

   As to the word kmrym, chemarim, it designated either the worshipers of
   Baal or some such men as our monks at this day: and they are supposed
   by some to have been thus called, because they were clothed in black
   vestments; while others think that they derived this name from their
   fervor, because they were madly devoted to their superstitions, or
   because they had marks on their foreheads, or because they imposed, as
   is commonly the case, on the simple by the ardor of their zeal. The
   name is also found in 2 Kings 23:1 in the account given of Josiah: for
   it is said there, that the kmrym, chemarim, were taken away, together
   with other abominations of superstition. But as Zephaniah connects
   priests with them, it is probable that they were a kind of people like
   the monks, who did not themselves offer sacrifices, but were a sort of
   attendants, who undertook vows and offered prayers in the name of the
   whole people. For what some think, that they were thus called because
   they burnt incense, appears not to me probable; for then they must have
   been priests. They were then inferior to the sacrificers, and occupying
   a station between them and the people, like the monks and hermits of
   this day, who deceive foolish men by their sanctity. Such, then, were
   the Chemarim. [70]

   But as Josiah could not attain his object, so as immediately to cleanse
   the land from these pollutions, we need not wonder that at this day we
   are not able immediately to remove superstitions from the world: but
   let us in the meantime ever proceed in our course. Let those endued
   with authority, who bear the sword, that is, all magistrates, perform
   their office with greater diligence, inasmuch as they see how difficult
   and protracted is the contest with the ministers of idolatry. Let also
   the ministers of the gospel earnestly cry against idolatry, and all
   ungodly ceremonies, and not desist. Though they may not effect as much
   as they wish, yet let them follow the example of Josiah. If God should
   in the meantime thunder from heaven, let them not be discouraged, but,
   on the contrary, know that their labor is approved by him, and never
   doubt of their own safety; for though all were destroyed, their godly
   efforts would not be in vain, nor fail of a reward before God. Thus,
   then, ought all God's servants to animate themselves, each in his
   particular sphere and vocation, whenever they have to contend with
   superstitions, and with such corruptions as vitiate and adulterate the
   pure worship of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [70] The word is found in two other places, 2 Kings 23:5, and Hosea
   10:5. In the latter text the priests of the calf of Bethaven are thus
   called; in the former, they are said to be those who "burnt incense in
   the high places." From this fact, Parkhurst concludes, that they were
   called scorched, as the word means, by their fumigating fires. The
   "priests" mentioned here were the sacrifices, while the "Chemarim" were
   the incense-burners. There were "altars" (not an altar) reared for Baal
   in the temple; one, as it seems, for sacrifices, and the other for
   incense. See 2 Kings 21:3. In 2 Chronicles 34:4, 5, the priests and
   sacrificers are alone mentioned; but in 2 Kings 23:5, where the same
   things are recorded, the Chemarim and incense are alone named. The
   Prophet in this passage mentions both. Some, as Cocceius and Henderson,
   have been disposed to think that the unfaithful priests of the true God
   are here meant. But the other view is more consistent with the whole
   passage. If we retain not the original word, we may thus render the
   line,-- The name of the incense-burners with the priests; That is,
   those who burnt incense and those who offered sacrifices to Baal.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are so prone to corruptions, and so
   easily turn from the right course after having commenced it, and so
   easily degenerate from the truth once known,--O grant, that, being
   strengthened by thy Spirit, we may persevere to the end in the right
   way which thou showest to us in thy word, and that we may also labor to
   restore the many who abandon themselves to various errors; and though
   we may effect nothing, let us not yet be led away after them, but
   remain firm in the obedience of faith, until having at length finished
   all these contests, we shall be gathered into that blessed rest which
   is prepared for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Zephaniah 1:5

   5. And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and
   them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by
   Malcham;

   5. Et super eos qui adorant super tecta militiam coelorum, et eos qui
   adorant et jurant per Jehovam, et jurant per regem suum.


   Zephaniah pursues the subject contained in the verse I explained
   yesterday. For as the majority of the people still adhered to their
   superstitions, though the pure worship of the law had been restored by
   Josiah, the Prophet threatens here, that God would punish such
   ingratitude. As then he had spoken in the last verse of the worshipers
   of Baal and their sacrifices, so now he proceeds farther--that the Lord
   would execute vengeance on the whole people, who prayed to the host of
   heaven, or bowed themselves down before the host of heaven. It is well
   known that those stars are thus called in Scripture to which the
   gentiles ascribed, on account of their superior lustre, some sort of
   divinity. Hence it was, that they worshipped the sun as God, called the
   moon the queen of heaven, and also paid adoration to the stars. The
   people, then, did not only sin in worshipping Baal, but were also
   addicted to many superstitions, as we see to be the case whenever men
   degenerate from the genuine doctrine of true religion; they then seek
   out various inventions on all sides, so that they observe no limits and
   keep within no boundaries.

   But he says, that they worshipped the stars on their roofs. It is
   probable that they chose this higher place, as interpreters remind us,
   because they thought that they were more seen by the stars the nearer
   they were to them. For as men are gross in their ideas they never think
   God propitious to them except he exhibits some proof or sign of a
   bodily presence; in short, they always seek God according to their own
   earthly notions. Since, then, the Jews thought that there were so many
   Gods as there are stars in heaven, it is no wonder that they ascended
   to the roofs of their houses, that they might be, as it were, in the
   sight of their gods, and thus not lose their labor; for the
   superstitious never think that their devotion is observed by God,
   unless they have before their eyes, as we have just said, some sign of
   his presence.

   We now then see how this verse stands connected with the last. God
   declares that he would punish all idolaters; but as the Jews worshipped
   Baal, the Prophet first condemned that strange religion; and now he
   adds other devices, to which the Jews perversely devoted themselves;
   for they worshipped also all the stars, ascribing to them some sort of
   divinity. Then he mentions all those who worshipped and swore by their
   own king, and swore by Jehovah

   By these last words the Prophet intimates, that the Jews had not so
   repudiated the law of God but that they boasted that they still
   worshipped the God who had adopted them, and by whom they had been
   redeemed, who had commanded the temple to be built for him, and an
   altar on mount Sion. They then did not openly reject the worship of the
   true God, but formed such a mixture for themselves, that they joined to
   the true God their own idols, as we see to be the state of things at
   this day under the Papacy. It seems a sufficient excuse to foolish men
   that they retain the name of God; and they confidently boast that the
   true God is worshipped by them; and yet we see that they mix together
   with this worship many of the delusions of Satan; for under the Papacy
   there is no end to their inventions. When any devise some peculiar mode
   of worship, it is then connected with the rest; and thus they form such
   a mixture, that from one God, divided into many parts, they bring forth
   a vast troop of deities. As then at this day the Papists worship God
   and idols too, so Zephaniah had to condemn the same wickedness among
   the Jews.

   We here learn that God's name was not then wholly obliterated, as
   though the world had openly fallen away from God; for though they
   worshipped Jupiter, Mercury, Apollo, and other fictitious gods, they
   yet professed to worship the only true and eternal God, the Creator of
   heaven and earth. What then was it that the Prophet condemned that they
   were not content with what the law simply and plainly prescribed, but
   that they devised for themselves various and strange modes of worship;
   for when men take to themselves such a liberty as this, they no longer
   worship the true God, how much soever they may pretend to do so,
   inasmuch as God repudiates all spurious modes of worship, as he
   testifies especially in Ezekiel 20--Go ye, he says, worship your idols.
   He shows that all kinds of worship are abominable to him whenever men
   depart in any measure from his pure word. For we must hold this as the
   main principle--that obedience is more valued by God than all
   sacrifices. Whenever men run after their own inventions they depart
   from the true God; for they refuse to render to him what he principally
   requires, even obedience.

   But our Prophet speaks according to the common notions of men; for they
   pretended to be the true worshipers of God, while they still adhered to
   their own inventions. They did not, indeed, properly speaking, worship
   the true God; but as they thought, and openly professed to do this,
   Zephaniah, making this concession, says--God will not suffer his own
   worship to be thus profaned: ye seek to blend it with that of your
   idols; this he will not endure. Ye worship the true God, and ye worship
   your idols; but he would have himself to be worshipped alone; and this
   he deserves. But the partition which ye make is nothing else than the
   mangling of true worship; and God will not have himself to be thus in
   part worshipped. We now understand what the Prophet means here; for the
   Jews covered their abominations with the pretext that their purpose was
   to worship the God of Abraham: the Prophet does not simply deny this to
   be done by them, but declares that this worship was useless and
   disapproved by God; nay, he proceeds farther, and says that this
   worship, made up of various inventions, was an abominable corruption
   which God would punish; for he can by no means bear that there should
   be such an alliance--that idols should be substituted in his place, and
   that a part of his glory should be transferred to the inventions of
   men. This is the true meaning.

   We hence learn how greatly deceived the Papists are, who think it
   enough, provided they depart not wholly from the worship of the only
   true God; for God allows and approves of no worship except when we
   attend to his voice, and turn not aside either to the left hand or to
   the right, but acquiesce only in what he has prescribed.

   It is nothing strange that he connects swearing with worship, for it is
   a kind of divine worship. Hence the Scripture, stating a part for the
   whole, often mentions swearing in this sense, as including the service
   due to God. But the Prophet pronounces here generally a curse on all
   the superstitious, who worshipped fictitious gods; and then he adds one
   kind of worship, and that is swearing. I shall not here speak at large,
   nor is it-- necessary, on the subject of swearing. We know that the use
   of an oath is lawful when God is appealed to as a witness and a judge,
   on important occasions; for God's name may be interposed when a matter
   requires proof, and when it is important; but God's name is not to be
   introduced thoughtlessly. Hence two things are especially required in
   an oath--that all who swear by his name should present themselves with
   reverence before his tribunal, and acknowledge him to be the avenger if
   they take his name falsely or inconsiderately This is one thing. Then
   the matter itself, on account of which we swear, must be considered;
   for if men allow themselves to swear by God's name respecting things
   which are trifling and frivolous, it is a shameful profanation, and by
   no means to be borne. For it is a singular favor on the part of God,
   that he allows us to take his name when there is any controversy among
   us, and when a confirmation is necessary. As then we thus receive
   through kindness the name of God, it is surely a great favor; for how
   great is the sanctity of that name, though it serves even earthly
   concerns? God then does so far accommodate himself to us, that it is
   lawful for us to swear by his name. Hence a greater seriousness ought
   to be observed by us in oaths, so that no one should dare to interpose
   an oath except when necessity requires; and we should also especially
   take heed lest God be called a witness to what is false. For how great
   a sacrilege it is to cover a falsehood with his name, who is the
   eternal and immutable truth! They then who swear falsely by his name
   change God, as far as they can, into what he is not. We now
   sufficiently understand how swearing is a kind of divine worship,
   because his honor is thereby given to God; for his majesty is, as it
   were, brought before us, and as it is his peculiar office to know and
   to discover hidden things, and also to maintain the truth, this his own
   work is ascribed to him. Now when any one swears by a mortal, or by the
   sun, or by the moon, or by creatures, he deprives God in part of his
   own honor.

   We hence see that in superstitious oaths there was a clear proof of
   idolatry. This is the reason why the Prophet here condemns those who
   did swear by Jehovah and by Malkom; that is, who joined their idols
   with the true and eternal God when they swore. For it is a clear
   precept of God's law, By the name of thy God shalt thou swear.'
   Deuteronomy 6:13. And when the Prophets speak of the renovation of the
   Church, they use this form--Ye shall swear by the name of God;' To me
   shall bend every knee;' Every tongue shall swear to me.' What does all
   this mean? The whole world shall acknowledge me as the true God; and as
   every knee shall bow to me, so every one will submit himself to my
   judgment. We may hence doubtlessly conclude, that God is deprived of
   his right, whenever we swear by the sun, or by the moon, or by the
   dead, or by any creatures.

   This evil has been common in all ages; and it prevails still at this
   day under the Papacy. They swear by the Virgin, by angels, and by the
   dead. They do not think that they thus take away anything from the
   sovereignty of the only true God; but we see what he declares
   respecting them. The Papists therefore foolishly excuse themselves,
   when they swear by their saints: for they cannot elude the charge of
   sacrilege, which the Holy Spirit has stamped with perpetual infamy,
   since he has said, that all those are abominable in the sight of God
   who swear by any other name than his own: and the reason is evident,
   for the sun, moon, and stars, and also dead or living men, are honored
   with the name of God, when they are set up as judges. For they who
   swear by the sun, do the same as though they said--The sun is my
   witness and judge; that is, The sun is my God. They who swear by the
   name of a king, or as profane men swore formerly, By the genius of
   their king, ascribe to a mortal what is peculiar to the true God alone.
   But when any one swears by heaven or the temple, and does not think
   that there is any divinity in the heavens or in the temple, it is the
   same as though he swore by God himself, as it appears from Matthew
   23:20-22; and Christ, when he forbade us to swear by heaven or by the
   earth, did not condemn such modes of swearing as inconsistent with his
   word, but as only useless and vain. At the same time he showed that
   God's name is profaned by such expressions: They who swear by heaven,
   swear also by him who inhabits heaven; they who swear by the temple,
   swear also by him who is worshipped in the temple, and to whom
   sacrifices are offered.' When one swears by his head or by his life, it
   is a protestation, as though he said--As my life is dear to me. But
   they who swear by the saints, either living or dead, ascribe to mortals
   what is due to God. They who swear by the sun, place a dead created
   thing on the throne of God himself.

   As to the term mlkm, melkom, it may be properly rendered, their king;
   for mlk, melak, as it is well known, means a king; but it is here put
   in construction, mlkm, melkom, their king; they swear by their own,
   king [71] The Prophet, I doubt not, alludes to the word mvlk, Molok,
   which is derived from the verb, to reign: for though that word was
   commonly used by all as a proper name, it is yet certain that that
   false god was so called, as though he was a king: and the Prophet
   increases the indignity by saying--They swear by Malkom. He might have
   simply said, They swear by Moloch; but he says, They swear by Malkom;
   that is, They forget that I am their king, and transfer my sovereignty
   to a dead and empty image. God then does here, by an implied contrast,
   exaggerate the sin of the Jews, as they sought another king for
   themselves, when they knew that under his protection they always
   enjoyed a sure and real safety. Let us now proceed--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [71] It appears that this idol had two names, Moloc and Milcom, or
   Molcam. It is called Moloc, or Molec, in Leviticus 20:5, and in seven
   other places; but Milcom in 1 Kings 11:5,33; 2 Kings 23:14; as well as
   here, and also in Jeremiah 49:1,3, though improperly rendered in our
   version, "their king." The Ammonites are the people spoken of. The
   swearing is here differently expressed: it is to [(l)] Jehovah; and by
   [(v)] Milcam. To swear to, is to make a promise to another by an oath,
   or, in this instance, to swear allegiance to God: but to swear by, is
   to appeal to another as witness to an engagement. We have the two forms
   together in Joshua 9:19. The Jews made a solemn profession of obedience
   to God, and yet they acknowledged Melcam as God, by appealing to him as
   a witness to the truth. It is called the abomination of the Ammonites,
   1 Kings 11:33 The image of this god, according to the Rabbins, was
   hollow, made of brass, and had seven compartments. In the first, they
   put flour--in the second, turtles--in the third, an ewe--in the fourth,
   a ram--in the fifth, a calf--in the sixth, an ox--and in the seventh, a
   child! All these were burnt together by heating the image in the
   inside! To drown the cries and noises that might be made, they used
   drums and other instruments. See [mlk] in Parkhurst. How cruel is
   superstition! and yet how wedded to it is man by nature! Though the
   Jews had knowledge of the religion of him who is the God of love and
   mercy; yet they preferred the religion of savages and barbarians. How
   strongly does this fact prove man's natural antipathy to God!--Ed.

   Zephaniah 1:6

   6. And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not
   sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.

   6. Et qui retro aguntur, ne sequantur Jehovam, (ad verbum est, de-post
   Jehovam.) et qui non quaerunt Jehovam, neque investigant eum.


   The Prophet seems here to include, as it were, in one bundle, the proud
   despisers of God, as well as those idolaters of whom he had spoken. It
   may yet be, that he describes the same persons in different words, and
   that he means that they were addicted to their own superstitions,
   because they were unwilling to serve God sincerely and from the heart,
   and even shunned everything that might lead their attention to true
   religion. And this view I mostly approve; for what some imagine, that
   their gross contempt of God is here pointed out, is not sufficiently
   supported. I therefore rather think that the idolaters are here
   reproved, that they might not suppose that they could by subterfuges
   wash away their guilt; for they were wont to cover themselves with the
   shield of ignorance, when they were overcome, and their impiety was
   fully proved: I did not think so; but, on the contrary, my purpose was
   to worship God. Since, then, the superstitious are wont to hide
   themselves under the covering of ignorance, the Prophet here defines
   the idolatry of the people, and briefly shows that it was connected
   with obstinacy and wickedness.

   They did not seek Jehovah; but, on the contrary, they turned willfully
   away from him, and sought, as it were designedly, to extinguish true
   religion. Nor was it to be wondered at, that so grievous and severe a
   sentence was pronounced on them; for they had been taught by the law
   how God was to be served. How was it, then, that errors so gross had
   crept in? Doubtless, God had kindled the light of celestial truth,
   which clearly showed the way of true religion; but as men ever seek to
   perform some frivolous trifles, the Israelites and the Jews, when they
   felt ashamed openly and manifestly to reject the true God, labored at
   the same time to add many ceremonies, that their impiety might be thus
   concealed. This is the reason why the Prophet says that they turned
   back; that is, that they could not be excused on the ground of
   ignorance, but that they were perfidious and apostates, who had
   preferred their own idols to the true God; though they knew that he
   could not be rightly worshipped, but according to the rule prescribed
   in the law, they yet neglected this, and heaped together many
   superstitions.

   And, doubtless, we shall find that the fountain of all false worship is
   this--that men are unwilling truly and from the heart to serve God;
   and, at the same time, they wish to retain some appearance of religion.
   For there is nothing omitted in the law that is needful for the perfect
   worship of God: but as God requires in the law a spiritual worship,
   hence it is that men seek hiding-places, and devise for themselves many
   ceremonies, that they may turn back from God, and yet pretend that they
   come to him. While they sedulously labor in their own ceremonies, it is
   indeed true that the worship of God and religion are continually on
   their lips: but, as I have said, it is all hypocrisy and deception; for
   they accumulate ceremonies, that there might be something intervening
   between God and them. It is not, therefore, without reason that the
   Prophet here accuses the Jews that they turned back from Jehovah, and
   that they sought him not. How so? For there was no need of a long, or
   of a difficult, or of a perplexed enquiry; for the Lord had freely
   offered himself to them. How, then, was it that they were blind in the
   midst of light, except that they knowingly and willfully followed their
   own inventions? [72]

   The same is the case at this day with the Papists: for though they may
   glamour a hundred times that they seek to worship God, it is quite
   evident that they willfully go astray; inasmuch as they so delight
   themselves with their own inventions, that they do not purely and from
   the heart devote and consecrate themselves to God.

   We now, then, see that this verse was added, as an explanation, by the
   Prophet, that he might deprive the Jews of their false plea of
   ignorance, and show that they sinned willfully; for they would have
   been sufficiently taught by the law, had they not adopted their own
   inventions, which dazzled their eyes and all their senses. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [72] Calvin has omitted to notice the last words in the verse, "Nor
   enquire of him;" which Henderson, adopting a modern phraseology, has
   rendered, "nor apply to him." The reading ought to be, as many MSS.
   have it, [drsvhv]. The verb means to enquire of, to consult, and also
   to regard or to care for. They did not enquire of God as to his will,
   or they did not show any regard for him. See Genesis 25: 22; Ezekiel
   20:1; and also Deuteronomy 11:12; Job 3:4. To seek the Lord is to seek
   his favor and communion with him; to enquire of the Lord is to seek the
   knowledge of his will in any difficulty.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 1:7-9

   7. Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God: for the day of the
   Lord is at hand: for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid
   his guests.

   7. Tace a facie Domini Jehovae, quia propinquus dies Jehova, quia
   paravit Jehova sacrificium, (vel, ordinavit, [zykh],) sanctificavit
   invitatos suos.

   8. And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice, that I
   will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are
   clothed with strange apparel.

   8. Et erit, in die sacrificii Jehovae tunc visitabo super Principes, et
   super filios Regis, et super omnes qui induti sunt vestitu extraneo.

   9. In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the
   threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.

   9. Et visitabo super omnem qui tripudiat super limen in die illo, qui
   replent domum dominorum suorum violentia et fraude.


   The Prophet confirms here what he has previously taught, when he bids
   all to be silent before God; for this mode of speaking is the same as
   though he had said, that he did not terrify the Jews in vain, but
   seriously set before them God's judgment, which they would find by
   experience to be even more than terrible. He also records some of their
   sins, that the Jews might know that he did not threaten them for
   nothing, but that there were just causes why God declared that he would
   punish them. This is the substance of the whole.

   Let us first see what the Prophet means by the word, silence. Something
   has been said of this on the second chapter of Habakkuk. We said then
   that by silence is meant submission; and to make the thing more clear,
   we said that we were to notice the contrast between the silence to
   which men calmly submit, and the contumacy, which is ever clamorous:
   for when men seek to be wise of themselves, and acquiesce not in God's
   word, it is then said, that they are not silent, for they refuse to
   give a hearing to his word; and when men give loose reins to their own
   will, they observe no bounds. Until God then obtains authority in the
   world, all places are full of clamor, and the whole life of men is in a
   state of confusion, for they run to and fro in their wanderings; and
   there is no restraint where God is not heard. It is for the same reason
   that the Prophet now demands silence: but the expression is
   accommodated to the subject which he handles. To be silent at the
   presence of God, it is true, is to submit to God's authority; but the
   connection is to be considered; for Zephaniah saw then that God's
   judgment was despised and regarded as nothing; and he intimates here
   that God had so spoken, that the execution was nigh at hand. Hence he
   says, Be silent, [73] that is, Know ye, that I have not spoken merely
   for the purpose of terrifying you; but as God is prepared to execute
   vengeance, of this he now reminds you, that if there be any hope of
   repentance, ye may in time seek to return into favor with him; if not,
   that ye may be without excuse.

   We now then understand why the Prophet bids them to be silent before
   the Lord Jehovah: and the context is a confirmation of the same view;
   for the reason is added, Because the day of Jehovah is nigh. For
   profane men ever promise to themselves some respite, and think that
   they gain much by delay: the Prophet, on the contrary, does now expose
   to scorn this self-security, and says, that the day of Jehovah was nigh
   at hand. It is then the same thing as though he had said, that his
   judgment ought to have been quickly anticipated, and even with fear and
   trembling.

   He afterwards employs a metaphor to set forth what he taught,--that God
   had prepared a sacrifice, yea, that he had already appointed and set
   apart his guests. By the word, sacrifice, the Prophet reminded them,
   that the punishment of which he had spoken would be just, and that the
   glory of God would thereby shine forth. We indeed know how ready the
   world is to make complaints; when it is pressed by God's hand, it
   expostulates on account of too much rigor; and many in an open manner
   give utterance to their blasphemies. As then they own not God's justice
   in his punishment, the Prophet calls it a sacrifice; and sacrifices, we
   know, are evidences of divine worship, and he who offers a sacrifice to
   God, owns him to be just. So also by this kind of speaking Zephaniah
   intimates that God would not act a cruel part in cutting off the city
   Jerusalem and its inhabitants; for this would be a sacrifice, according
   to the language often employed by the Prophets, and especially by
   Isaiah, who says of Bozrah, A sacrifice is prepared in Bozrah,' Isaiah
   34:6;) and who says also of Jerusalem itself, Oh! Ariel! Ariel!' Isaiah
   29:1, where Jerusalem itself is represented as the altar; as though he
   had said, In all the streets, in the open places, there shall be altars
   to me; for I will collect together great masses of men, whom I shall
   slay as a sacrifice to me. For all who were not willing to render
   worship to God, and who did not freely offer themselves as spiritual
   victims to him, were to be drawn to the slaughter, and were at the same
   time called sacrifices. So the executions on the gallows, when the
   wicked suffer, may be said to be sacrifices to God: for the Lord arms
   the magistrate with the sword to restrain wickedness, that the wicked
   may not have such liberty as to banish all equity from the world. The
   cities also, which, being forcibly taken, are subject to a slaughter,
   and the fields, where armies are slain, become altars, for God makes
   the rebellious a sacrifice, because they refuse willingly to offer
   themselves.

   So also in this place the Prophet says, Jehovah has prepared for
   himself a sacrifice,--Where? At Jerusalem, through the whole city, as
   it has appeared from the quotation from Isaiah; for as they had not
   rightly sacrificed to God on Mount Sion, but vitiated his whole
   worship, God himself declares, that he would become a priest, that he
   might slay, as he thought right, those beasts, who had obstinately
   refused his yoke: And he has prepared his guests. But I cannot finish
   today.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [73] The word is [ht], and is evidently an interjection enjoining
   silence, Hush! or, Silence! 7. Silence at the presence of the Lord
   Jehovah!
   For nigh is the day of Jehovah,
   For prepared hath Jehovah a sacrifice,
   Selected hath he his guests! The passage is remarkably forcible and
   striking. Jehovah was coming, and everything was prepared, and all were
   to be silent. And then follows what is no less striking and
   expressive,-- 8. And it shall be in the day of Jehovah's sacrifice,
   That I will visit the princes and the king's sons,
   And all who wear foreign apparel.
   9. I will also visit, in that day,
   Every one who leaps on the threshold,
   Who fill the house of their master
   By plunder and by fraud. There is in the last line a metonymy; the act
   is put for what was acquired by it: they filled the house of their
   master by spoils gained by plunder or violence, and by fraud or
   cheating.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we continue in so many ways to provoke
   against us thy wrath, we may patiently bear the punishment, by which
   thou wouldest correct our faults, and also anticipate thy judgment: and
   since thou art pleased to recall us in due time to thyself, let us not
   turn deaf ears to thy counsels, but so obey and submit ourselves to
   thee, that we may become partakers of that mercy, which thou offerest
   to us, provided we seek to be reconciled to thee, and so proceed in thy
   service, that under the government of Christ thy Son, whom thou hast
   appointed to be our supreme and only king, we may so strive to be
   wholly devoted to thee that thou mayest be glorified through our whole
   life, until we become at length partakers of that celestial glory,
   which has been procured for us by the blood of thy only-begotten Son.
   Amen

   Lecture One Hundred and Twentieth

   We stated yesterday why God compares the slaughter of the wicked to a
   sacrifice,--because in punishing the ungodly, he shows himself to be
   the judge of the world: and this slaying is a sacrifice of sweet odour,
   because it makes known this glory. And he immediately adds, that he had
   prepared his guests. The word he uses is qds, kodash, which means to
   sanctify, but is often to be taken in a different sense. It may be
   explained as meaning, that God had prepared his guests: but as there is
   an express mention made of sacrifice, Zephaniah, I have no doubt,
   continues the same metaphor. The meaning then is, that the Chaldeans,
   who were ministers of God's vengeance, were already not only chosen for
   the purpose of executing it, but were divinely consecrated for that
   end: and this unwelcome saying was uttered by the Prophet, that he
   might more sharply touch the feelings of his own nation. The Jews ought
   indeed to have acknowledged God's judgment even when executed by
   heathens; but this they would not have done, had they not understood,
   that these were, in exercising their cruelty, as it were, the priests
   of God; for the royal priesthood at Jerusalem had been profaned. We now
   then see why the Prophet says, that those were sanctified by the Lord
   who had been invited to feed on the flesh of the chosen people, as they
   were wont to eat of the remainder of their sacrifices on festal days.
   [74] Let us now proceed.

   I yesterday repeated this verse, And it shall be, on the day of the
   sacrifice of Jehovah, that I will then visit the princes, and the sons
   of the king, and those who are clothed with strange apparel. The
   Prophet shows, that he not only threatened the common people, but also
   the chief leaders, so that he spared not even the king's sons. He
   attacks then here the principal men among the people; for they were
   justly led to punishment in the first place, as they had been to others
   the cause of their errors. We indeed know, that they who excel in
   dignity give a much greater offense when they abuse their power in
   promoting what is sinful. Hence it was, that God seemed often to have
   sent his Prophets to them only. For though the low and the humble in
   the community were not exempt from punishment, yet it was but
   reasonable that God should more severely punish their leaders. Hence
   the Prophet now says, that God would visit the princes and the king's
   sons [75] He did not indeed intend here to flatter obscure men, as
   though God meant to overlook them: but as the king and his counselors
   had more grievously sinned, the more angry was God with them. We also
   know, that kings and others, who exercise power, are not easily moved,
   for the splendor of their fortune blinds them; and they think that they
   are in a manner exempt from laws, because they occupy a higher station.
   We now then see why the Prophet speaks especially of the princes and
   the king's sons.

   He also adds, And those who wear foreign apparel [76] Some refer this
   to the worshipers of Baal, or his priests; but the context does not
   allow us to apply it to any but to courtiers, whose great delight was
   in apparel: for what Christ says is proved by the experience of all
   ages to be too true,--that they who wear soft clothing are in king's
   courts. Matthew 11:8. And it is probable, that courtiers, through a
   foolish affectation, often changed their clothes; as it is the case
   with men who seek to appear great, they devise daily some new way for
   spending money; and though they may be more splendidly clothed than
   needful, yet they think it almost too sordid to wear the same apparel
   for a whole month; and that their prodigality may be more evident, they
   change also the forms of their dress. This affectation prevails far too
   much at this day in the world. But even then in the age of the Prophet,
   as it appears, the courtiers and those who had power among the people,
   often changed their dress, that they might the more display their pomp
   and attract the admiration of the simple and poor people. And it was
   not simple ambition, but it brought with it a contempt for others; for
   the rich in this way upbraided the poor, that they themselves were
   alone worthy of this superfluity and opulence. It was not enough for
   them, that they were clothed for their own comfort, and also that
   ornament and splendor were added; but they would have willingly made
   bare all others: and as it was a shame to do this, they yet showed, as
   far as they could, by their superfluous abundance, that they were alone
   worthy of such display. It was then no wonder that the Lord threatened
   them with so much severity.

   As this vice in course of time had greatly increased, this passage of
   the Prophet deserves particular notice. And the more luxurious men
   become and the more they indulge in such varieties, and thus manifest
   their pride, the more carefully we ought to learn to restrain the
   desires of our flesh, that they may not leap over the bounds of
   moderation; and let those who abound in wealth be contented with what
   is modest and becoming; and let them especially abstain from that
   absurd affectation, which the Prophet evidently condemns here. It may
   however have been, that the Jews then sought new and unusual fashions
   as to their clothes from remote countries, like the French at this day,
   who delight in the Turkish habit; for they have too much intercourse
   with Turkey. So also at that time a foolish desire had possessed the
   hearts of the people, so as to wish to ingratiate themselves with the
   Chaldeans, and to make friends of them by a likeness in dress. And we
   may learn this from a passage in Ezekiel, where he compares them to
   harlots or to foolish lovers Ezekiel 23:2, etc.:) for as lovers paint
   harlots on walls, and whoremongers and adulterers do the same; so
   Ezekiel accuses the Jews, that they were so inflamed with a mad desire
   of making a covenant with the Chaldean nation, that they had their
   images painted in their chambers. They also no doubt imitated their
   dress, in order to show that they regarded it a great happiness, if
   they became their friends and confederates.

   Now follows what I repeated also yesterday, I will visit every one who
   danceth on the threshold. Some explain this of the worshipers of Baal,
   but improperly; for as I have already said, the context will not allow
   us to understand this except of the servants of princes, who cruelly
   harassed the people and deprived helpless men of their property, who
   were not able to resist them. The Prophet then, after having spoken of
   the chief governors of the kingdom and of the king's sons, now comes to
   their servants, who, like hunting dogs, were ready to seize everywhere
   on the prey. They who understand this to be said of the sacrifices of
   Baal, adduce a passage from sacred history,--that since the image of
   Dagon had been found on the threshold of the temple, they dared not to
   tread on the threshold, but leaped over it: but this is too
   far-fetched. Others also bring expositions of a different kind; but the
   Prophet, I have no doubt, refers here to the liberty they took in
   plundering, when he says, that they danced on the threshold, as persons
   triumphing; for he afterwards adds, that they filled, by rapine and
   fraud, the houses of the princes. To leap or dance then on the
   threshold is no other thing than to take possession of the houses of
   other people, and insolently to triumph over them, as it is usually
   done by conquerors. For he who takes possession of what belongs to
   another, does not quietly rest there as in his own habitation, but
   boasts and exults. So also here, the Prophet paints to the life that
   wantonness, which the servants of princes showed, when they entered
   into the houses of others. He therefore says, that they danced, and
   said, This is my house; and who will dare to say a word to the
   contrary? Since then the servants of princes took so much liberty, the
   Prophet here denounces on them the vengeance of God. [77]

   He then adds, that they filled their masters' houses by rapine and
   fraud. By rapine and fraud he means the prey gathered, partly by armed
   force, and partly by deceit and craft; for courtiers have their nets by
   which they lay in wait for helpless men. But if they cannot obtain by
   fraud what they hope for, they leave recourse to armed force. However
   this may be, they enrich themselves, sometimes by plundering, and
   sometimes by fraud. Hence the Prophet mentions both here. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [74] The first idea of the verb [qds], is evidently to set apart, to
   separate either men or things for a certain purpose. For this meaning
   Parkhurst refers to Leviticus 20:24, compared with version 26, and to
   Deuteronomy 19:2,7, compared with Joshua 20:7. This idea seems the most
   suitable here, "I have set apart (or selected) my guests." Newcome
   renders it "appointed," and Henderson, "consecrated," as Calvin does.
   "Segregavit--set apart," is the version of Drusius, and Junius has
   "preparavit--prepared." When the verb is followed by "war," it is
   rendered "prepare" in our version. See Jeremiah 6:4; Joel 3:9; Micah
   3:5. The explanation given by Theodosius is aphorise--he separated or
   selected.--Ed.

   [75] This was a prophecy: though the king Josiah had no children at
   this time, yet he had some afterwards; and they proved themselves
   deserving of the judgment here announced, and it was inflicted on them.
   Henderson's objection, that as Josiah had then no children, the
   prophecy could not apply to them personally, seems wholly inadmissable:
   it was a prophecy.--Ed.

   [76] Or, literally, "the garment of a foreigner or stranger," [nkry].
   The singular is used poetically for the plural, instead of "the
   garments of foreigners."--Ed.

   [77] Marckius, following the Septuagint, and some of the fathers,
   Cyril, Theodoret, Jerome, etc., think that the thoughtless intruders
   into the temple are here meant, and such as brought there as sacrifices
   and gifts the fruits of plunder and fraud. But the passage cannot
   possibly bear this meaning according to the Hebrew text: nor is such a
   meaning consistent with the context. The view given here is that of
   Kimki, Drusius, Newcome, and Henderson.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 1:10

   10. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that there
   shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the
   second, and a great crashing from the hills.

   10. Et erit in die illa, dicit Iehova, vox clamoris a porta piscium, et
   ululatus a secundda (ad verbum; sed multi intelligunt scholam,) et
   contritio magna a collibus.


   He confirms here the same truth, and amplifies and illustrates it by a
   striking description; for we know how much a lively representation
   avails to touch the feelings, when the event itself is not only
   narrated, but placed as it were before our eyes. So the Prophet is not
   content with plain words, but presents a scene, that the future
   destruction of Jerusalem might appear in a clearer light. But as I have
   elsewhere explained this mode of speaking, I shall not dwell on the
   subject now.

   He says, that there would be the voice of crying from the gate of the
   fishes. He names here three places in Jerusalem, and afterwards he adds
   a fourth. But as we do not understand the situation of the city,
   sufficient for us is this probable conjecture,--that he refers to parts
   opposite to one another; as though he had said, that no corner of the
   city would be in a quiet state, when the Lord roused up war. Let us
   then suppose it to be triangular, and let the gate of the fishes be one
   side, and let the second gate or the school be on the other; and let
   the part nigh the hills form the third side. What some say, that the
   hills mean palaces, I do not approve of; nor is it consistent with the
   context: but we ought to bear in mind what I have already stated, that
   the Prophet here denounces ruin on every part of the city, so that the
   Jews would in vain seek refuges for themselves; for by running here and
   there, they would find all places full of crying and howling. There
   shall be then the voice of crying from the gate of the fishes. Why the
   Prophet calls it the gate of the fishes we cannot for certainty say,
   except that it is a probable conjecture, that either some fish-pond was
   near it, or that the fish-market was nigh.

   As to the word msnh, meshene, the majority of interpreters think that
   it means the place where the priests explained the law and devoted
   themselves to the study of it; and they adduce a passage from 2 Kings
   22:14, where it seems, as there is mention made of priests, the word is
   taken in this sense. But as gates are spoken of here, and as the
   Hebrews often call whatever is second in order by this word, as the
   second part in buildings and also in towns and in other places, is thus
   called, we may take it here in this sense, that is, as meaning that
   gate which was next to the first in general esteem. But as the subject
   has little to do with the main point, I dismiss it. [78]

   He says in the last place, that there would be a great breach in the
   hills. He refers, I have no doubt, to that part of the city which was
   contiguous to the mountains. However this may be, it was the Prophet's
   object to include here the whole city, that he might shake off from the
   Jews all vain confidence, and show that there would be no escape, when
   the Lord stretched forth his hand to punish their sins. It now
   follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [78] Junius, Piscator, Newcome, and Henderson think that it means the
   second city, a part of Jerusalem, being so called, as they supposed, in
   Nehemiah 11:9: where our version is considered to be wrong, and the
   clause ought to be, "and Judah, the son of Jeruiah, was over the second
   city"--[msnh l-hyr]. So it is deemed improperly rendered "college" in 2
   Kings 22:14 and 2 Chronicles 34:22; where it ought to be "in the second
   city." But the passage in Nehemiah is not decisive on the subject; and
   our version is countenanced by the former part of the verse, where
   "Joel" is said to be the "overseer," and "Judah" is mentioned as being
   next to him, the second in office: and it is so rendered in the
   Septuagint. As to the other text, the word is by itself as here. What
   Calvin, after Cyril and Theodoret, suggests, is the most probable
   solution. The word rendered by Calvin "contritio--breach," and by
   Henderson, "destruction," is [svr]. As "crying" and "howling" are said
   to proceed from the other parts, so something similar must have
   proceeded from "the hills." The word means breaking, and it is often
   applied to the heart--"a broken heart," Psalm 34:18; 51:19, etc. It
   seems to mean here the breaking out into weeping and wailing. The
   parallelism of the verse would thus be complete-- And there shall be in
   that day, saith Jehovah,
   The voice of crying from the fish-gate,
   And howling from the second gate,
   And great wailing from the hills. Wailing is the breaking out of
   anguish and pangs. The word is used in Ezekiel 21:6, for acute pain in
   the loins, and may be considered as used here metonymically.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 1:11

   11. Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are
   cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.

   11. Ululate habitatores loci concavi; quia exterminatus est populos
   mercatorum, excisi sunt omnes onusti pecunia.


   The Prophet addresses the merchants here who inhabited the middle part
   of the city, and hence thought themselves farther off from all danger
   and trouble. As then they were concealed as it were in their
   hiding-places, they thought that no danger was nigh them; and thus
   security blinded them the more. After having spoken of the king's
   palace and of the princes and their servants, Zephaniah now turns his
   discourse to the merchants.

   And he calls them the inhabitants of the hollow place, mkts, mecatesh.
   The verb kts, catash, means to be hollow; hence the Hebrews call a
   hollow place mkts, mecatesh. So Solomon calls a mortar by this name,
   because it is hollow: [79] and we learn also from other parts of
   scripture that the word means sometimes either a cavern or some low
   place. But we know that merchants have for the most part their streets
   on level ground, and it is for their advantage, as they have goods to
   carry. It may then have been, that at Jerusalem there was a large
   company of merchants in that part of the city, which was in its
   situation low. But they who regard it as a proper name, bring nothing
   either of reason or probability to confirm their opinion: and it is
   also evident from the context that merchants are here addressed, for
   cut off, he says, is the mercantile people. The word knn, canon, means
   a merchant. Some think that the Jews are here, as often elsewhere,
   called Canaan, because they were become degenerate, and more like the
   Canaanites than the holy fathers, from whom they descended. [80] But
   the Prophet speaks here no doubt of merchants, for an explanation
   immediately follows, all who are laden with money. And he says that
   merchants were laden with money, because they would not transact
   business without making payments and counting money, and also, because
   merchants for the most part engrossed by their gainful arts a great
   portion of the wealth of the world.

   We now then understand what the Prophet means: He threatens howling to
   the merchants, who were concealed in their hidden places, for they
   occupied that part of the city, as I have already said, which was below
   the hills; and he then makes use of the word knn, canon, a trafficker;
   and lastly he speaks of their wealth, as it is probable that they
   became rich through frauds and most dishonest means, and shows that
   their money would be useless to them, for they would find in it no
   defense, when the Lord extended his hand to punish them. It now
   follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [79] This original meaning of the word is much more probable than what
   lexicographers generally give. The braying or pounding is evidently
   derived from the noun, and the noun from the form of the mortar. Most
   agree that the word here means the lower part of the city--the hollow,
   from the circumstance of being surrounded by hills. The "hills" were
   those on which a part of the city was built, such as Zion, Moriah and
   Ophal.--Ed.

   [80] This opinion has been entertained, because the Jews are so called
   in Hosea 12:8. That the word means a trader or merchant is evident from
   Job 41:6, (in the Hebrew Bibles, 40:30;) Isaiah 23:8; Ezekiel 17:4. In
   the last passage it is rendered "traffic" in our version; and it may be
   so rendered here--"all the people of traffic," or of trade. The version
   of Newcome is, "all the trafficking people." The verse may be thus
   literally rendered,-- Howl ye, the inhabitants of the lower part,
   For reduced to silence have been all the people of trade,
   Cut off have been all the laden with silver. They are called to howl,
   as though their calamity had already taken place, a mode of speaking
   often used by the Prophets. That the event was future is clear from the
   context, especially from the next verse. "Reduced to silence"--[ndmh],
   is literally the meaning, not "destroyed;" and appropriate is the term,
   as people of trade create much bustle and noise. "The laden with
   silver," may be rendered, as Newcome does, "the bearers of silver:" and
   silver is here for money.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 1:12

   12. And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search
   Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their
   lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will
   he do evil.

   12. Et erit in tempore illo, serutabor Ierusalem in lucernis, et
   visitabo super homines, qui congelati sunt in faecibus suis, et dicunt
   in cordibus suis, Neque benefaciet Iehova, neque malefaciet.


   The Prophet addresses here generally the despisers of God, who were
   become hardened in their wickedness. But before he openly names them,
   he says that the visitation would be such, that God would search every
   corner, so that no place would remain unexplored. For to visit with
   candles, or to search with candles, is so to examine all hidden places
   or coverts, that nothing may escape. When one intends to plunder a
   city, he first enters into the houses, and takes away whatever he
   finds; but when he thinks that there are some hidden treasures, he
   descends into the secret cells; and then if there be no light there, he
   lights a candle, and carefully looks here and there, that he may not
   overlook anything. By this comparison then God intimates, that
   Jerusalem would be so plundered, that nothing whatever would remain.
   Hence he says, I will search it with candles. We indeed know that
   nothing is hid from God; but it is evident, that he is constrained to
   borrow comparisons from the common practice of men, because he could
   not otherwise express what is necessary for us to know. The world
   indeed deal with God as men do with one another; for they think that he
   can be deceived by their craftiness. He therefore laughs to scorn this
   folly, and says, that he would have candles to search out whatever was
   concealed.

   Now, as impiety had possessed the minds of almost all the people, he
   says, I will visit the men, who on their lees are congealed. This may
   indeed be only understood of the rich, who flattered themselves in
   their prosperity, and feared nothing, and were thus congealed on their
   lees: but Zephaniah shows in the words which follow, that he had in
   view something more atrocious, that is, that they said that neither
   good nor evil proceeded from God. At the same time, these two things
   may be suitably joined together--that he reproves here their
   self-security, produced by wealth--and that he also accuses the
   careless Jews of that gross contempt of God which is afterwards
   mentioned. And I am disposed to take this view, that is, that the Jews,
   inebriated with prosperity, became hardened, as men contract hardness
   often by labor--and that they so collected lees through too much
   quietness and abundance of things, that they became wholly stupid, and
   could be touched by no truth made known to them. Hence in the first
   place the Prophet says, that God would visit with punishment a
   carelessness so extreme, when men not only slumbered in their
   prosperity, but also became congealed in their own stupidity, so as to
   be almost void of sense and understanding. When one addresses a dead
   mass, he can effect nothing: and so the Prophet compares careless men
   to a dead and congealed mass; for stupidity had so bound up all their
   senses, that they could not be either allured by the goodness of God,
   or terrified by his threatenings. Congealing then is nothing else but
   that hardness or contumacy, which is contracted by self-indulgences,
   and particularly when the minds of men become almost stupefied. [81]
   And by lees he means sinful indulgences, which so infatuate all the
   senses of men, that no light nor sincerity remains.

   He then mentions what they said in their hearts. He expresses here what
   that carelessness which he condemned brings with it--even that wicked
   men fearlessly mock God. What it is to speak in the heart, is evident
   from many parts of Scripture; it means to determine anything within:
   for though the ungodly do not openly proclaim what they determine in
   their minds, they yet reason within themselves, and settle this
   point--that either there is no God, or that he rests idly in heaven.
   Said has the ungodly in his heart, No God is.' Why in the heart?
   Because shame or fear prevents men from openly avowing their impiety;
   yet they cherish such thoughts in the heart and assent to them. Now
   here is described by the Prophet the height of impiety, when he says,
   that men drunk with pleasures robbed God of his office as a judge,
   saying, that he does neither good nor evil. And it is probable that
   there were then many at Jerusalem and throughout Judea who thus
   insolently despised God as a judge. But Zephaniah especially speaks of
   the chief men; for such above all others deride God, as the giants did,
   and look down as from on high on his judgments. There is indeed much
   insensibility among the common people; but there is more madness in the
   pride of great men, who, trusting in their power, think themselves
   exempt from the authority of God.

   But what I have just said must be borne in mind, that an unhealable
   impiety is described by the Prophet, when he accuses the Jews, that
   they did not think God to be the author either of good or of evil;
   because God is thus deprived of his dignity; for except he is owned as
   the judge of the world, what becomes of his dignity? The majesty, or
   the authority, or the glory of God does not consist in some imaginary
   brightness, but in those works which so necessarily belong to him, that
   they cannot be separated from his very essence. It is what peculiarly
   belongs to God, to govern the world, and to exercise care over mankind,
   and also to make a difference between good and evil, to help the
   miserable, to punish all wickedness, to check injustice and violence.
   When any one takes away these things from God, he leaves him an idol
   only. Since, then, the glory of God consists in his justice, wisdom,
   judgment, power, and other attributes, all who deny God to be the
   governor of the world entirely extinguish, as much as they can, his
   glory. Even so do heathen writers accuse Epicures; for as he dared not
   to deny the existence of some god, like Diagoras and some others, he
   confessed that there are some gods, but shut them up in heaven, that
   they might enjoy there their leisure and delights. But this is to
   imagine a god, who is not a god. It is then no wonder that the Prophet
   condemns with so much sharpness the stupidity of the Jews, as they
   thought that neither good nor evil proceeded from God. But there was
   also a greater reason why God should be so indignant at such
   senselessness: for whence was it that men entertained such an opinion
   or such a delirious thought, as to deny that God did either good or
   evil, except that they attempted to drive God far away from them, that
   they might not be subject to his judgment. They therefore who seek to
   extinguish the distinction between right and wrong in their
   consciences, invent for themselves the delirious notion, that God
   concerns not himself with human affairs, that he is contented with his
   own celestial felicity, and descends not to us, and that adversity as
   well as prosperity happens to men by chance.

   We hence see how men seek willfully and designedly to indulge the
   notion, that neither good nor evil comes from God: they do this, that
   they may stupefy their own consciences, and thus precipitate themselves
   with greater liberty into sin, as though they were free to do anything
   with impunity, and as though there was no judge to whom an account is
   to be rendered.

   And hence I have said, that it is the very summit of impiety when men
   strengthen themselves in this error, that God rests in heaven, and that
   whatever miseries they endure in this world happen through fortunes and
   that whatever good things they have are to be ascribed either to their
   own industry or to chance. And so the Prophet briefly shows in this
   passage that the Jews were past recovery, that no one might feel
   surprised, that God should punish with so much severity a people who
   had been his friends, and whom he had adopted in preference to the
   whole world: for he had set apart the race of Abraham, as it is well
   known, as his chosen and holy people. God's vengeance on the children
   of Abraham might have appeared cruel or extremely rigid, had it not
   been expressly declared that they had advanced so far in impiety as to
   seek to exclude God from the government of the world, and to deprive
   him of his own peculiar office, even that of punishing sin, of
   defending his own people, of delivering them from all evils, of
   relieving all their miseries. Since, then, they thus shut up God in
   heaven, and gave the governing power on earth to fortune, it was an
   intolerable stupidity, nay, wholly diabolical. It was therefore no
   wonder that God was so severely indignant, and stretched forth his hand
   to punish their sin, as their disease had become now incurable.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [81] There is a similar meaning in Jeremiah 48:11; but the verb is
   different, [sqt], which means to be still, to rest, to settle, while
   the verb here is [qph'], which signifies to be condensed, or to be
   congealed, Exodus 15:8. But as things congelaed become fixed, the verb
   seems to have the meaning of fixedness here; as wines on the lees, to
   which allusion is made, do not become congealed, the comparison seems
   to be, that as wine kept still on the lees increases in strength and
   flavor so the Jews, settling on their dregs--their sins--became
   strengthened and confirmed in their wickedness and atheistic notions.
   But Newcome and Henderson take another view of the metaphor, and
   consider that "the thoughtless tranquillity of the rich is compared to
   the fixed unbroken surface of fermented liquors." Our version favors
   the former idea, as the verb is rendered "settled."--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as almost the whole world breaks out into
   such excesses, that there is no moderation, no reason,--O grant, that
   we may learn not only to confine ourselves within those limits which
   thou dost approve and command, but also to delight and glory in the
   smallness of our portion, inasmuch as the wealth, and honors, and
   pleasures of the world so fascinate the hearts and minds of all, that
   they elevate themselves into heaven, and carry on war, as it were,
   avowedly with thee. Grant also to us, that in our limited portion we
   may be in such a way humbled under thy powerful hand, as never to doubt
   but that thou wilt be our deliverer even in our greatest miseries; and
   that ascribing to thee the power over life and death, we may feel fully
   assured, that whatever afflictions happen to us, proceed from thy just
   judgment, so that we may be led to repentance, and daily exercise
   ourselves in it, until we shall at length come to that blessed rest
   which is laid up for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Zephaniah 1:13

   13. Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a
   desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and
   they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.

   13. Et erit substantia eorum in direptionem, et domus eorum in
   vastitatem; et aedificabunt domos, neque habitabunt; et plantabunt
   vineas, neque bibent vinum earum.


   Zephaniah pursues the same subject--that God, after long forbearance,
   would punish his rebellious and obstinate people. Hence he says, that
   they were now delivered, even by God himself, into the hands of their
   enemies. They indeed knew that many were inimical to them; but they did
   not consider God's judgment, as God himself elsewhere complains--that
   they did not regard the hand of him who smote them. Isaiah 9:13. Our
   Prophet, therefore, declares now that they were given up to
   destruction, and that their enemies would find no trouble nor
   difficulty in invading the land, since all places would be open to
   plunder. And he recites what is found in Leviticus 26:20; for the
   Prophets were interpreters of the law, and the only difference between
   Moses and them is, that they apply his general truth to their own time.
   The Prophet now pursues this course, as though he had said, that God
   had not in vain or to no purpose threatened this evil in his law; for
   the Jews would find by experience that this would really be the case,
   and that it had been truly said, that the fruit of the land, their
   habitations, and other comforts of life, would be transferred to
   others. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 1:14

   14. The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly,
   even the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there
   bitterly.

   14. Propinquus dies Jehovae magnus, propinquus et festinans valde; vox
   diei Jehovae amara (ut alii vertunt,) vociferabitur illic fortis (vel,
   amarum, aut, amare illic vociferabitur fortis; alii secus ditinguunt,
   Vox diei Jehovae amara vociferabitur, aut, amare; postea, illic
   fortis.)


   The Prophet in this verse expresses more clearly what I have already
   stated--That God would be the author of all the evils which would
   happen to the Jews; for as they grew more insensible in their sins,
   they more and more provoked God's wrath against themselves. It is
   therefore no common wisdom to consider God's hand when he strikes or
   chastens us. This is the reason why the Prophet now calls the attention
   of the Jews to God, that they might not fix their minds, as it is
   commonly done, on men only. At the same time, he tries to shake off
   their torpor by declaring that the day would be terrible, and that it
   was also now near at hand. We indeed know that hypocrites trifle with
   God, except they feel the weight of his wrath, and that they protract
   time, and promise themselves so long a respite, that they never awake
   to repentance. Hence the Prophet in the first place shows, that
   whatever evils then impended over the Jews were not only from men, but
   especially from God. This is one thing; and then, in order thoroughly
   to touch stupid hearts, he says, that the day would be terrible; and
   lastly, that they might not deceive themselves by vain flatteries, he
   declares that the day was at hand. These three things must be noticed
   in order that we understand the Prophet's object.

   But he says at the beginning of the verse, that the great day of
   Jehovah was nigh. In these words he includes the three things to which
   I have already referred. By calling it the day of Jehovah, he means,
   that whatever evils the Jews suffered, ought to have been ascribed to
   his judgment; and by calling it the great day, his object was to strike
   terror; as well as by saying, in the third place, that it was nigh. We
   hence see that three things are included in these words. But the
   Prophet more fully explains what might, on account of the brevity of
   his words, have seemed not quite clear.

   Near, he says, is the day, and quickly hastens. Men, we know, are wont
   to extend time, that they may cherish their sins; for though they
   cannot divest themselves of every feeling as to religion, or shake it
   off, they yet imagine for themselves a long distance between them and
   God; and by such an imagination they find ease for themselves. Hence
   the Prophet declares the day to be nigh; and as it was hardly credible
   that the destruction of which he spake was near, he adds, that the day
   was quickly hastening; as though he had said, that they ought not to
   judge by the present state of things what God would do, for in a moment
   his wrath would pass through from east to west like lightning. Men need
   long preparation when they determine to execute their vengeance; but
   God has no need of much preparation, for his own power is sufficient
   for him when he resolves to destroy the wicked. We now, then, see why
   it was added by the Prophet, that the day would quickly hasten.

   He now repeats that the day of Jehovah and his voice would cry out
   bitterly. I have stated three renderings as given by interpreters. Some
   read thus--The day of Jehovah shall be bitter; there the strong shall
   cry aloud. This meaning is admissible, and a useful instruction may
   from it be elicited; as though the Prophet had said, that no courage
   could bring help to men, or be an aid to them, against God's vengeance.
   Others give this rendering, that the day would bitterly cry out, for
   there would be the strong, that is, the strength of enemies would break
   down whatever courage the Jews might have. But this second meaning
   seems forced; and I am disposed to adopt the third--that the voice of
   the day of Jehovah would bitterly cry out. And he means the voice of
   those who would have really to know God as a judge, whom they had
   previously despised; for God would then put forth his power, which had
   been an object of contempt, until the Jews had by experience felt it.
   [82]

   As to the Prophet's design, there is no ambiguity: for he seeks here to
   rouse the Jews from their insensibility, who had so hardened themselves
   against all threatening, that the Prophets were not able to convince
   them. Since, then, they had thus hardened themselves against every
   instruction and all warnings, the Prophet here says, that the voice of
   God's day would be different: for God's voice had sounded through the
   mouth of the Prophets, but it availed not with the deaf. An awful
   change is here announced; for the Jews shall then cry aloud, as the
   roaring of the divine voice shall then terrify them, when God shall
   really show that he is the avenger of wickedness--When therefore he
   shall ascend his tribunal, then ye shall cry. His messengers now cry to
   you in vain, for ye close up your ears; ye shall cry in your turn, but
   it will be in vain.

   But if one prefers to take it as one sentence, The voice of the day of
   Jehovah, there strong, shall bitterly cry out, the meaning will be the
   same as to the main point. I would not, therefore, contend about words,
   provided we bear in mind what I have already said--that Zephaniah sets
   here the cry of the distressed people in opposition to the voices of
   the Prophets, which they had despised, yea, and for the most part, as
   it appears from other places, treated with ridicule. However this may
   have been, he indirectly condemns their false confidence, when he
   speaks of the strong; as though he had said, that they were strong only
   for their own ruin, while they opposed God and his servants; for this
   strength falls at length, nay, it breaks itself by its own weight, when
   God rises to judgment. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [82] The Rabbinical punctuation has destroyed the simplicity of this
   passage by connecting "bitter" with the latter clause. Jerome,
   Pagninus, Newcome, as well as the Septuagint, connect it with the
   former clause. The literal rendering of the two lines is as follows--
   The voice of the day of Jehovah shall be grievous;
   Roar out there (or then) shall the brave. "The voice of the day," etc.,
   means the voice uttered on that day, as Drusius explains it. [mr] is no
   doubt "bitter;" but it is often applied in scripture to express what is
   grievous, afflictive, or sorrowful. If we render [st], "there," it
   refers to Jerusalem, verse 12; but it is sometimes used as an adverb of
   time, "then," see Psalm 14:5; Nehemiah 3:15. "The meaning is," says
   Drusius, "that the voice of that day, which they who excel in strength
   of mind and body shall utter, shall be bitter." The whole verse is
   remarkably concise and emphatical,-- 14. Nigh is the great day of
   Jehovah,
   Nigh and hastening quickly:
   The voice of the day of Jehovah shall be grievous;
   Roar out then shall the brave. Then the following verse is not to
   begin, as in our version, which has been followed by Newcome and
   Henderson, "That day is a day of wrath," but thus-- A day of wrath
   shall be that day. This is the order of the original, and as there is
   no verb, it must be supplied and regulated as to its tense by the
   context.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 1:15, 16

   15. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of
   wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of
   clouds and thick darkness,

   15. Dies excandescentiae, dies ille, dies angustiae et afflictionis,
   dies tumultus, et vastationis, dies tumultus et vastationis, dies
   tenebrarum et caliginis, dies nubis et nebulae;

   16. A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and
   against the high towers.

   16. Dies tubae et clangoris super urbes munitas, et super arces
   excelsas.


   The Prophet shows here how foolish they were who extenuated God's
   vengeance, as hypocrites and all wicked men are wont to do. Hence he
   accuses the Jews of madness, that they thought that the way of
   reconciliation would be easy to them, when they had by their
   perverseness provoked God to come against them as an armed enemy. For
   though the ungodly do not promise to themselves anything of God's
   favor, yet they entertain vain imaginations, as though he might with no
   trouble be pacified: they do not think that he will be propitious to
   them, and yet in the meantime they deride his vengeance. Against this
   kind of senselessness the Prophet now inveighs. We have stated in other
   places, that these kinds of figurative expressions were intended solely
   for this end--to constrain men to entertain some fear, for they
   willfully deluded themselves: for the Prophets had to do, partly with
   open despisers of God, and partly with his masked worshipers, whose
   holiness was hypocrisy.

   This, then, was the reason why he said, that that day would be a day of
   wrath, and also a day of distress and of affliction, [83] of tumult and
   desolation, [84] of darkness and of thick darkness, of clouds and of
   mist. In short, he intended to remove from the Jews that confidence
   with which they flattered themselves, yea, the confidence which they
   derived from their contempt of God: for the flesh is secure, while it
   has coverts, where it may withdraw itself from the presence of God.
   True confidence cannot exceed moderation, that is, the confidence that
   is founded on God's word, for thus men come nigh to God: but the flesh
   wishes for no other rest but in the forgetfulness of God. And we have
   already seen in the Prophet Amos, (Amos 5:18,) why the day of Jehovah
   is painted as being so dreadful; he had, as I have said, to contend
   with hypocrites, who made an improper use of God's name, and at the
   same time slumbered in gross insensibility. Hence Amos said, It will be
   a day, not of light, but of darkness; not of joy, but of sorrow. Why
   then do ye anxiously expect the day of the Lord? For the Jews, glorying
   in being the chosen people of God, and trusting only in their false
   title of adoption, thought that everything was lawful for them, as
   though God had renounced his own authority. And thus hypocrites ever
   flatter themselves, as though they held God bound to them. Our Prophet
   does not, as Amos, distinctly express these sentiments, yet the meaning
   of the words is the same, and that is, that when God ascends his
   tribunal, there is no hope for pardon. He at the same time cuts off
   from them all their vain confidences; for though God excludes all
   escapes, yet hypocrites look here and there, before and behind, to the
   right hand and to the left.

   The Prophet therefore intimates, that there would be everywhere
   darkness and thick darkness, clouds and mists, affliction and
   distress,--Why? because it would be the day of wrath; for God, after
   having borne patiently a long time with the Jews, and seen that they
   perversely abused his patience, would at length put forth his power.
   And that they might not set up their own strongholds against God, he
   says, that war was proclaimed against the fortified cities and high
   citadels. We hence see that he deprives the Jews of all help, in order
   that they might understand that they were to perish, except they
   repented, and thus return into favor with God. It shall then be a day
   of the trumpet and of shouting, [85] --How? on all fortified cities.
   For the Jews, as it is usually done, compared the strength of their
   enemies with their own. It was not their purpose to go forth beyond
   their own borders: and they thought that they would be able to resist,
   and be sufficiently fortified, if any foreign enemy invaded them. The
   Prophet laughs to scorn this notion, for God had declared war against
   their fortified cities. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [83] The original words are similar in sound and meaning; the first,
   [tsrh], comes from a verb which means to inclose, to confine, to
   straiten, and it may be rendered, narrowness, confinement, straitness,
   distress. The other, [mtsvqh], is oppression, as the verb means to
   press down, to press close.

   [84] Waste or confusion is, [msv'h ,s'h], derived from the same root,
   may be rendered desolation. The two next words, "darkness" and "thick
   darkness," occur in Joel 2:2. In the same passage we have also "the day
   of cloudiness and of entire darkness," literally, bare or naked
   darkness; for the word is, [rphl], derived, as I conceive, from [r],
   bare, and ['phl], thick darkness. There is a gradation in the words
   used in each line; the second word is stronger than the first.--Ed.

   [85] Rather "acclamation," the triumphant voice of conquerors. As an
   attempt to preserve the distinctive character of each word in this
   singular passage, I offer the following version-- 15. A day of extreme
   wrath shall be that day,
   A day of distress and oppression,
   A day of waste and of desolation,
   A day of darkness and of thick darkness,
   A day of cloudiness and of entire darkness; 16. A day of the trumpet
   and of acclamation
   Over the cities that are inclosed,
   And over the towers which are lofty. The word [vrh], "extreme wrath,"
   means such wrath as passes over all bounds--overflowing wrath. We are
   obliged to use the word darkness three times for lack of suitable
   terms. The first is the common darkness of the night, the second is a
   grosser darkness, and the third is complete darkness. The words
   "gloominess" and "obscurity," used by Newcome and Henderson, are not
   sufficiently strong, and convey not the meaning.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 1:17

   17. And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind
   men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall
   be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.

   17. Et coarctabo hominem (vel, homines,) et ambulabunt tanquam caeci,
   quia contra Iehovam impie egerunt; et fundetur sanguis quasi pulvis; et
   caro eorum erit tanquam stercora.


   He confirms what I have already stated--that though other enemies, the
   Assyrians or Chaldeans, attacked the Jews, yet God would be the
   principal leader of the war. God then claims here for himself what the
   Jews transferred to their earthly enemies: and the Prophet has already
   often called it the day of Jehovah; for God would then make known his
   power, which had been a sport to them. He therefore declares in this
   place, that he would reduce man to distress, so that the whole nation
   would walk like the blind --that, being void of counsel, they would
   stumble and fall, and not be able to proceed in their course: for they
   are said to go astray like the blind, who see no end to their evils,
   who find no means to escape ruin, but are held as it were fast bound.
   And we must ever bear in mind what I have already said--that the Jews
   were inflated with such pride, that they heedlessly despised all the
   Prophets. Since then they were thus wise in themselves, God denounces
   blindness on them.

   He subjoins the reason, Because they had acted impiously towards
   Jehovah [86] By these words he confirms what I have already
   explained--that the intermediate causes are not to be considered,
   though the Chaldeans took vengeance on the Jews; for there is a higher
   principle, and another cause of this evil, even the contempt of God and
   of his celestial truth; for they had acted impiously towards God. And
   by these words the Prophet reminds the Jews, that no alleviation was to
   be expected, as they had not only men hostile to them, but God himself,
   whom they had extremely provoked.

   Hence he adds, Poured forth shall be your blood as dust [87] They whom
   God delivered up to extreme reproach were deserving of this, because he
   had been despised by them. Their flesh, [88] he says, shall be as dung.
   Now, we know how much the Jews boasted of their preeminence; and God
   had certainly given them occasion to boast, had they made a right and
   legitimate use of his benefits; but as they had despised him, they
   deserved in their turn to be exposed to every ignominy and reproach.
   Hence the Prophet here lays prostrate all their false boastings by
   which they were inflated; for they wished to be honorable, while God
   was despised by them. At last he adds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [86] The Hebrew words are literally, For against Jehovah have they
   sinned. --Ed.

   [87] "Copiously and in contempt," says Marckius; "as a thing of no
   value," says Grotius; "as worthless as dust," says Drusius. The
   comparison is evidently intended to show that their blood, or their
   life, would be treated with contempt, and no more regarded than
   dust.--Ed.

   [88] The word is [lcht], usually rendered food; here it means what is
   fed, the carcass, the body. It is rendered "flesh" by the
   Septuagint.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 1:18

   18. Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them
   in the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by
   the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of
   all them that dwell in the land.

   18. Etiam argentum eorum, etiam aurum eorum, nihil proficiet ad
   liberandos ipsos in die excandescentiae Jehovae, et in igne
   indignationis ejus evorabitur omnis terra; quia consumptionem et quidem
   definitam (vel, horribilem, vel, celerem) facet cum omnibus incolis
   terrae.


   He repeats what he has already said--that the helps which the Jews
   hoped would be in readiness to prevent God's vengeance would be vain.
   For though men dare not openly to resist God, yet they hope by some
   winding courses to find out some way by which they may avert his
   judgment. As then the Jews, trusting in their wealth, and in their
   fortified cities, became insolent towards God, the Prophet here
   declares, that neither gold nor silver should be a help to them. Let
   them, he says, accumulate wealth; though by the mass of their gold and
   silver they form high mountains for themselves, yet they shall not be
   able to turn aside the hand of God, nor be able to deliver
   themselves,--and why? He repeats again the same thing, that it would be
   the day of wrath. We indeed know, that the most savage enemies are
   sometimes pacified by money, for avarice mitigates their cruelty; but
   the Prophet declares here, that as God would be the ruler in that war,
   there would be no redemption, and therefore money would be useless: for
   God could by no means receive them into favor, except they repented and
   truly humbled themselves before him.

   He therefore adds, that the land would be devoured by the fire of God's
   jealousy, or indignation. He compares God's wrath to fire; for no
   agreement can be made when fire rages, but the more materials there are
   the more will there be to increase the fire. So then the Prophet
   excludes the Jews from any hope of deliverance, except they reconciled
   themselves to God by true and sincere repentance; for a consummation,
   he says, he will make as to all the inhabitants of the land, and one
   indeed very quick or speedy. [89] In short, he means, that as the Jews
   had hardened themselves against every instruction, they would find
   God's vengeance to be such as would wholly consume them, as they would
   not anticipate it, but on the contrary enhance it by their pride and
   stupidity, and even deride it. Now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [89] Quickness rather than terror is what is evidently meant. See
   version 14. Most agree in this respect. Newcome renders it "speedy,"
   and Henderson "sudden." The word "riddance," for [klh], in our version,
   is improper. It is rendered "full end" by Newcome, and "consummation"
   by Henderson, and "sunteleian--end" by the Septuagint. The particle
   ['k] does not mean "altogether," as rendered by Henderson, but it is an
   asseveration--surely, indeed, certainly, doubtless. The ['ch] before
   "inhabitants" has evidently here the meaning of kata, with regard to.
   It is rendered epi, upon, in the Septuagint, and "with" by Marckius and
   Newcome. The whole verse is as follows,-- 18. Neither their silver nor
   their gold
   Shall be able to deliver them
   In the day of the extreme-wrath of Jehovah;
   By the fire of his jealousy
   Shall be consumed the whole land;
   For an end, doubtless sudden, will he make,
   As to all the inhabitants of the land.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 2:1, 2

   1. Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not
   desired;

   1. Colligite vos, et colligite gens non amabilis;

   2. Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff,
   before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of
   the Lord's anger come upon you.

   2. Antequam pariat decretum, sicut stipula transibit die, antequam
   veniat super eos furor irae Iehovae, antequam veniat super eos dies
   irae Iehovae.


   The Prophet, after having spoken of God's wrath, and shown how terrible
   it would be, and also how near, now exhorts the Jews to repentance, and
   thus mitigates the severity of his former doctrine, provided their
   minds were teachable. We hence learn that God fulminates in his word
   against men, that he may withhold his hand from them. The more severe,
   then, God is, when he chastises us and makes known our sins, and sets
   before us his wrath, the more clearly he testifies how precious and
   dear to him is our salvation; for when he sees us rushing headlong, as
   it were, into ruin, he calls us back by threatening and chastisements.
   Whenever, then, God condemns us by his word, let us know that he will
   be propitious to us, if, touched with true repentance, we flee to his
   mercy; for to effect this is the design of all his reproofs and
   threatening.

   There follows then a seasonable exhortation, after the Prophet had
   spoken of the dreadfulness of God's vengeance. Gather yourselves, he
   says, gather, ye nation not worthy of being loved. Others read--Search
   among yourselves, search; and interpreters differ as to the root of the
   verb; some derive it from qss, koshesh, and others from qvs, kush;
   while some deduce the verb from the noun qs kosh, which signifies chaff
   or stubble. But however this may be, I consider the real meaning of the
   Prophet to be--Gather yourselves, gather; for this is what grammatical
   construction requires. I do not see why they who read search
   yourselves, depart from the commonly received meaning, except they
   think that the verb gather does not suit the context; but it suits it
   exceedingly well. Others with more refinement read thus--Gather the
   chaff, gather the chaff, as though the Prophet ridiculed the empty
   confidence of the people. But as I have already said, he no doubt shows
   here the remedy, by which they might have anticipated God's judgment,
   with which he had threatened them. He indeed compares them to stubble,
   as we find in the next verse, but he shows that still time is given
   them to repent, so that they might gather themselves, and not be
   dissipated; as though he said--The day of your scattering is at hand;
   ye shall then vanish away like chaff, for ye shall not be able to stand
   at the breath of the Lord's wrath. But now while God withholds himself,
   and does not put forth his hand to destroy you, gather yourselves, that
   ye may not be like the chaff. There are then two parts in this passage;
   the first is, that if the Jews abused, as usual, the forbearance of
   God, they would become like the chaff, for God's wrath would in a
   moment scatter them; but the Prophet in the meantime reminds them that
   a seasonable time for repentance was still given them; for if they
   willingly gathered themselves, God would spare them. Before then the
   day of Jehovah's wrath shall come; gather, he says, yourselves [90]

   But the way of gathering is, when men do not vanish away in their
   foolish confidences, or when they do not indulge their own lusts; for
   whenever men give loose reins to wicked licentiousness, and thus go
   astray in gratifying their corrupt lusts, or when they seek here and
   there vain confidences, they expose themselves to a scattering. Hence
   the Prophet exhorts them to examine themselves, to gather themselves,
   and as it were to draw themselves together, that they might not be like
   the chaff. Hence he says,--gather yourselves, yea, gather, ye nation
   not loved

   Some take the participle nksph, necasaph, in an active sense, as though
   the Prophet had said that the Jews were void of every feeling, and had
   become wholly hardened in their stupidity. But I know not whether this
   can be grammatically allowed. I therefore follow what has been more
   approved. The nation is called not worthy of love, because it did not
   deserve mercy; and God thus amplifies and renders illustrious his own
   grace, because he was still solicitous about the salvation of those who
   had willfully destroyed themselves, and rejected his favor. Though then
   the Jews had by their depravity so alienated themselves from God, that
   there was no reason why he should save them, he yet still continued to
   call them back to himself. It is therefore a remarkable proof of the
   unfailing grace of God, when he shows love to a nation wholly worthy of
   being hated, and is concerned for its safety. [91]

   He then adds, Before the decree brings forth. Here the Prophet asserts
   his own authority, and that of God's other servants: for the Jews
   thought that all threatening would come to nothing, as it is the case
   with most men at this day who deride every true doctrine, as though it
   were nothing but an empty sound. Hence the Prophet ascribes birth to
   his doctrine. It is indeed true, that the word decree has a wider
   meaning; but the Prophet does not speak here of the hidden counsel of
   God. He therefore calls that a decree, which God had already declared
   by his servants: and the meaning is, that it is not beating the air
   when God denounces his vengeance on sinners by his Prophets, but that
   it is a fixed and unchangeable decree, which shall at length be
   effected. But the similitude of birth is most apposite; for as the
   embryo lies hid in the womb, and then emerges in due time into light;
   so God's vengeance, though hid for a time, will yet in due season be
   accomplished, when God sees that men's wickedness is past a remedy. We
   now understand why the Prophet says, that the time was near when the
   decree should bring forth.

   Then he says, Pass away shall the chaff in a day. Some read, Before the
   day comes, when the stubble (or chaff) shall pass away. But I take yvm,
   ium, in another sense, as meaning that the Jews shall quickly pass away
   as the chaff; the like expression we have also met in Hosea. He says
   then that the Jews would perish in a day, in a short time, and as it
   were in a moment; though they thought that they would not be for a long
   time conquered. Pass away, he says, shall they like chaff [92]

   Then he adds, Before it comes, the fury of Jehovah's wrath; the day of
   Jehovah's wrath, gather ye yourselves. He says first, before it comes
   upon you, the fury of wrath, and then, the day of wrath. He repeats the
   same thing; but some of the words are changed, for instead of the fury
   of wrath, he puts in the second clause, the day of wrath; as though he
   had said, that they were greatly deceived if they thought that they
   could escape, because the Lord deferred his vengeance. How so? For the
   day, which was nigh, though not yet arrived, would at length come. As
   when one trusting in the darkness of the night, and thinking himself
   safe from the danger of being taken, is mistaken, for suddenly the sun
   rises and discovers his hiding-place; so the Prophet intimates, that
   though God was now still, it would yet be no advantage to the Jews: for
   he knew the suitable time. Though then he restrained for a time his
   wrath, he yet poured it forth suddenly, when the day came and the
   iniquity of men had become ripe.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [90] The verb, found only in five other places--Exodus 5:7,12; Numbers
   15:32,33; and 1 Kings 17:10,12, means to collect, to gather, and not
   "to search," as said by Kimchi, and adopted by Marckius; nor "to bind,"
   as rendered by Henderson. The import of the passage is considered by
   all to be an invitation to repentance, though the words are differently
   rendered. It is difficult to see the meaning when it is said--"Gather
   yourselves, yea, gather," etc, except such an assembly is meant as is
   recommended by Joel 1:14; the kind of gathering being well understood,
   it is not mentioned. "Gather yourselves," that is, to offer prayers,
   says Grotius. "Be ye assembled-- sunachthete," is the rendering of the
   Septuagint.--Ed.

   [91] [ksph] is found as a verb in four other places, Genesis 31:30; Job
   14:15; Psalm 17:12; and Psalm 84:3. It means to be or to grow pale,
   either through love, as in Genesis and Job, or through hunger, as in
   the first Psalm referred to, or through longing for God's house, as in
   the last, or through shame, as some--such as Grotius, Dathius, and
   Gesenius, suppose to be the case here; and they therefore give this
   rendering--"O nation without shame;" or, "not ashamed." This idea is
   favored by the Septuagint--"unteachable--apaideuton." In no instance is
   it found in a passive sense as to the feeling through which the
   paleness is occasioned, and therefore "worthy of love," or "desired,"
   cannot be its proper rendering. Buxtorf give its meaning in
   Niphal--"desiderio affici--to be touched with or to feel a desire."
   Hence the person spoken of is the subject, not the object, of the
   desire. According, then, to the use of the verb, the rendering here is
   to be--"Ye nation that feels no desire," that is, for God and his law,
   or, "that feels no shame," that is, for its sins. The paraphrase of the
   Targum is--"not willing to be converted to the law," which corresponds
   with the idea which has been stated. Marckius considers that the nation
   is here described as having "no desire," that is for that which was
   good, and that its torpidity and indifference as to religion is what is
   set forth. And such is the view of Cocceius; it had no thirst for
   righteousness, no desire for the kingdom of God--the mark of an
   unregenerated mind.--Ed.

   [92] It is difficult to make the words bear this sense. Hardly a
   sentence has been more variously rendered. The most satisfactory
   solution perhaps is to regard it parenthetic, and to consider "the day"
   as that allowed for repentance: it was to pass away quickly, like the
   chaff carried away by the wind-- As the chaff passing away will be the
   day: Both Marckius and Henderson regard this as the meaning. Then the
   whole verse might be thus translated-- 2. Before the bringing forth of
   the decree,
   (As the chaff passing away will be the day,)
   Before it shall come upon you,
   The burning of Jehovah's anger;
   Before it shall come upon you,
   The day of the anger of Jehovah. Literally it is, "Before it shall not
   come," etc., or, "During the time when it shall not come," etc. [vtrm]
   may be rendered "while;" then the version would be-- While it shall not
   come upon you,
   The burning of Jehovah's anger;
   While it shall not come upon you,
   The day of the anger of Jehovah. There are several MSS. which omit the
   two first lines; but evidently without reason. They are retained in the
   Septuagint. Possibly the second line may refer to the speedy execution
   of "the decree," that its day would pass quickly. Its birth, or its
   bringing forth was its commencement; and the second line may express
   its speedy execution: it would be carried into effect with the
   quickness by which the chaff is carried away by the wind-- As the chaff
   passing away will be its day. The word [vr] is, in either case, a
   participle, and the auxiliary verb is understood, as often is the case
   in Hebrew, and must partake of the tense of the context.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we continue in various ways to provoke thy
   wrath, we may at length be awakened by the blasting of that trumpet
   which sounds in our ears, when thou proclaimest that thou wilt be the
   judge of the world, and testifies also the same so plainly in the
   gospel, so that we may, with our minds raised up to thee, learn to
   renounce all the depraved lusts of the world, and that having shaken
   off our torpidity, we may so hasten to repent, that we may anticipate
   thy judgment, and so find that we are reconciled to thee, as to enjoy
   thy goodness, and ever to retain the taste of it, in order that we may
   be enabled to renounce all the allurements and pleasures of this world,
   until we shall at length come to that blessed rest, where we shall be
   filled with that unspeakable joy, which thou hast promised to us, and
   which we hope for in Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Zephaniah 2:3

   3. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his
   judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid
   in the day of the Lord's anger.

   3. Quaerite Jehovam omnes mansueti terrae, qui judicium ejus fecerunt
   (pro fecistis;) quaerite justitiam, quaerite mansuetudinem, si forte
   abscondamini in die irae Jehovae.


   Here the Prophet turns his discourse to a small number, for he saw that
   he could produce no effect on the promiscuous multitude. For had his
   doctrine been addressed in common to the whole people, there were very
   few who would have attended. We would therefore have been discouraged
   had he not believed that some seed remained among the people, and that
   the office of teaching and exhorting had not been in vain committed to
   him by God. But he shows at the same time that the greater part were
   wholly given up to destruction. We now see why the Prophet especially
   addresses the meek of the land; for few undertook the yoke, though they
   had been already broken down by many calamities. And it hence appears
   that the fruit of correction was not found equal in all, for God had
   chastised the good and the bad, the whole people, from the least to the
   greatest; they had all been laid prostrate by many evils, yet the same
   ferocity remained, as God complains in Isaiah, that he labored in vain
   in punishing that refractory nation. Isaiah 1:5

   But we are here taught that though ministers of the word may think that
   they spend their labor to no purpose, while they sing to the deaf, as
   the proverb is, they ought not yet to depart from the course of their
   vocation; for there will ever be some who will really show, after a
   long time, that they had been divinely and wonderfully saved, so as not
   to perish with others. But what the Prophet had especially in view was
   to show, that the faithful ought not to regard what the multitude may
   do, or how they live; but that when God invites them to repentance, and
   gives them a hope of pardon, they ought without delay to come to him,
   that they might not perish with the rest. And it deserves to be
   noticed, that when God raises his voice, some harden others, and thus
   men lead one another into ruin. Thus it happens that all teaching
   becomes unsuccessful. Hence the Prophet applies a remedy, by showing
   how preposterous it is when some follow others; for in this way they
   increase the ranks of the rebellious; but that if there be any who are
   meek, they ought to be teachable, when God stretches forth his hand and
   shows that he will be propitious, provided they return to the right
   way.

   He calls them meek who had profited under the scourges of God; for the
   Hebrews consider nvym, onuim, to be the afflicted, deriving the word
   from nh, one, to afflict, or to be humble. But as men for the most part
   are not subdued except by scourges, they call, by a metaphor, nvym,
   onuim, the meek, such as have been subdued: for men grow wanton in
   their pleasures, and abundance commonly produces insolence; but by
   adversity they learn to become meek. Hence our Prophet calls those the
   meek of the land who were submissive to God, after having been
   chastised by him. For we know, that though God may smite the wicked,
   they yet continue to have a stiff and iron neck and a brazen front: but
   the faithful are tamed, as Jeremiah confesses as to himself; for he
   says that he was like an untamed heifer before he was chastised by
   God's scourges. So the Prophet directs his discourse to the few who had
   felt the afflicting hand of God, and had been thus humbled. [93]

   He bids them to seek Jehovah, and yet he says that they had wrought his
   judgment. These two clauses seem inconsistent with each other; for if
   they had been previously alienated from God, justly might the Prophet
   bid them to return to the right way; but as they had devoted themselves
   to religion, and formed their life according to the rule of
   uprightness, the Prophet seems to have exhorted them without reason to
   seek God. But the passage is worthy of special notice; for we hence
   learn that even the best are roused by God's scourges to seek true
   religion with greater ardor than they had before done. Though then it
   be our object to serve God and to follow his word, yet when calamities
   arise and God appears as a judge, we ought to be stimulated to greater
   care and diligence; for it never is the case that any one of us fully
   performs his duty. Let us then remember, that we are roused by God
   whenever adversity impends over us, and when God himself shows by
   manifest signs that he is displeased. This is the reason why the
   Prophet bids the pious doers of righteousness to seek God, however much
   they were before devoted to what was just and upright.

   There was also another reason: we know how grievously faith is tried,
   when the good and wicked are indiscriminately and without any
   difference chastised by God's hand; for the godly are then tempted to
   think that it avails them nothing that they have labored sincerely to
   serve God; they think that this has all been in vain and to no purpose,
   for they are brought into the same miseries with others. As then this
   temptation is enough to shake even the strongest, the Prophet here
   exhorts the faithful to persevere, as though he had said, that in the
   first confusion no difference would be found between the good and the
   wicked as to their circumstances, for God would afflict both alike, but
   that the end would be different; and that there was therefore no reason
   for them to despond or to think it of no advantage to seek God: for he
   would at length really show that he approved of their integrity; as
   though he had said, God will not remunerate you at the first moment;
   but your patience will at length find that he is a just judge, who has
   regard for his people, and delivers them in their extremity.

   To do the judgment of God in this place is to form the life according
   to the righteousness of the law. The word mspht, meshepheth, has
   various meanings in Scripture. Sometimes, and indeed often, it
   designates the punishment which God allots to the wicked: but it
   frequently means equity or the rule of right living. Hence to do
   judgment is to observe what is righteous and just, to abstain from what
   is wrong and injurious. But the Prophet calls it the judgment of God,
   because it is what he prescribes in his word and what he approves. For
   we know that men blend various things, by which they would prove
   themselves to be just and righteous: but they deceive themselves,
   except they form their life especially according to what God requires.
   We now perceive what the Prophet means; and he afterwards defines what
   it is to seek God; for the latter part of the verse is added as an
   explanation, that the faithful might understand how God is to be
   sought.

   For hypocrites, as soon as God invites them, accumulate many rites, and
   weary themselves much in things of no value. In short, they think that
   they have sufficiently sought God when they have performed a number of
   ceremonies. But by over-acting they trifle as it were with God, and
   thus deceive themselves. Thus we see repentance profaned. They under
   the Papacy prattle enough about repentance, but when they are asked to
   define it, they begin with contrition; and yet no displeasure at sin is
   mentioned by them, nor any real love of righteousness, but they talk
   about attrition and contrition, and then immediately they leap to
   confession; and this is the principal part of repentance: they
   afterwards come to satisfactions. Thus repentance among the Papists is
   nothing else but a some kind of mistaken solicitude, by which they
   labor to pacify God, as though they came nigh him: nay, the
   satisfactions of the Papacy are nothing else but obstructions between
   God and men.

   This evil has been common in all ages. The Prophet, therefore, does not
   without reason define what the true and rightful way of seeking God is,
   and that is, when righteousness is sought, when humility is sought. By
   righteousness he understands the same thing as by judgment; as though
   he had said, Advance in a righteous and holy course of life, for God
   will not forget your obedience, provided your hearts grow not faint,
   and ye persevere to the end. We hence see that God complains, not only
   when we obtrude external pomps and devices I know not what, as though
   he might like a child be amused by us; but also when we do not
   sincerely devote our life to his service. And he adds humility to
   righteousness; for it is difficult even for the very best of men not to
   murmur against God when he severely chastises them. We indeed find how
   much their own delicacy embitters the minds of men when God appears
   somewhat severe with them. Hence the Prophet, in order to check all
   clamors, exhorts the faithful here to cultivate humility, so that they
   might patiently bear the rigor by which God would try them, and might
   suffer themselves to be ruled by his hand. Peter had the same thing in
   view when he said, Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God. (1
   Peter 5:6.) We now then see why the Prophet requires from the faithful
   not only righteousness but also humility; it was, that they might with
   composed minds wait for the deliverance which God had promised. They
   were not in the interval to murmur, nor to give vent to their own
   perverse feelings, however severely God might treat them.

   We may hence gather a profitable instruction: The Prophet does not
   address here men who were depraved and had wholly neglected what was
   just and right, but he directs his discourse to the best, the most
   upright, the most holy: and yet he shows that they had no other remedy,
   but humbly and patiently to bear the chastisement of God. It then
   follows that no perfection can be found among men, such as can meet the
   judgment of God. For were any to object and say, that they devoted
   themselves to righteousness, there is yet a just reason why they should
   humble themselves; for we are all guilty before God, and no one can
   clear himself, inasmuch as when any one examines his own conscience, he
   finds that he is not free from sin. However conscious then we may be of
   acting uprightly, and God himself may be a judge to us, and the Holy
   Spirit the witness of our true and real integrity; yet when the Lord
   summons us before his tribunal, let us all, from the least to the
   greatest, learn to confess ourselves guilty and exposed to judgment.

   He afterwards adds, If it may be (or, it may be) ye shall be concealed
   [94] in the day of Jehovah's anger. The Prophet speaks not doubtingly,
   as though the faithful were uncertain as to God's favor: but he had
   another thing in view,--that though no hope remained as to the
   perceptions of men, yet the faithful would not lose their labor, if
   they sought God; for in their worst circumstances they would find him
   propitious to them and their safety secured by his kindness. Hence we
   see, that the Prophet in these words points out the disastrous
   character of the event, but no deficiency in the love of God. Though
   the Lord is ready to pardon, nay, of his own self anticipates his
   people, and kindly invites them to himself; it is yet necessary for
   them to consider how wonderful is his power in preserving his elect,
   when all things seem desperate. It may then be, he says, when the Jews
   understood that all things were in a state of extreme despair: and the
   Prophet said this, partly that the reprobate and the perverse might
   know that they were to perish, and partly that the faithful might
   appreciate the more the favor of God, when they saw themselves
   delivered from death by a miracle, and found that it would be a kind of
   resurrection, when God became their deliverer. Hence the Prophet, in
   order to commend to God's children his salvation, which he offers them,
   and to render more illustrious God's favor, makes use of the particle
   'vly, auli, it may be. In the meantime he fulminates, as I have already
   said, against the reprobate, that they might understand that it was all
   over with them. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [93] Newcome renders the adjective "lowly," and the noun "lowliness;"
   but Marckius and Henderson render the first "humble," as the Septuagint
   do--tapeinoi, and the second "humility." They were those who had been
   made humble by affliction. The design of affliction is to make us
   humble, submissive to God's will; and this is the effect of sanctified
   affliction. It is somewhat singular that the verb means to afflict and
   to be humble, as though affliction were needful to render us humble.
   The word [nvt], occurs in 2 Samuel 22:36, and Psalm 18:35, and is
   rendered "gentleness" in our common version, but more correctly in our
   Prayer-book version "loving correction." Perhaps the best rendering
   would be "humbling affliction;" and the idea of humbling affliction
   making great is very striking. The word used by the Septuagint is
   paideia--discipline; and the Vulgate is the same.--Ed.

   [94] The idea is not "protected," as given by Newcome, but "secreted"
   or concealed as in a hiding-place. "Hid" is the version of Henderson,
   and also of Marckius.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 2:4, 5

   4. For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall
   drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.

   4. Quia Aza derelicta erit, et Aksalon in vastiationem; Asdod in
   meridie expellent, et Ekron dissipabitur.

   5. Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the
   Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of
   the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no
   inhabitant.

   5. Heus habitatores funiculi maris (vel, regionis) gens Cretim; sermo
   Iehovae contra vos Canaan, terra Philistim; et exterminabo te, ne sit
   habitator.


   The Prophet begins here to console the elect; for when God's vengeance
   had passed away, which would only be for a time against them, the
   heathens and foreigners would find God in their turn to be their judge
   to punish them for the wrongs done to his people; though some think
   that God's judgment on the Jews is here described, while yet the
   Prophet expressly mentions their neighbors: but the former view seems
   to me more suitable,--that the Prophet reminds the faithful of a future
   change of things, for God would not perpetually afflict his chosen
   people, but would transfer his vengeance to other nations. The meaning
   then is--that God, who has hitherto threatened the Jews, would
   nevertheless be propitious to them, not indeed to all the people, for a
   great part was doomed to destruction, but to the remnant, whom the Lord
   had chosen as a seed to himself, that there might be some church
   remaining. For we know, that God had always so moderated the punishment
   he inflicted on his people, as not to render void his covenant, nor
   abolish the memory of Abraham's race: for this reason he was to come
   forth as their Redeemer.

   Since then the Prophet speaks here against Gaza, and Ashkelon, and
   Ashdod, and Akron, and the Philistine, and the Cretians and others, he
   intended no doubt to add courage to the faithful, that they might not
   despair of God's mercy, though they might find themselves very
   grievously oppressed; for he could at length put an end to his wrath,
   after having purged his Church of its dregs. And this admonition the
   faithful also need, that they may not envy the wicked and the despisers
   of God, as though their condition were better or more desirable. For
   when the Lord spares the wicked and chastens us, we are tempted to
   think that nothing is better than to shake off every yoke. Lest then
   this temptation should have assailed the faithful, the Prophet reminded
   them in time, that there was no reason why the heathens should flatter
   or congratulate themselves, when God did not immediately punish them;
   for their portion was prepared for them.

   He mentions Gaza first, a name which often occurs in scripture. The
   Hebrews called it Aza; but as , oin, is the first letter, the Greeks
   have rendered it Gaza, and heathen authors have thought it to be a
   Persia word, and it means in that language a treasure. But this is a
   vain notion, for it is no doubt a Hebrew word. He then adds Ashkelon, a
   city nigh to Gaza. In the third place he mentions Ashdod, which the
   Greeks have translated Azotus, and the Latins have followed the Greeks.
   He names Ekron in the last place. All these cities were near to the
   Jews, and were not far from one another towards the Moabites and the
   Idumeans. [95]

   He then adds, Ho! (or, woe to, hv) the inhabitants of the line of the
   sea. The region of the sea he calls Galilee; and he joins the
   Kerethites and the Philistine. Some think that he alludes to the
   troops, who carried on war under David; for he had chosen his garrison
   soldiers from that nation, that is, from the people of Galilee, and had
   called them Kerethites and Philistine. But I know not whether the
   Prophet spoke so refinedly. I rather think, that he refers here to
   those heathen nations, which had been hostile to the Jews, though
   vicinity ought to have been a bond of kindness. Hence he includes them
   all in the name of Canaan: for I do not take it here, as some do, as
   signifying merchants; for the Prophet evidently means, that however
   called, they were all Canaanites, who had been long ago doomed to
   destruction. Since then those regions had been enemies to the Jews, the
   Prophet intimates that God would become the defender of his chosen
   people.

   The word of Jehovah is against you. God, who has hitherto threatened
   his own people, summons you to judgment. Think not that you will escape
   unpunished for having vexed his Church. For though God designed to
   prove the patience of his people, yet neither the Moabites, nor the
   rest, were excusable when they cruelly oppressed the Jews; yea, when
   they purposed through them to fight with God himself, the creator of
   heaven and earth. He afterwards adds, There shall be no inhabitant, for
   God would destroy them all. We now see that the Prophet had no other
   design but to alleviate the bitter grief of the faithful by this
   consolation,--that their miseries would be only for a time, and that
   God would ere long punish their enemies. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [95] This verse, literally rendered, retains more of its poetic
   character,-- 4. For Gaza, forsaken shall she be,
   And Ashkelon shall be a desolation;
   Ashdod, at mid-day shall they drive it out,
   And Ekron shall be rooted up. In the first and the last line there is a
   correspondence in the sound of the words. The following presents
   another instance of the nominative case absolute,-- 5. Woe to the
   dwellers of the line of the sea,
   The nation of the Kerethites!
   The word of Jehovah is against you:
   Canaan, the land of the Philistines,
   I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant. The line
   of the sea, meaning the coast along the shore, is so called, says
   Henderson, "from the custom of using a cord or line in measuring off or
   dividing a territory." Some derive "Kerethites" from [krt], to cut off,
   to destroy; and so they were cutters off or destroyers. They were
   celebrated men of war in the time of David, 2 Samuel 8:18.
   "Philistines" mean emigrants, says Henderson; the word being derived
   from a verb, which signifies, in the Ethiopic language, to rove, to
   migrate.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 2:6, 7

   6. And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and
   folds for flocks.

   6. Et erit funiculus maris (id est, regio; sed metaphorice Hebraei
   vocant regionem, funiculum, propter distributionem) habitaculum caulis
   pastorum et septa ovium.

   7. And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they
   shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in
   the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away
   their captivity.

   7. Et erit regio reliquiis domus Jehudah, apud eos pascentur, in
   domibus Ascalon vesperi accubabunt; quia visitabit Jehova Deus ipsorum
   ipsos, et reducet captivitatem eorum.


   The Prophet confirms what he has before said respecting the future
   vengeance of God, which was now nigh at hand to the Moabites and other
   neighboring nations, who had been continually harassing the miserable
   Jews. Hence, he says, that that whole region would become the
   habitation of sheep. It is a well known event, that when any country is
   without inhabitants shepherds occupy it; for there is no sowing nor
   reaping there, but grass alone grows. Where, therefore, there is no
   cultivation, where no number of men are found, there shepherds find a
   place for their flocks, there they build sheep cots. It is, therefore,
   the same as though the Prophet had said, that the country would be
   desolate, as we find it expressed in the next verse. [96]

   He immediately adds, but for a different reason, that the coast of the
   sea would be a habitation to the house of Judah. And there is here a
   striking divergence from the flocks of shepherds to the tribe of Judah,
   which was as it were, the chosen flock of God. The Prophet then, after
   having said that the region would be waste and desolate, immediately
   adds, that it would be for the benefit of the chosen people; for the
   Lord would grant there to the Jews a safe and secure rest. But the
   Prophet confines this to the remnant; for the greater part, as we have
   already seen, were become so irreclaimable, that the gate of mercy was
   completely closed against them. The Prophet, at the same time, by
   mentioning a remnant, shows that there would always be some seed from
   which God would raise up a new Church; and he also encourages the
   faithful to entertain hope, so that their own small number might not
   terrify them; for when they considered themselves and found themselves
   surpassed by a vast multitude, they might have thought that they were
   of no account. Lest then they should be disheartened the Prophet says
   that this remnant would be the object of God's care; for when he would
   visit the whole coast of the sea and other regions, he would provide
   there for the Jews a safe habitation and refuge.

   That line then, he says, shall be for the residue of the house of
   Judah; feed shall they in Ashkelon, and there shall they lie down in
   the evening; that is, they shall find in their exile some
   resting-place; for we know that the Jews were not all removed to
   distant lands; and they who may have been hid in neighboring places
   were afterwards more easily gathered, when a liberty to return was
   permitted them. This is what the Prophet means now, when he says, that
   there would be a refuge in the night to the Jews among the Moabites and
   other neighboring nations.

   A reason follows, which confirms what I have stated, for Jehovah their
   God, he says, will visit them. We hence see that the Prophet mitigates
   here the sorrow of exile and of that most grievous calamity which was
   nigh the Jews, by promising to them a new visitation of God; as though
   he had said, Though the Lord seems now to rage against you, and seems
   to forget his own covenant, yet he will again remember his mercy, when
   the suitable time shall come. And he adds, he will restore their
   captivity; and he added this, that he might show that his favor would
   prove victorious against all hindrances. The Jews might indeed have
   raised this objection, Why does not the Lord help us immediately; but
   he, on the contrary, allows our enemies to remove us into exile? The
   Prophet here calls upon them to exercise patience; and yet he promises,
   that after having been driven into exile, they should again return to
   their country; for the Lord would not suffer that exile to be
   perpetual. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [96] The words, [nvt krt rym], are rendered by Calvin, "habitaculum
   caulis pastorum--an habitation (or a dwelling) for the sheepcots of
   shepherds." The Targum takes the two first words in the singular
   number; the second is evidently so, and the first may be so also: and
   [krt] certainly does not mean sheepcots, but digging, from [krh], to
   dig. The reference is either to the pits dug for watering the flock, as
   Piscator thinks, or to the subterraneous huts, or caves, dug for the
   purpose of shelter, as Drusius and Bochart suppose. Junius and
   Tremelius render the words, "sheepcots, the delvings of shepherds;" and
   Drusius, "dwellings of the digging out of shepherds," i.e., dwellings
   dug out by shepherds. The most literal and the easiest construction is,
   "dwellings, the digging of shepherds." Then the verse might be thus
   rendered,-- And the line of the sea shall be dwellings,
   Dug out by shepherds, and folds for sheep. Parkhurst quotes Harmer, who
   says, "the Eastern shepherds make use of caves very frequently,
   sleeping in them and driving their flocks into them at night. The
   mountains bordering on the Syrian coast are remarkable for the number
   of caves, and are found particularly in the neighborhood of Ashkelon."
   How fully then was this prophecy fulfilled.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 2:8

   8. I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children
   of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified
   themselves against their border.

   8. Audivi opprobrium Moab, et contumelias filiorum Ammon, quibus
   exprobrarunt populo meo, et se extulerunt contra terminum ipsorum.


   The Prophet confirms what I have just said of God's vengeance against
   foreign enemies. Though all the neighboring nations had been eager in
   their hostility to the Jews, yet we know that more hatred, yea and more
   fury, had been exhibited by these two nations than by any other, that
   is, by the Moabites and the Ammonites, notwithstanding their connection
   with them by blood, for they derived their origin from Lot, who was
   Abraham's nephew. Though, then, that connection ought to have turned
   the Moabites and the Ammonites to mercy, we yet know they always
   infested the Jews with greater fury than others, and as it were with
   savage cruelty. This is the reason why the Prophet speaks now
   especially of them. Some indeed take this sentence as spoken by the
   faithful; but the context requires it to be ascribed to God, and no
   doubt he reminds them that he looked down from on high on the proud
   vauntings of Moab which he scattered in the air, as though he had
   declared that it was not hidden or unknown to him how cruelly the
   Moabites and Ammonites raged against the Jews, how proud and inhuman
   they had been. And this was a very seasonable consolation. For the Jews
   might have been swallowed up with despair, had not this promise been
   made to them. They saw the Moabites and the Ammonites burning with
   fury, when yet they had not been injured or provoked. They also saw
   that they made gain and derived advantage from the calamities of a
   miserable people. What could the faithful think? These wicked men not
   only harassed them with impunity, but their cruelty and perfidy towards
   them was gainful. Where was God now? If he regarded his own Church,
   would he not have interposed? Lest then a temptation of this kind
   should upset the faithful, the Prophet introduces God here as the
   speaker,--

   I have heard, he says, the reproach of Moab; I have heard the revilings
   of Amman: "Nothing escapes me; though I do not immediately show that
   these things are regarded by me, yet I know and observe how shamefully
   the Moabites and the Ammonites have persecuted you: they at length
   shall find that I am the guardian of your safety, and that you are
   under my protection." We now apprehend the Prophet's design. Nearly the
   same words are used by Isaiah, Isaiah 16:1, and also by Jeremiah
   Jeremiah 48:1, they both pursue the subject much farther, while our
   Prophet only touches on it briefly, for we see that what he says is
   comprised in very few words. But by saying that the reproach of Moab
   and the revilings of the children of Amman had come into remembrance
   before God, what he had in view was--that the Jews might be assured and
   fully persuaded that they were not rejected and forsaken, though for a
   time they were reproachfully treated by the wicked. The Prophet indeed
   takes the words reproach and revilings, in an active sense. [97]

   He then adds, By which they have upbraided many people. God intimates
   here that he does not depart from his elect when the wicked spit, as it
   were, in their faces. There is indeed nothing which so much wounds the
   feelings of ingenuous minds as reproach; there is not so much
   bitterness in a hundred deaths as in one reproach, especially when the
   wicked licentiously triumph, and do this with the applauding consent of
   the whole world; for then all difference between good and evil is
   confounded, and good conscience is as it were buried. But the Prophet
   shows here, that the people of God suffer no loss when they are thus
   unworthily harassed by the wicked and exposed to their reproach.

   He at last subjoins that they had enlarged over their border. Some
   consider mouth to be understood--they have enlarged the mouth against
   their border; and the word, it is true, without any addition, is often
   taken in this sense; but in this place the construction is fuller, for
   the words l-gvvlm, ol-gebulam, over their border, follow the verb. The
   Prophet means that God's wrath had been provoked by the petulance of
   both nations, for they wished to break up, as it were, the borders,
   which had been fixed by God. The land of Canaan, we know, had been
   given to the Jews by an hereditary right;--When the Most High, says
   Moses, divided the nations, he set a line for Jacob. Deuteronomy 32:8.
   It is indeed true that the possessions of the nations were allotted to
   them by the hidden counsel of God; but there was a special reason as to
   his chosen people; for the Lord had made Abraham the true possessor of
   that land, even for ever. Genesis 17:8. Now the Moabites were confined,
   as it were, to a certain place; the Lord had assigned to them their own
   inheritance. When, therefore, they sought to go beyond and to invade
   the land of the Jews, God's wrath must have been kindled against them;
   for they thus fought, not against mortals, but against God himself; for
   by removing the borders fixed by him, they attempted to subvert his
   eternal decree. We now then understand why the Prophet says that the
   children of Moab and of Ammon had enlarged over the border of those who
   had been placed in the land of Canaan by God's hand; for they not only
   sought to eject their neighbors, but wished and tried to take away from
   God's hand that inheritance which the Lord had given to Abraham, and
   given, as I have said, in perpetuity. [98]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [97] That is, the reproach cast by Moab, and the revilings uttered by
   Ammon.--Ed.

   [98] There is a difference as to the meaning of the last line. Newcome
   adopts our common version,-- And magnified themselves against their
   border Henderson's rendering is essentially the same-- And carried
   themselves haughtily against their border. The verb [ndl] is transitive
   and intransitive in Kal--to make great and to be great; it seems to
   partake of a similar character in Hiphil, as it is found here, to
   magnify, and to grow great or proud, and hence to exult or to triumph;
   and when followed by [l], as here, to exult over a person or a
   country,--see Job 19:5; Psalm 35:26; 38:17; Ezekiel 35:13. In these
   verses "to exult over" would be the best rendering; as also in the 10th
   verse of this chapter. The idea of enlarging or extending over, as
   adopted by Jerome and Dathius, as well as by Calvin, is not
   countenanced by any other passage. The best rendering here is-- And
   exulted over their border. This line corresponds with the revilings of
   Ammon, as the preceding does with the reproach of Moab. That it was the
   triumphant and exulting language of Ammon is evident, because it was
   what was heard--"I have heard," etc. The particle ['sr], rendered here
   "quibus--by which," and "wherewith" by Newcome, is rendered "who" by
   Marckius and Henderson--"who have reproached on my people;" and this is
   the most natural construction. Some have rendered it "because."--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast been pleased to consecrate us a
   peculiar people to thyself, we may be mindful of such an invaluable
   favor, and devote ourselves woody to thee, and so labor to cultivate
   true sincerity as to bear the marks of thy people and of thy holy
   Church: and as we are so polluted by so many of the defilements of our
   own flesh and of this world, grant that thy Holy Spirit may cleanse us
   more and more every day, until thou bringest us at length to that
   perfection to which thou invites us by the voice of thy gospel, that we
   may also enjoy that blessed glory which has been provided for us by the
   blood of thy only begotten Son. Amen.

   Zephaniah 2:9, 10

   9. Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
   Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah,
   even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation:
   the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people
   shall possess them.

   9. Propterea vivo ego, dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus Israel, quod Moab
   sicuti Sodoma erit, et filii Ammon sicuti Gomorrha, productio urticae
   et fodina salis, et vastitas in perpetuum: reliquiae populi mei
   diripient eos, et residuum gentis meae possidebit eos.

   10. This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached
   and magnified themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts.

   10. Hoc illis pro superbis sua, quia exprobrarunt et insultarunt super
   populum Jehovae exercituum.


   In order to cheer the miserable Jews by some consolation, God said, in
   what we considered yesterday, that the wantonness of Moab was known to
   him; he now adds, that he would visit with punishment the reproaches
   which had been mentioned. For it would have availed them but little
   that their wrongs had been observed by God, if no punishment had been
   prepared. Hence the Prophet reminds them that God is no idle spectator,
   who only observes what takes place in the world; but that there is a
   reward laid up for all the ungodly. And these verses are to be taken in
   connection, that the faithful may know that their wrongs are not
   unknown to God, and also that he will be their defender. But that the
   Jews might have a more sure confidence that God would be their
   deliverer, he interposes an oath. God at the same time shows that he is
   really touched when he sees his people so cruelly and immoderately
   harassed, when the ungodly seem to think that an unbridled license is
   permitted them. God therefore shows here, that not only the salvation
   of his people is an object of his care, but that he undertakes their
   cause as though his anger was kindled; not that passions belong to him
   but such a form of speaking is adopted in order to express what the
   faithful could never otherwise conceive an idea of, that is, to express
   the unspeakable love of God towards them, and his care for them.

   He then says that he lives, as though he had sworn by his own life. As
   we have elsewhere seen that he swears by his life, so he speaks now.
   Live do I, that is, As I am God, so will I avenge these wrongs by which
   my people are now oppressed. And for the same reason he calls himself
   Jehovah of hosts, and the God of Israel. In the first clause he exalts
   his own power, that the Jews might know that he was endued with power;
   and then he mentions his goodness, because he had adopted them as his
   people. The meaning then is that God swears by his own life; and that
   the Jews might not think that this was done in vain, his power is
   brought before them, and then his favor is added.

   Moab, he says, shall be like Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like
   Gomorrah, even for the production of the nettle and for a mire of salt;
   [99] that is, their lands should be reduced to a waste, or should
   become wholly barren, so that nothing was to grow there but nettles, as
   the case is with desert places. As to the expression, the mine (fodina)
   or quarry of salt, it often occurs in scripture: a salt-pit denotes
   sterility in Hebrew. And the Prophet adds, that this would not be for a
   short time only; It shall be (he says) a perpetual desolation. He also
   adds, that this would be for the advantage of the Church; for the
   residue of my people shall plunder them, and the remainder of my nation
   shall possess them. He ever speaks of the residue; for as it was said
   yesterday, it was necessary for that people to be cleansed from their
   dregs, so that a small portion only would remain; and we know that not
   many of them returned from exile.

   The import of the whole is, that though God determined to diminish his
   Church, so that a few only survived, yet these few would be the heirs
   of the whole land, and possess the kingdom, when God had taken
   vengeance on all their enemies.

   It hence follows, according to the Prophet, that this shall be to them
   for their pride. We see that the Prophet's object is, to take away
   whatever bitterness the Jews might feel when insolently slandered by
   their enemies. As then there was danger of desponding, since nothing,
   as it was said yesterday, is more grievous to be borne than reproach,
   God does here expressly declare, that the proud triumph of their
   neighbors over the Jews would be their own ruin; for, as Solomon says,
   Pride goes before destruction.' Proverbs 16:18. And he again confirms
   what he had already referred to--that the Jews would not be wronged
   with impunity, for God had taken them under his guardianship, and was
   their protector: Because they have reproached, he says, and triumphed
   over the people of Jehovah of hosts. He might have said, over my
   people, as in the last verse; but there is something implied in these
   words, as though the Prophet had said, that they carried on war not
   with mortals but with God himself, whose majesty was insulted, when the
   Jews were so unjustly oppressed. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [99] This clause is rendered differently by some. The word [mmsq]
   occurs only here. It is rendered by the Targum by a word which means a
   "deserted place," and so Newcome renders it, "A deserted place for the
   thorn:" so also do Drusius, Grotius, Piscator, and Marckius. The
   Septuagint have mistaken the word for "Damascus," and give a version of
   the whole clause wholly foreign to the context. Henderson thinks that
   the word has the same meaning with [msk], to draw out, to extend, and
   gives this version, "A region of overrunning brambles." This is
   far-fetched. The word, [chrvl], rendered "nettle" by Calvin, Grotius,
   and others, cannot be so taken, according to Drusius and Bochart, for
   in Job 30:7, men are said to gather under it. It is found besides only
   in Proverbs 24:31. It may be rendered either a thorn or a bramble. The
   other part of the sentence is literally "a digging place for salt."
   Moab was to be like Sodom, and Ammon like Gommorah, not as to the
   manner of their ruin, but as to the extent of it. It was to be an
   entire overthrow. Their habitation was not to become a pool of water
   like Sodom and Gommorah, but a place where the bramble was to grow, and
   salt might be dug. And it was to be "a desolation," [d-vlm], "for
   ages;" for the word means an indefinite time. So Drusius regards it
   here as meaning a long time. But some consider the "desolation," as
   having reference to the people and not to the place. If so, the
   rendering were wholly obliterated. Moab and Ammon, as a separate
   people, are altogether extinct. The whole verse is as follows-- 9.
   Therefore, as I live,
   Saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel,
   Surely Moab like Sodom shall be,
   And the children of Ammon like Gomorrah,
   The desert of the thorn and the excavation of salt,
   Yea, a desolation for ages;
   The remnant of my people shall plunder them,
   And the residue of my nation shall possess them. The two last lines
   refer to the children of Ammon, as the two preceding especially to
   Moab. The country of Moab was on the eastern side of the Dead Sea, and
   that of Ammon was north-east, of Moab. Both were subdued and led
   captive by Nebuchadnezzar about four or six years after the captivity
   of Judah. They were afterwards partially restored, especially the
   children of Ammon, as Tobiah was their chief in the time of Nehemiah.
   Nehemiah 4:3. They were "plundered," as recorded in 1 Maccabees
   5:35,51, by Judas Maccabeus. Of Moab we read nothing at that time: but
   it appears, that for ages it has been desolate. "Not one," says
   Burckhart, the traveler, "of the ancient cities of Moab exists as
   tenanted by man," and he speaks of "their entire desolation." Another
   modern traveler, Seetzen, a Russian, speaking of Ammon, says, "All this
   country, formerly so populous, is now changed into a vast desert."--Ed.

   Zephaniah 2:11

   11. The Lord will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the
   gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place,
   even all the isles of the heathen.

   11. Terribilis Iehova super eos, quia consumpsit omnes deos terrae: et
   adorabit eum quisque ex loco suo, omnes insulae gentium.


   He proceeds with the same subject,--that God would show his power in
   aiding his people. But he calls him a terrible God, who had for a time
   patiently endured the wantonness of his enemies, and thus became
   despised by them: for the ungodly, we know, never submit to God unless
   they are constrained by his hand; and then they are not bent so as
   willingly to submit to his authority; but when forced they are silent.
   [100] This is what the Prophet means in these words; as though he had
   said, that the wicked now mock God, as they disregard his power, but
   that they shall find how terrible an avenger of his people he is, so
   that they would have to dread him. And then he compares the
   superstitions of the nations with true religion; as though he had said,
   that this would be to the Jews as a reward for their piety, inasmuch as
   they worshipped the only true God, and that all idols would be of no
   avail against the help of God. And this was a necessary admonition; for
   the ungodly seemed to triumph for a time, not only over a conquered
   people, but over God himself, and thus gloried in their superstitious
   and vain inventions. The Prophet, therefore, confirms their desponding
   minds; for God, he says, will at length consume all the gods of the
   nations

   The verb rzh, reze, means strictly to make lean or to famish, but is to
   be taken here metaphorically, as signifying to consume. God then will
   famish all the inventions of the nations: and he alludes to that famine
   which idols had occasioned through the whole world; as though he had
   said, that God's glory would shortly appear, which would exterminate
   whatever glory the false gods had obtained among them, so that it would
   melt away like fatness.

   He at last adds, that the remotest nations would become suppliants to
   God; for by saying, adore him shall each from his place, [101] he
   doubtless means, that however far off the countries might be, the
   distance would be no hindrance to God's name being celebrated, when his
   power became known to remote lands. And, for the same reason, he
   mentions the islands of the nations, that is, countries beyond the sea:
   for the Hebrews, as it has been elsewhere observed, call those
   countries islands which are far distant, and divided by the sea. [102]
   In short, the Prophet shows, that the redemption of the people would be
   so wonderful, that the fame of it would reach the farthest bounds of
   the earth, and constrain foreign nations to give glory to the true God,
   and that it would dissipate all the mists of superstition, so that
   idols would be exposed to scorn and contempt. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [100] The word, [nvr'], is rendered "to be feared," by Cocceius and
   Henderson, and [lyhm], "above them," that is, "the gods of the earth,"
   mentioned in the next line; it being considered an instance of a
   pronoun preceding its noun. But this is forced; and it is not
   necessary. Moab and Ammon are evidently referred to; and what is said
   is, that God would be terrible to them, as well as to others, for he
   would famish or destroy all the gods of the earth. And then in the next
   verse he mentions other nations. Some extend what is here said to
   gospel-times; but there seems no reason for this, inasmuch as God's
   judgment is the subject of the Prophet.--Ed.

   [101] Literally-- And bow down to him, every one from his place,
   Shall all the islands of the nations.

   [102] By the earth the Jews understood the great continent of all Asia
   and Africa, to which they had acces by land; and by the isles of the
   sea they understood the places to which they sailed by sea,
   particularly all Europe. Sir I. Newton on Daniel, p. 276."--Newcome.

   Zephaniah 2:12

   12. Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.

   12. Etiam vos Ethiopes, interfecti gladio meo ipsi (alii vertunt, cum
   ipsis.)


   The Prophet extends farther the threatened vengeance, and says, that
   God would also render to the Ethiopians the reward which they deserved;
   for they had also harassed the chosen people. But if God punished that
   nation, how could Ammon and Moab hope to escape? For how could God
   spare so great a cruelty, since he would visit with punishment the
   remotest nations? For the hatred of the Moabites and of the Ammonites,
   as we have said, was less excusable, because they were related to the
   children of Abraham. They ought, on this account, to have mitigated
   their fierceness: besides, vicinity ought to have rendered them more
   humane. But as they exceeded other nations in cruelty, a heavier
   punishment awaited them. Now this comparison was intended for this
   end--that the Jews might know that God would be inexorable towards the
   Moabites, by whom they had been so unjustly harassed, since even the
   Ethiopians would be punished, who yet were more excusable on account of
   their distance.

   As to the words, some regard the demonstrative pronoun hmh, eme, they,
   as referring to the Babylonians, and others, to the Moabites. I prefer
   to understand it of the Moabites, if we read, like them, or with them,
   as these interpreters consider it: for they regard the particle 't, at,
   with, or k, caph, like, to be understood, Ye Ethiopians shall be slain
   by my sword like them, or with them. It would in this case doubtless
   apply to the Moabites. But it seems to me that the sentence is
   irregular, even ye Ethiopians, and then, they shall be slain by any
   sword. The Prophet begins the verse in the second person, summoning the
   Ethiopians to appear before God's tribunal; he afterwards adds in the
   third person, they shall be slain by my sword. [103]

   God calls whatever evils were impending over the Ethiopians his sword;
   for though they were destroyed by the Chaldeans yet it was done under
   the guidance of God himself. The Chaldeans made war under his
   authority, as the Assyrians did, who had been previously employed by
   him to execute his vengeance. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [103] Newcome cuts the knot, here by an emendation, by ['tm], ye, for
   [hmh], they; and Houbigant, by [thyv], ye shall be,--"the wounded of my
   sword shall ye be." This is according to the Septuagint; but the former
   is more in accordance with the Hebrew idiom; for the pronoun is often
   used without the auxiliary verb. Some take [hmh] as ipsi in Latin,
   connected with vos, ye yourselves. Then the rendering would be-- Also
   ye Cushites,
   The slain of my sword shall ye yourselves be. But what Calvin says is
   not uncommon in the Prophet, the abrupt change of persons.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 2:13

   13. And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy
   Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness.

   13. Et extendet manum suam ad Aquilomen, et perdet Assyriam, et ponet
   Ninevem in vastitatiem, desolationem instar deserti.


   The Prophet proceeds here to the Assyrians, whom we know to have been
   special enemies to the Church of God. For the Moabites and the
   Ammonites were fans only, as we have elsewhere seen, as they could not
   do much harm by their own strength. Hence they stirred up the
   Assyrians, they stirred up the Ethiopians and remote nations. The
   meaning, then, is, that no one of all the enemies of the Church would
   be left unpunished by God, as every one would receive a reward for his
   cruelty. He speaks now of God in the third person; but in the last
   verse God himself said, that the Ethiopians would be slain by his
   sword. The Prophet adds here, He will extend his hand to the north;
   that is, God will not complete his judgments on the Ethiopians; but he
   will go farther, even to Nineveh and to all the Assyrians.

   Nineveh, we know, was the metropolis of the empire, before the
   Assyrians were conquered by the Babylonians. Thus Babylon then
   recovered the sovereignty which it had lost; and Nineveh, though not
   wholly demolished, was yet deprived of its ruling power, and gradually
   lost its name and its wealth, until it was reduced into a waste; for
   the building of Ctesiphon, as we have elsewhere seen, proved its ruin.
   But the Prophet, no doubt, proceeds here to administer comfort to the
   Jews, lest they should despair, while the Lord did not interfere. And
   the extension of the hand means as though he said, that his own time is
   known to the Lord, and that he would put forth his power when needful.
   Assyria was north as to Judea: hence he says, to the north will the
   Lord extend his hand, and will destroy Assyria; he will make Nineveh a
   desolation, that it may be like the desert. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 2:14

   14. And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of
   the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the
   upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation
   shall be in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.

   14. Et cubabunt in medio ejus greges, omnes bestiae gentium: etiam
   onocrotalus, etiam noctua (alii vertunt, pro onocrotalo, ibin, alii,
   cuculum; alii, pro noctua, ericium) in postibus ejus pernoctabunt; vox
   cantabit in fenestra, in poste vastitatis (alii vertunt, corvum; sed
   nomen vastitatis, quod postulat ratio grammaticae, retinendum nobis
   est,) quia nudavit cedrum (vel, contignationem.)


   The Prophet describes here the state of the city and the desolation of
   the country. He says, that the habitations of flocks would be in the
   midst of the city Nineveh. The city, we know, was populous; but while
   men were so many, there was no place for flocks, especially in the
   middle of a city so celebrated. Hence no common change is here
   described by the Prophet, when he says, that flocks would lie down in
   the middle of Nineveh; and he adds, all wild beasts. For beasts, which
   seek seclusion and shun the sight of men, are wont to come forth, when
   they find a country desolate and deserted; and they range then at
   large, as it is the case after a slaughter in war; and when any region
   is emptied of its inhabitants, the wolves, the lions, and other wild
   beasts, roam here and there at full liberty. So the Prophet says, that
   wild beasts would come from other parts and remote places, and find a
   place where Nineveh once stood. [104] He adds that the bitterns, or the
   storks or the cuckoos, and similar wild birds would be there. [105] As
   to their various kinds, I make no laborious research; for it is enough
   to know the Prophet's design: besides, the Jews themselves, who boldly
   affirm that either the bittern or the stork is meant, yet adduce
   nothing that is certain. What, in short, this description means,
   is--that the place, which before a vast multitude of men inhabited,
   would become so forsaken, that wild beasts and nocturnal birds would be
   its only inhabitants.

   But we must bear in mind what I have stated, that all these things were
   set before the Jews, that they might patiently bear their miseries,
   understanding that God would become their defender. For this is the
   only support that remains for us under very grievous evils, as Paul
   reminds us in the first chapter of the Second Epistle to the
   Thessalonians; for he says, that the time will come when the Lord shall
   give to us relief and refreshment, and that he will visit our
   adversaries with punishment 2 Thessalonians 1:6.

   The Prophet mentions especially Nineveh, that the Jews might know that
   there is nothing so great and splendid in the world which God does not
   esteem of less consequence than the salvation of his Church, as it is
   said in Isaiah, I will give Egypt as thy ransom. So God threatens the
   wealthiest city, that he might show how much he loved his chosen
   people. And the Jews could not have attributed this to their own
   worthiness; but the cause of so great a love depended on their
   gratuitous adoption. It afterwards follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [104] It is literally, "every wild beast of the nation,"--[nvy],--"of
   the land," in the Septuagint. What is meant is, every wild beast that
   belonged to that country.--Ed.

   [105] Both Newcome and Henderson render the two words, "the pelican and
   the porcupine." The former says that [q't], "pelican," comes from
   [q'h], to vomit, because it casts up fish or water from its
   membranaceous bag; and [qphd], "porcupine," according to Bochart, is
   from the verb, which means to cut off as by a bite, or rather, he says,
   from its Syriac meaning, to dread, for it is a solitary animal. See
   Newcome. But Parkhurst contends that it is the hedgehog, and both the
   Septuagint and Vulgate render it so. What Calvin translates "in
   postibus ejus," [vkphtvyh], is rendered by Newcome, "in the carved
   lintels thereof," by Henderson, "in her capitals," and by Parkhurst,
   "in her door-porches," i.e. when thrown down.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 2:15

   15. This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her
   heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a
   desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth
   by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.

   15. Haec urbs exultabunda, quae sedebat confidenter, quae dicebat in
   corde suo, Ego et non praeter me amplius: quomodo facta est in
   vastationem, cubile animalibus? Quisquis transierit (vel, omnis viator)
   super eam subilabit, agitabit manum suam.


   He seems to have added this by way of anticipation, lest the
   magnificent splendor of the city Nineveh should frighten the Jews, as
   though it were exempt from all danger. The Prophet therefore reminds
   them here, that though Nineveh was thus proud of its wealth, it could
   not yet escape the hand of God; nay, he shows that the greatness, on
   account of which Nineveh extolled itself, would be the cause of its
   ruin; for it would cast itself down by its own pride: as a wall, when
   it swells, will not long stand; so also men, when they inwardly swell,
   and vent their own boastings, burst; and though no one pushes them
   down, they fall of themselves. Such a destruction the Prophet denounces
   on the Ninevites and the Assyrians.

   This, he says, is the exulting city, which sat in confidence. Isaiah
   reprobates in nearly the same words the pride of Babylon: but what
   Isaiah said of Babylon our Prophet justly transfers here to Nineveh.
   But he no doubt had respect to the Jews, and exhibits Nineveh in its
   state of ruin, lest the power of that city should dazzle their eyes;
   for we are seized with wonder, when anything grand and splendid
   presents itself to us. Here then Zephaniah makes a representation of
   Nineveh and sets it before the Jews: Behold, he says, ye see this city
   full of exultation; ye also see that it rests as in a state of safety;
   for it is conscious of no fear; it regards itself exempt from the
   common lot of men, as though it was built in the clouds. This city, he
   says, is above all others celebrated; but let not frail and evanescent
   splendor terrify you; for God will doubtless in his own time overthrow
   it and reduce it to nothing.

   Let us also in the meantime observe what I have lately referred
   to,--that the cause of the ruin of Nineveh is described, which was,
   that it had promised to itself a perpetuity in the world. But let us
   remember, that in this city is presented to us an example, which
   belongs in common to all nations,--that God cannot endure the
   presumption of men, when inflated by their own greatness and power,
   they do not think themselves to be men, nor humble themselves in a way
   suitable to the condition of men, but forget themselves, as though they
   could exalt themselves above the heavens.

   But it is necessary to examine the words: Nineveh said in her heart, I,
   and besides me no other. By these words the Prophet means, that Nineveh
   was so blinded by its splendor that it now defied every change of
   fortune. Had Babylon spoken thus, it would have been no wonder, for it
   had taken from Nineveh its sovereignty. But we see that the same pride
   infatuates people as well as superior kings; for each thinks himself to
   be great alone, and when he compares himself with others, he looks on
   them as far below him, as though they were placed beneath his feet.
   Thus then the Prophet shows in few words what was the cause of the ruin
   of Nineveh: it thought that its condition on the earth was fixed and
   perpetual. If then we desire to be protected by God's hand, let us bear
   in mind what our condition is, and daily, yea, hourly prepare ourselves
   for a change, except God be pleased to sustain us. Our stability is to
   depend only on the aid of God, and from consciousness of our infirmity,
   to tremble in ourselves, lest a forgetfulness of our state should creep
   in.

   He afterwards adds, How has it become a desolation? The Prophet
   accommodates his words to the capacities of men: for the ruin of
   Nineveh might have appeared incredible. Hence the Prophet by a question
   rouses the minds of the faithful, that they might not doubt the truth
   of what God declared, for he would work in an extraordinary manner.
   This how then intimates, that the Jews ought not to be incredulous,
   while thinking that Nineveh was on all sides fortified, so as to
   prevent the occurrence of anything disastrous: for God would, in a
   wonderful manner and beyond what is usual, overthrow it. How, then, has
   it become a desolation, a resting-place for beasts?

   He then subjoins, Every one who passes by will hiss and shake his hand.
   The Prophet seems to point out the future reproach of Nineveh, and to
   confirm also by a different mode of speaking what he had before said,
   that its ruin would be wonderful; for the shaking of the hand and
   hissing are marks of reproach: Behold Nineveh, which so much flattered
   itself! we now see only its sad ruins. The Prophet, I have no doubt,
   means here by hissing and the shaking of the hind, that Nineveh would
   become an ignominious spectacle to all people: and the same mode of
   speaking often occurs in the Prophets. All shall hiss at thee; that is,
   I will make thee a reproach and a disgrace. Then the Prophet, as I have
   already said, still declares the same truths that the ruin of Nineveh
   would be like a miracle; for all those who pass by would be amazed; as
   though he had said, Behold, they will hiss--What is this? and then they
   will shake the hand--What can be firm in this world? We see the
   principal seat of empire demolished, and differing nothing from a
   desert. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet.

   As this doctrine is also necessary for us at this day, we must notice
   the circumstances to which we have referred. If, then, our enemies
   triumph now, and their haughtiness is intolerable, let us know, that
   the sooner the vengeance of God will overtake them; if they are become
   insensible in their prosperity, and secure, and despise all dangers,
   they thus provoke God's wrath, and especially if to their pride and
   hardness they add cruelty, so as basely to persecute the Church of God,
   to spoil, to plunder, and to slay his people, as we see them doing.
   Since then our enemies are so wanton, we may see as in a mirror their
   near destruction, such as is foretold by the Prophet: for he spoke not
   only of his own age, but designed to teach us, by the prophetic spirit,
   how dear to God is the safety of his Church; and the future lot of the
   ungodly till the end of the world will no doubt be such as Nineveh is
   described here to have been that though they swell with pride for a
   time, and promise themselves every success against the innocent, God
   will yet put a stop to their insolence and check their cruelty, when
   the proper time shall come. I shall not today begin the third chapter,
   for it contains a new subject.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou triest us in the warfare of the
   cross, and arouses most powerful enemies, whose barbarity might justly
   terrify and dishearten us, were we not depending on thine aid,--O
   grant, that we may call to mind how wonderfully thou didst in former
   times deliver thy chosen people, and how seasonably thou didst bring
   them help, when they were oppressed and entirely overwhelmed, so that
   we may learn at this day to flee to thy protection, and not doubt, but
   that when thou becomest propitious to us, there is in thee sufficient
   power to preserve us, and to lay prostrate our enemies, how much soever
   they may now exult and think to triumph above the heavens, so that they
   may at length know by experience that they are earthly and frail
   creatures, whose life and condition is like the mist which soon
   vanishes: and may we learn to aspire after that blessed eternity, which
   is laid up for us in heaven by Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Zephaniah 3:1, 2

   1. Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!

   1. Vae pollutae et inquinatae, urbi direptrici (vel, fraudatrici.)

   2. She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted
   not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.

   2. Non audivit ad vocem; non suscepit disciplinam (vel, correctionem;)
   in Iehova non est confisa; ad Deum suum non appropinquarit.


   The Prophet speaks here again against Jerusalem; for first, the Jews
   ought ever to have been severely reproved, as they were given to many
   sins; and secondly, because there was always there some seed which
   needed consolation: and this has been the way pursued, as we have
   hitherto seen, by all the Prophets. But we must also bear in mind, that
   the books now extant were made up of prophetic addresses, that we might
   understand what was the sum of the doctrine delivered.

   The Prophet here makes this charge against the Jews, that they were
   polluted and become filthy. And he addresses Jerusalem, where the
   sanctuary was; and it might therefore seem to have been superior to
   other cities; for God had not in vain chosen that as the place for his
   worship. But the Prophet shows how empty and fallacious was any
   boasting of this kind; for the city which God had consecrated for
   himself had polluted itself with many sins. The Prophet seems to allude
   to the ancient rites of the law, which, though many, had been
   prescribed, we know, by God, that the people might observe a holy
   course of life: for the ceremonies could not of themselves wash away
   their filth; but the people were instructed by these external things to
   worship God in a holy and pure manner. As then they often washed
   themselves with water, and as they carefully observed other rites of
   outward sanctity, the Prophet derides their hypocrisy, for they did not
   regard the real design of the ceremonies. Hence he says, that they were
   polluted, though in appearance they might be deemed the most pure; for
   they were defiled as to their whole life. [106]

   He adds that the city was hyvnh, eiune; some render it the city of
   dove, or, a dove; for the word has this meaning: and they take it
   metaphorically for a foolish and thoughtless city, as we find it to be
   so understood in Hosea 7:11; where Ephraim was said to be a dove,
   because the people were void of reason and knowledge, and of their own
   accord exposed themselves to traps and snares. Some then consider this
   place to have this meaning,--that Jerusalem, which ought to have been
   wise, was yet wholly fatuitous and foolish. But it may be easily
   gathered from the context, that the Prophet means another thing, even
   this,--that Jerusalem was given to plunder and fraud; for the verb ynh,
   ine, signifies to defraud and to take by force what belongs to another;
   and it means also to circumvent as well as to plunder. He therefore
   means no doubt, that Jerusalem was a city full of every kind of
   iniquity, as he had before called it a polluted city; and then he adds
   an explanation.

   The Prophet in the first verse seems to have in view the two tables of
   the law. God, we know, requires in the law that his people should be
   holy; and then he teaches the way of living justly and innocently.
   Hence when the Prophet called Jerusalem a polluted city, he meant
   briefly to show that the whole worship of God was there corrupted, and
   that no regard for true religion flourished there; for the Jews thought
   that they had performed all their duty to God, when they washed away
   their filth by water. Such was the extremely foolish notion which they
   entertained: but we know and they ought to have known that the worship
   of God is spiritual. He afterwards adds, that the city was rapacious,
   under which term he includes every kind of injustice.

   It follows, She heard not the voice, she received not correction. The
   Prophet now explains and defines what the pollution was of which he had
   spoken: for true religion begins with teachableness; when we submit to
   God and to his word, it is really to enter on the work of worshipping
   him aright. But when heavenly truth is despised, though men may toil
   much in outward rites, yet their impiety discovers itself by their
   contumacy, inasmuch as they suffer not themselves to be ruled by God's
   authority. Hence the Prophet shows, that whatever the Jews thought of
   their purity at Jerusalem, it was nothing but filth and pollution. He
   says, that they were unteachable, because they did not hear the
   Prophets sent to them by God.

   This ought to be carefully noticed; for without this beginning many
   torment themselves in the work of serving God, and do nothing, because
   obedience is better than sacrifice. If, then, we wish our efforts to be
   approved by God, we must begin with faith; for except the word of God
   obtains credit with us, whatever we may offer to him are mere human
   inventions. It is, in the second place, added, that they did not
   receive correction; and this was no superfluous addition. For when God
   sees that we are not submissive, and that we do not willingly come to
   him when he calls us, he strengthens his instruction by chastisements.
   He allures us at first to himself, he employs kind and gentle
   invitations; but when he sees us delaying, or even going back, he
   begins to treat us more roughly and more severely: for teaching without
   the goads of reproof would have no effect. But when God teaches and
   reproves in vain, it then appears that our disposition is wicked and
   perverse. So the Prophet intended here to show the wickedness of his
   people as extreme, by saying, that they heard not the voice nor
   received correction; as though he had said, that the wickedness of his
   people was unhealable, for they not only rejected the doctrine of
   salvation, when offered, but also obstinately rejected all warnings,
   and would not bear any correction.

   But we must bear in mind, that the Prophet had to do with that holy
   people whom God had chosen as his peculiar treasure. There is therefore
   no reason why those who profess the name of Christians at this day
   should exempt themselves from this condemnation; for our condition is
   not better than the condition of that people. Jerusalem was in an
   especial manner, as we have already said, the sanctuary, as it were, of
   God: and yet we see how severely the Prophet reproves Jerusalem and all
   its inhabitants. We have no cause to flatter ourselves, except we
   willingly submit to God, and suffer ourselves to be ruled by his word,
   and except we also patiently bear correction, when his teaching takes
   no suitable effect, and when there is need of sharp goads to stimulate
   us.

   He afterwards adds, that it did not trust in the Lord, nor draw nigh to
   its God. The Prophet discovers here more clearly the spring of
   impiety--that Jerusalem placed not the hope of salvation in God alone;
   for from hence flowed all the mass of evils which prevailed; because if
   we inquire how it is that men burn with avarice, why they are
   insatiable, and why they wantonly defraud and plunder one another, we
   shall find the cause to be this--that they trust not in God. Rightly
   then does the Prophet mention this here, among other pollutions at
   Jerusalem, as the chief--that it did not put its trust in God. The same
   also is the cause and origin of all superstitions; for if men felt
   assured that God alone is enough for them, they would not follow here
   and there their own inventions. We hence see that unbelief is not only
   the mother of all the evil deeds by which men willfully wrong and
   injure one another, but that it is also the cause of all superstitions.

   He says, in the last place, that it did not draw nigh to God. The
   Prophet no doubt charges the Jews that they willfully departed from God
   when he was nigh them; yea, that they wholly alienated themselves from
   him, while he was ready to cherish them, as it were, in his own bosom.
   This is indeed a sin common to all who seek not God; but Jerusalem
   sinned far more grievously, because she would not draw nigh to God, by
   whom she saw that she was sought. For why was the law given, why was
   adoption vouchsafed, and in short, why had they the various ordinances
   of religion, except that they might join themselves to God? And now
   Israel,' said Moses, what does the Lord thy God require of thee, except
   to cleave to him?' God thus intended his law to be, as it were, a
   sacred bond of union between him and the Jews. Now when they wandered
   here and there, that they might not be united to him, it was a
   diabolical madness. Hence the Prophet here does not only accuse the
   Jews of not seeking God, but of withdrawing themselves from him; and
   thus they were ungovernable. The Lord sought to tame them; but they
   were like wild beasts. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [106] The first word, [mvr'h], is rendered "rebellions" by Newcome and
   Henderson. The Vulgate is nearly the same, "provocatrix--provoking."
   The verb is [mr'], once in Hiphil in Job 39:8; and to take it to be the
   same with [mrh], to rebel, is gratuitous. The context in Job shows its
   idea to be that of raising up or swelling; and Parkhurst very properly
   renders the participle here, swelling, arrogant, insolent; and this
   notion entirely corresponds with the character given of the city in the
   next verse; being arrogant, it did "not hear the voice" of God. The
   verse may be rendered thus -- Woe to the arrogant and polluted,
   The city, which is an oppressor! Then follows a specification as to her
   conduct,-- She has not hearkened to the voice,
   She has not received instruction;
   In Jehovah has she not trusted,
   To her God has she not drawn nigh. To "obey the voice," as given in our
   version and by Newcome, is not quite correct; she was too arrogant even
   to hear or attend to the voice. "Correction," as in our version, and by
   Calvin, is rendered "instruction" by Newcome and Henderson; for [mvsr]
   has often this meaning. The Septuagint have paidaian--discipline. But
   the same phrase occurs in verse 7, where the word necessarily means
   instruction, by way of warning, communicated by the example of
   others.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 3:3

   3. Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening
   wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

   3. Principes ejus in medio ejus, leones rugientes; judices ejus lupi
   vespertini, non lacerant ad mane (alii non differunt, nempe ossa
   comminuere; sed [mrg], proprie significat, conterere vel, frangere ergo
   de ossibus loquitur Propheta, quod scilicet non expectarent usque ad
   mane, ut ipsa contererent dentibus; sed prae fame, vel potius rabie
   praedam statim lacerarent; imo etiam contererent ossa dentibus.)


   The Prophet now explains what we have stated respecting plunder and
   fraud. He confirms that he had not without reason called Jerusalem
   hyvnh, eiune, a rapacious city, or one given to plunder; for the
   princes were like lions and the judges like wolves. And when he speaks
   of judges, he does not spare the common people; but he shows that all
   orders were then corrupt: for though no justice or equity is regarded
   by the people, there will yet remain some shame among the judges, so as
   to retain the people at least within some limits, that an extreme
   licentiousness may not prevail: but when robbery is practiced in the
   court of justice, what can be said of such a city? We hence see that
   the Prophet in these words describes an extreme confusion: The princes
   of Jerusalem, he says, are lions. And we have elsewhere similar
   declarations; for the Prophets, when it was their object to condemn all
   from the least to the greatest, did yet direct their discourse
   especially to the judges.

   And this is worthy of being noticed, for there was then no Church of
   God, except at Jerusalem. Yet the Prophet says, that the judges, and
   prophets, and priests, were all apostates. What comfort could the
   faithful have had? But we hence see that the fear of God had not wholly
   failed in his elect, and that they firmly and with an invincible heart
   contended against all offenses and trials of this kind. Let us also
   learn to fortify ourselves at this day with the same courage, so that
   we may not faint, however much impiety may everywhere prevail, and all
   religion may seem extinct among men.

   But we may also hence learn, how foolishly the Papists pride themselves
   in their vain titles, as though they thought that God was bound as it
   were to them, because they have bishops and pastors. But the Prophet
   shows, that even those who performed the ordinary office of executing
   the laws could yet be the wicked and perfidious despisers of God. He
   also shows, that neither prophets nor priests ought to be spared; for
   when God sets them over his Church, he gives them no power to
   tyrannize, so that they might dare to do anything with impunity, and
   not be reproved. For though the priesthood under the law was sacred, we
   yet see that it was subject to correction. So let no one at this day
   claim for himself a privilege, as though he was exempt from all
   instruction and reproof, while occupying a high station among the
   people of God.

   He distinguishes between princes and judges; and the reason is, because
   the kingdom was as yet standing. So the courtiers, who were in favor
   and authority with the king, drew a part of the spoil to themselves,
   and the judges devoured another part. Though Scripture often makes no
   difference between these two names, yet I doubt not but he means by
   srym, sherim, princes, the chiefs who were courtiers; and he calls them
   sphtym, shepthim, judges, who administered justice. And he says that
   the judges were evening wolves, that is, hungry, for wolves become
   furious in the evening when they have been roaming about all day and
   have found nothing. As their want sharpens the savageness of wolves, so
   the Prophet says that the judges were hungry like evening wolves, whose
   hunger renders them furious. And for the same purpose he adds, that
   they broke not the bones in the morning; that is, they waited not till
   the dawn to break the bones; [107] for when they devoured the flesh
   they also employed their teeth in breaking the bones, because their
   voracity was so great. We now apprehend the Prophet's meaning. It
   afterwards follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [107] This is the explanation of Grotius, Mede, and Henderson. The
   latter's version is--"They gnaw no bones in the morning;" i.e., all is
   devoured in the night. Newcome, adopting the conjecture of Houbigant,
   supposes the true reading to be [ydmv], and gives this rendering--"They
   wait not until the morning," which seems to have no meaning in this
   connection. What Cocceius proposes is more probable--"Who have not
   gnawed in the morning;" and on this account they were exceedingly
   voracious in the evening. But the idea of our common version is very
   appropriate; it implies that they were like wild beasts prowling all
   night, and carrying as it were their prey to their dens, that they
   might devour it there in the morning. This is the view taken by Henry.
   "They devour the flesh," says Adam Clarke, "in the night, and gnaw the
   bones, and extract the marrow afterwards."--Ed.

   Zephaniah 3:4

   4. Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have
   polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.

   4. Prophetae ejus leves (vel, futiles,) viri transgressionum;
   sacerdotes ejus polluerunt sanctum (vel, sanctuarium,) sustulerunt
   legem.


   The Prophet again reverts to the pollution and filth of which he has
   spoken in the first verse. He shows that he had not without reason
   cried against the polluted city; for though the Jews used their
   washings, they could not yet make themselves clean in this manner
   before God, as the whole of religion was corrupted by them.

   He says that the Prophets were light. He alone speaks here, and he
   condemns the many. We hence see that there is no reason why the ungodly
   should allege their great number, when God by his word accuses them, as
   the Papists do at this day, who deny it to be right in one or two, or
   few men, to speak against their impiety, however bad the state of
   things may be; there must be the consent of the whole world, as though
   the Prophet was not alone, and had not to contend with a great many. It
   is indeed true that he taught at the same time with the Prophet
   Jeremiah, as we have elsewhere seen; but yet hardly two or three did
   then discharge faithfully their office of teaching; and from this and
   other places we learn that the false Prophets, relying on their number,
   were on that account bolder. But Zephaniah did not for this reason
   cease to cry against them. However much then the false Prophets raged
   against him, and terrified him by the show of their number, he still
   exercised his liberty in condemning them. So at this day, though the
   whole world should unite in promoting impiety, there is yet no reason
   why the few should be disheartened when observing the worship of God
   perverted; but they ought on the contrary to encourage themselves by
   this example, and strenuously to resist thousands of men if necessary;
   for no union formed by men can possibly lessen the authority of God.

   It now follows that they were men of transgressions. What we render
   light, others render empty; (vacuous;) but the word phvchzym, puchezim,
   means strictly men of nought, and also the rash, and those who are void
   of judgment as well as of all moderation. In short, it is the same as
   though the Prophet had said that they were stupid and blind; and he
   says afterwards that they were fraudulent, than which there is nothing
   more inconsistent with the Prophetic office. But Zephaniah shows that
   the whole order was then so degenerated among the people, that the
   thickest darkness prevailed among those very leaders whose office it
   was to bring forth the light of celestial truth. And he makes a
   concession by calling them Prophets. The same we do at this day when we
   speak of Popish bishops. It is indeed certain that they are unworthy of
   so honorable a title; for they are blinder than moles, so that they are
   far from being overseers. We also know, that they are like brute
   beasts; for they are immersed in their lusts: in short, they are
   unworthy to be called men. But we concede to them this title, in order
   that their turpitude may be more apparent. The Prophet did the same,
   when he said, that the Jews did not draw nigh to their God; he conceded
   to them what they boasted; for they ever wished to be regarded as the
   holy and peculiar people of God: but their ingratitude did hence become
   more evident, because they went back and turned to another object, when
   God was ready to embrace them, as though they designedly meant to show
   that they had nothing to do with him. It is then the same manner of
   speaking, that Zephaniah adopts here, when he says, that the Prophets
   were light and men of transgressions. [108]

   He then adds, The priests have polluted the holy place. The tribe of
   Levi, we know, had been chosen by God; and those who descended from
   him, were to be ministers and teachers to others: and for this reason
   the Lord in the law ordered the Levites to be dispersed through the
   whole country. He might indeed have given them as to the rest, a fixed
   habitation; but his will was, that they should be dispersed among the
   whole population, that no part of the land should be without good and
   faithful ministers. The Prophet now charges them, that they had
   polluted the holy place. By the word qds, kodash the Prophet means
   whatsoever is holy; at the same time he speaks of the sanctuary.
   Moreover, since the sanctuary was as it were the dwelling-place of God,
   when the Prophets speak of divine worship and religion, they include
   the whole under the word, Temple, as in this place. He says then that
   the sanctuary was polluted by the priests, and then that they took away
   or subverted the law. [109]

   We here see how boldly the Prophet charges the priests. There is then
   no reason why they who are divinely appointed over the Church should
   claim for themselves the liberty of doing what they please; for the
   priests might have boasted of this privilege, that without dispute
   everything was lawful for them. But we see that God not only calls them
   to order by his Prophets, but even blames them more than others,
   because they were less excusable. Now the Papists boast, that the
   clergy, even the very dregs collected from the filthiest filth, cannot
   err; which is extremely absurd; for they are not better than the
   successors of Aaron. But we see what the Prophet objects now to
   them,--that they subverted the law: he not only condemns their life,
   but says also, that they were perfidious towards God; for they
   strangely corrupted the whole truth of religion. The Papists confess,
   that they indeed can sin, but that the sin dwells only in their moral
   conduct. They yet seek to exempt themselves from all the danger of
   going astray. Though the Levitical priests were indeed chosen by the
   very voice of God, we yet see that they were apostates. But God
   confirms the godly, that they might not abandon themselves to impiety,
   though they saw their very leaders going astray, and rushing headlong
   into ruin. For it behaved the faithful to fortify themselves with
   constancy, when the priests not only by their bad conduct withdrew the
   people from every fear of God, but also perverted every sound doctrine;
   it behaved, I say, the faithful to remain then invincible. Though then
   at this day those who hold the highest dignity in the Church neglect
   God and even despise every celestial truth, and thus rush headlong into
   ruin, and though they attempt to turn God's truth into falsehood, yet
   let our faith continue firm; for John has not without reason declared,
   that it ought to be victorious against the whole world. 1 John 5:4. It
   follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [108] Her prophets are light, they are treacherous men.--Newcome. Her
   prophets are vainglorious, hypocritical men.--Henderson. The word
   rendered "light," as a river, and not "unstable," as in our version. It
   is applied as a participle in Judges 9:4, to designate persons
   overflowing in wickedness, dissolute, licentious, dissipated; and as a
   noun in Jeremiah 23:32, to set forth the licentious conduct of the
   false prophets, who like the priests under the Papacy, were given to
   lasciviousness, and "committed adultery with their neighbors' wives,"
   Jeremiah 29:23. See also Jeremiah 23:14. As Zephaniah was contemporary
   with Jeremiah, his description of the Prophets is thus seen to be the
   same, "Her Prophets are licentious," or lascivious. Men of
   dissimulations or deceits, ['nsy vgdvt], signify, that under the
   pretense of telling the truth, they delivered what was false; or in the
   words of Jeremiah, they "caused the people to err by their lies," while
   they pretended to deliver true messages from God: so that Jeremiah
   23:32, contains an explanation of this clause. "Deceiving men" would
   perhaps be the best rendering. Though they were licentious, yet they
   deceived men, and made them to believe that they were true Prophets.
   They were impostors, and notwithstanding their immoral character, they
   persuaded deluded men that they were true and faithful.--Ed.

   [109] The word, [qds], as Calvin intimates, does not specifically mean
   the sanctuary, but holiness, or, as Henderson renders it, "what is
   sacred," or holy. Both our version and Newcome improperly render it
   "the sanctuary." The explanation of what is meant may be found in
   Ezekiel 12:2. The word for sanctuary is [mqds]. See Ezekiel 23:38,39
   The words, [chmsv tvrh], have been taken to mean,--either, "They
   violated the law," as the words are rendered in Ezekiel 12:26, that is,
   transgressed it by acting contrary to it; or, "They perverted the law,"
   forcing it, as it were, out of its plain meaning by subtle glosses. The
   Septuagint render the verb ethetesan--set aside or abolished, in
   Ezekiel, and here asebousi--act impiously. "Trangressed," says Grotius;
   "Do violence to," say Piscator and Drusius, that is, by wresting its
   words. It occurs much oftener as a noun than as a verb, and it commonly
   means a wrong or injustice done in an outrageous and violent manner.
   According to this general idea, we may render the phrase here, "they
   have outraged the law," either by their conduct, or by their comments.
   It was in either case a wrong done to the law, that was enormous,
   passing all reason and decency. So that to transgress or to violate, or
   to do violence to, or to pervert the law, does not convey the full
   meaning.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 3:5

   5. The just Lord is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity:
   every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but
   the unjust knoweth no shame.

   5. Iehova justus in medio ejus, non faciet iniquitatem: mane, mane
   judicium suum proferet in lucem, non deficiet: neque tamen congnoscet
   iniquus pudorem.


   Here the Prophet throws back against hypocrites what they were wont to
   pretend, when they sought wickedly to reject every instruction and all
   warnings; for they said, that God dwelt in the midst of them, like the
   Papists at the present day, who raise up this as their shield against
   us,--that the Church is the pillar of the truth. Hence they think that
   all their wicked deeds are defended by this covering. So the Jews at
   that time had this boast ever on their lips,--We are notwithstanding
   the holy people of God, and he dwells in the midst of us, for he is
   worshipped in the Temple, which has been built, not according to men's
   will, but by his command; for that voice proceeded not from earth, but
   came from heaven, This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell.' Psalm
   132:14. Since then the Jews were inflated with this presumption, the
   Prophet concedes what they claimed, that God dwelt among them; but it
   was for a far different purpose, which was, that they might understand,
   that his hand was nigh to punish their sins. This is one thing.

   Jehovah is in the midst of them; Granted, he says; I allow that he
   dwells in this city; for he has commanded a temple to be built for him
   on Mount Sion, he has ordered a holy altar for himself; but why does
   God dwell among you, and has preferred this habitation to all others?
   Surely, he says, he will not do iniquity. Consider now what the nature
   of God is; for when he purposed to dwell among you, he certainly did
   not deny himself, nor did he cease to be what he is. There is therefore
   no reason for you to imagine, as though God intended, for the sake of
   those to whom he bound himself, to throw aside his own justice, or
   intended to pollute himself by the defilements of men. He warns the
   Jews, that they absurdly blended these things together. God then who
   dwells in the midst of you, will not do iniquity; that is, He will not
   approve of your evil deeds; and though he may for a time connive at
   them, he will not yet bear with them continually. Do not therefore
   foolishly flatter yourselves, as though God were the approver of your
   wickedness.

   Some apply this to the people,--that they ought not to have done
   iniquity; but this is a strained exposition, and altogether foreign to
   the context. Most other interpreters give this meaning, that God is
   just and will do no iniquity, for he had sufficient reasons for
   executing his vengeance on a people so wicked. They hence think, that
   the Prophet anticipates the Jews, lest they murmured, as though the
   Lord was cruel or too rigid. He will not do iniquity, that is, Though
   the Lord may inflict on you a most grievous punishment, yet he cannot
   be arraigned by you as unjust; and ye in vain contend with him, for he
   will ever be found to be a righteous judge. But this also is a very
   frigid explanation. Let us bear in mind what I have already said,--that
   the Prophet here, by way of irony, concedes to the Jews, that God dwelt
   among them, but afterwards brings against them what they thought was a
   protection to them,-- God dwells in the midst of you; I allow it, he
   says; but is not he a just God? Do not then dream that he is one like
   yourselves, that he approves of your evil deeds. God will not do
   iniquity; ye cannot prevail with him to renounce himself, or to change
   his own nature. Why then does God dwell in the midst of you? In the
   morning, in the morning, he says, his judgment will he bring forth to
   light; the Lord will daily bring forth his judgment. How this is to be
   understood, we shall explain tomorrow.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as thou hast deigned to favor us
   with an honor so invaluable, as to adopt us for a holy people to thee,
   and to separate us from the world,--O grant, that we may not close our
   eyes against the light of thy truth, by which thou showest to us the
   way of salvation; but may we with true docility follow where thou
   callest us, and never cast away the fear of thy majesty, nor mock thee
   with frivolous ceremonies, but strive sincerely to devote ourselves
   wholly to thee, and to cleanse ourselves from all defilements, not only
   of the flesh, but also of the spirit, that by thus seeking true
   holiness, we may aspire after and diligently labor for that heavenly
   perfection, from which we are as yet far distant; and may we in the
   meantime, relying on the favor of thy only-begotten Son, lean on thy
   mercy; and while depending on it, may we ever grow up more and more
   into that true and perfect union, reserved for us in heaven, when we
   shall be made partakers of thy glory, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Twenty-fifth

   We began yesterday to explain the passage, where the Prophet says, that
   God dwelt at Jerusalem, but that he was notwithstanding just, and could
   not possibly associate with the ungodly and the wicked, because he
   changes not his nature to suit the humor of men.

   It now follows, In the morning, in the morning, his judgment will he
   bring forth to light: by which words he means, either that God would be
   the avenger of wickedness, which seems to escape, as it were, his eyes,
   while he delays his punishment, or that he is ready to restore his
   people, whenever they are attentive to instruction. If the former view
   be approved, the sense will be this,--that hypocrites foolishly flatter
   themselves, when God spares them; for he will suddenly ascend his
   tribunal that he may visit them with punishment. Some however choose to
   apply this to the judgments executed on the Gentiles, of which the Jews
   had not once nor twice been reminded, but often, that they might in
   time repent. But there is no doubt but that the Prophet refers here to
   a judgment belonging to the Jews.

   Let us now see whether this judgment is pronounced or inflicted. It
   would not ill suit the passage to understand it of the vengeance which
   God was hastening to execute, for the Jews were worthy of what had been
   severely threatened, because they falsely professed his name; and while
   they absurdly boasted that he dwelt among them, they withdrew
   themselves very far from him. It is however no less suitable to refer
   this to teaching, so that the Prophet thus enhanced the sin of the
   people, because they had hardened themselves after so many and so
   constant warnings, which continually sounded in their ears, as God
   elsewhere complains, that though he rose early, and indeed daily, this
   solicitude had been without its fruit. The verb in the future tense
   will thus signify a continued act, for God ceased not to exhort to
   repentance those wretched beings who had ears which were deaf. And this
   view strikingly corresponds with what immediately follows, that he
   fails not; for such a perseverance was a proof of unwearied mercy, when
   God continued to send Prophets one after the other.

   He now adds, The wicked knows no shame. He means what he has just
   referred to--that the people had become so hardened in their wickedness
   that they could not be reformed, either by instruction or by threats,
   or by the scourges of God.

   If we refer judgment to teaching, which I approve, the meaning will
   be--that though God, by making known daily his law, kindled as it were
   a lamp, which discovered all evils, yet the ungodly were not ashamed.
   But if we understand it, as they say, of actual judgment, the meaning
   will be in substance the same--that the ungodly repented not, though
   the hand of God openly appeared; and though he rose to judgment, yet he
   says, they knew not what it was to feel ashamed. As to the main subject
   there is no ambiguity; for the Prophet means only that the people were
   past recovery; for though God proved himself a judge by manifest
   evidences, and even by his own law, they yet felt no shame, but went on
   in their wicked courses. The word judgment, in the singular number,
   seems to have been put here in the sense of a rule, by which men live
   religiously and justly, and a rule which ought to make men ashamed.
   [110] It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [110] The verbs here are in the future tense, but evidently express, as
   Calvin observes, a continued act. The same is exactly the case in
   Welsh; the verbs are in the future tense, but are understood as
   expressing a present act or a continued act, or what is continually or
   habitually done. In English the present must be adopted-- The righteous
   Jehovah is in the midst of her,
   He doeth no injustice:
   Every morning his judgment
   He bringeth to light -- it fails not;
   Yet the unjust knoweth no shame. "Injustice" in the second, and
   "unjust" in the fifth line, come from the same root. "Judgment" here is
   what God judges and determines to be right and just; and it is set
   forth here as the sun rising every day from morning to morning, and as
   never failing to appear.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 3:6, 7

   6. I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their
   streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so
   that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.

   6. Excidi gentes; vastate sunt arces earum; perdidi vicos earum, ut
   nemo transeat; vastatae sunt urbes earum, ut non sit vir, no sit qui
   habitet.

   7. I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so
   their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but
   they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.

   7. Dixi, certe timebis me, suscipies disciplinam; et non excidetur
   habitatio ejus, quicquid visitavi super eam: certe properarunt,
   corruperunt omnia studia sua.


   Here the Prophet shows in another way that there was no hope for a
   people, who could not have been instructed by the calamities of others,
   to seek to return to God's favor. For God here complains that he had in
   vain punished neighboring nations, and made them examples, in order to
   recall the Jews to himself. Had they been of a sane mind they might
   have been led, by their quiet state, while God spared them, to consider
   what they had deserved--If this is done in the green tree, what at
   length will be done in the dry? They might then have thought within
   themselves, that a most grievous calamity was at hand, except they
   anticipated God's wrath, which had grown ripe against them; and God
   also testified that he intended by such examples to stay the judgment
   which he might have already justly executed on them. As they then even
   hastened it, it is evident that their wickedness was past remedy. This
   is the sum of the whole.

   He says first, I have cut off nations; by which words he shows that he
   warned the Jews to repent, not only by one example, but by many
   examples; for not one instance only of God's wrath had appeared, but
   God had on all sides manifested himself to be a judge, in inflicting
   punishment on one nation after another. Since then they had been so
   often warned, we may hence learn that they were wholly blinded by their
   wickedness.

   He now enhances the atrocity of the punishment inflicted, and says,
   that citadels had been demolished and streets cut off, that no one
   passed through; and then, that cities had been reduced to solitude, so
   that there was no inhabitant. For when punishment is of an ordinary
   kind, it is wont, for the most part, to be disregarded; but when God
   showed, by so remarkable proofs, that he was displeased with the
   nations, that is, with the ignorant, who in comparison with the Jews
   were innocent, how could such an instance as this be disregarded by the
   Jews, whom God thus recalled to himself, except that they were of a
   disposition wholly desperate and irreclaimable? We now then see why the
   Prophet enlarges on the punishments which, having been inflicted on the
   nations, ought to have been considered by the Jews. [111]

   He now subjoins the object which God had in view, I said, Surely thou
   wilt fear me. Here God assumes the character of man, as he does often
   elsewhere: for he does not wait for what is future, as though he was
   doubtful; but all things, as we know, are before his eyes. Hence God
   was not deceived, as though something had happened beyond his
   expectation; but as I have already said, he undertakes here the
   character of man; for he could not otherwise have sufficiently
   expressed how inexcusable the Jews were who had despised all his
   warnings. For what was God's design when he punished the heathens, one
   nation after another, except that the Jews might be awakened by the
   evils of others, and not provoke his wrath against themselves? Paul
   makes use of the same argument.

   On account of these things,' he says,
   the wrath of God comes upon all the unbelieving.'
   Romans 1:17 [Ephesians 5:6, Colossians 3:6].

   Inasmuch as men for the most part deceive themselves by self-flatteries
   and cherish with extreme indulgence their own wickedness, Paul says,
   that the wrath of God comes on the unbelieving: and it is a singular
   proof of God's love, that he does not immediately assail us, but sets
   before us the examples of others. As when any one lays hold of his
   servant in the presence of his son, and punishes him severely, the son
   must be moved by the sight, except he be wholly an abandoned character:
   however, in such a case the father's love manifests itself; for he
   withholds his hand from his son and inflicts punishment on the servant,
   and this for the benefit of his son, that he may learn wisdom by what
   another suffers. God declares in this place that he had done the same;
   but he complains that it had been without benefit, for the Jews had
   frustrated his purpose.

   It may be here asked, whether men so frustrate God that he looks for
   something different from what happens. I have already said, that God
   speaks after the manner of men, and in a language not strictly correct:
   and hence we ought not here to enter or penetrate into the secret
   purpose of God, but to be satisfied with this reason,--that if we
   profit nothing when God warns us either by his word or by his scourges,
   we are then equally guilty, as though he was deceived by us: and hence
   also the madness of those is reproved, who are unwilling to ascribe
   anything to God but what is conveyed in these common forms of speech:
   God says, that he wills the salvation of all, 1 Timothy 2:4;) hence
   there is no election, which makes a distinction between one man and
   another; but the Lord leaves the whole human race to their free-will,
   so that every one may provide for himself as he pleases; otherwise the
   will of God must be twofold. So unlearned men vainly talk; and such not
   only show their ignorance in religion, but are also wholly destitute of
   common sense. For what is more absurd than to conclude, that there is a
   twofold will in God, because he speaks otherwise with us than is
   consistent with his incomprehensible majesty? God's will then is one
   and simple, but manifold as to the perceptions of men; for we cannot
   comprehend his hidden purpose, which angels adore with reverence and
   humility. Hence the Lord accommodates himself to the measure of our
   capacities, as this passage teaches us with sufficient clearness. For
   if we receive what the fanatics imagine, then God is like man, who
   hopes well, and finds afterwards that he has been deceived: but what
   can be more alien to his glory? We hence see how these insane men not
   only obscure the glory of God, but also labor, as far as they can, to
   reduce his whole essence to nothing. But this mode of speaking ought to
   be sufficiently familiar to us,--that God justly complains that he has
   been deceived by us, when we do not repent, inasmuch as he invites us
   to himself, and even stimulates us, I said, Surely thou wilt fear me

   This word said, ought not then to be referred to the hidden counsel of
   God, but to the subject itself, and that is, that it was time to
   repent. Who would not have hoped but that you would have returned to
   the right way? When the next house was on fire, how was it possible for
   you to sleep, except ye were extremely stupid? And when so many
   examples were presented before your eyes without any advantage, it is
   evident that there is no more any hope of repentance. Thou, then, wilt
   fear me; that is, God might have hoped for some amendment, though he
   had not yet touched you even with his smallest finger; for ye beheld,
   while in a tranquil state, how severely he punished the contempt of his
   justice as to the heathens. He uses a similar language in Isaiah 5:4,

   My vine, what have I done to thee? or what could I have done to thee
   more than what I have done? I expected thee to bring forth fruit; but,
   behold, thou hast brought forth wild grapes.'

   God in that passage expostulates with the Jews as though they had by
   their perfidiousness deceived him. But we know, that whatever happens
   was known to him before the creation of the world: but, as I have
   already said, the fact itself is to be regarded by us, and not the
   hidden judgment of God.

   He afterwards adds, Thou wilt receive correction; that is, thou wilt be
   hereafter more tractable: for monstrous is our stupidity, when we fear
   not God's vengeance; when yet it evidently appears that we are warned,
   as I have already said, to repent, by all the examples of judgments
   which are daily presented to us. But if we proceed in our wickedness,
   what else is it but to kick against the goad, as the old proverb is? In
   short, we here see described an extreme wickedness and obstinacy, which
   admitted of no remedy.

   Hence the Prophet adds again, And cut off should not be her habitation,
   howsoever I might have visited her; that is, though the Jews had
   already provoked me, so that the punishment they have deserved was
   nigh; yet I was ready to withdraw my hand and to forgive them, if they
   repented: not that God ever turns aside from his purpose, for there is
   no shadow of turning in him; but he sets before them the fact as it
   was; for the subject here, as I have said, is not respecting the secret
   purpose of God, but we ought to confine ourselves to the means which he
   employs in promoting our salvation. God had already threatened the Jews
   for many years; he had as yet deferred to execute what he had
   threatened. In the meantime his wrath had been manifested through the
   whole neighborhood; the heathen nations had suffered the severest
   judgments. God here declares, that he had been so lenient to his people
   as to give time to repent; and he complains that he had delayed in
   vain, for they had gone on in their wickedness, and had mocked, as it
   were, his patience. When, therefore, he says, Cut off should not be her
   habitation, howsoever I might have visited her, or have visited her, he
   pursues still the same mode of speaking, that is, that he was prepared
   to forgive the Jews, though he had before destined them to destruction;
   not that he, as to himself, would retract that sentence; but that he
   was still reconcilable, if the Jews had been touched by any feeling of
   repentance. [112]

   He at last adds, Surely, (some render it, but,) surely they have
   hastened. The verb skm, shecam, means properly to rise early, but is to
   be taken metaphorically in the sense of hastening; as though he had
   said, They run headlong to corrupt their ways. God had said that he had
   been indulgent to them for this end--that he might lead them by degrees
   to repentance: now he complains, that they on the contrary had run
   another way, when they saw that he suspended his judgments, as though
   it was their designed object to accelerate his wrath. Thus they
   hastened to corrupt their ways. The meaning, then, is that this people
   were not only irreclaimable in their obstinacy, but that they were also
   sottish and presumptuous, as though they wished to hasten the judgment,
   which the Lord was ready for a time to defer. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [111] This verse, literally rendered, is as follows,-- I have cut off
   nations;
   Desolate are become their towers;
   I have made solitary their streets, without a passenger;
   Deserted are become their cities,
   Without a man, without an inhabitant. It is not the destruction. The
   nations being cut off, then the towers became desolate, the streets
   empty, and the cities forsaken. The last line but one is
   literally--"Hunted have been their cities," so that no man was left
   behind.--Ed.

   [112] The last clause has been variously rendered. There is no
   assistance from the Septuagint, as the whole text is very different.
   Marckius, after Drusius, connects it, not with the preceding, but with
   the following line, in this sense, that how much soever God had
   punished the city, yet its inhabitants were the more best to corrupt
   their ways. But the words can hardly admit of this meaning. Henderson
   supposes [k] to be understood before [kl], and gives this rendering of
   the two lines-- That her habitation might not be cut off,
   According to all that I had appointed concerning her. Newcome differs
   as to the last line-- After all the punishment with which I had visited
   her. None of these are satisfactory. Grotius, taking the sense of the
   Targum, means to have given the best meaning. He says that [phqd],
   followed by [l], means sometimes to appoint or constitute, and refers
   to 2 Chronicles 36:23, "All the good which I have appointed to her," or
   promised; but he unnecessarily supposes "shall come" to be understood;
   for the word, "all which," may be considered to be in apposition with
   "habitation." I give the following version of this whole verse-- I
   said, "Surely thou wilt fear me,
   Thou wilt receive instruction;"
   Then cut off should not be her habitation --
   All that I have committed to her:
   Yet they rose up early, they corrupted all their doings. To rise up
   early is a Hebrew phrase, which means a resolved and diligent attention
   to a thing. The import of the line is, that they with full-bent purpose
   and activity corrupted all their doings.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 3:8

   8. Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise
   up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I
   may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all
   my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of
   my jealousy.

   8. Propterea expectate me, dicit Jehova, usque ad diem quo surgam ad
   praedam; quia judicium meum (hoc est, decretum est mihi,) ut colligam
   gentes, ut congregem regna; ut effundam super ipsa (regna, vel, super
   ipsas gentes) indignationem meam, totum furorem irae meae; quia igne
   zeli (vel, indignationis meae) vorabitur tota terra.


   God here declares that the last end was near, since he had found by
   experience that he effected nothing by long forbearance, and since he
   had even found the Jews becoming worse, because he had so mercifully
   treated them. Some think that the address is made to the faithful, that
   they might prepare themselves to bear the cross; but this view is
   foreign to the subject of the Prophet: and though this view has gained
   the consent of almost all, I yet doubt not but that the Prophet, as I
   have now stated, breaks out into a complaint, and says, that God would
   not now deal in words with a people so irreclaimable.

   Look for me, he says; that is, I am now present fully prepared: I have
   hitherto endeavored to turn you, but your hearts have become hardened
   in depravity. But inasmuch as I have lost all my labor in teaching,
   warning, and exhorting you, even when I presented to you examples on
   every side among heathen nations, which ought to have stimulated you to
   repentance, and inasmuch as I have effected nothing, it is now all over
   with you--Look for me: I shall no more contend with you, nor is there
   any ground for you to hope that I shall any more send Prophets to you.

   Look then for me, until I shall rise --for what purpose? to the prey.
   Some render the word ld, laod, forever; but the Prophet means, that God
   was so offended with the contumacy of the people, that he would now
   plunder, spoil and devour, and forget his kindness, which had been
   hitherto a sport to them--I shall come as a wild beast; as lions rage,
   lacerate, tear, and devour, so also will I now do with you; for I have
   hitherto too kindly and paternally spared you. We hence see that these
   things are not to be referred to the hope and patience of the godly;
   but that God on the contrary does here denounce final destruction on
   the wicked, as though he had said--I bid you adieu; begone, and mind
   your own concerns; for I will no longer contend with you; but I shall
   shortly come, and ye shall find me very different from what I have been
   to you hitherto. We now see that God, as it were, repudiates the Jews,
   and threatens that he would come to them with a drawn sword; and at the
   same time he compares himself to a savage and cruel wild beast.

   He afterwards adds--For my judgment is; that is, I have decreed to
   gather all nations. We have elsewhere spoken of this verb 'sph, asaph;
   it is the same in Hebrew as the French trousser. It is then my purpose
   to gather, that is, to heap together into one mass all nations, to
   assemble the kingdoms, so that no corner of the earth may escape my
   hand. But he speaks of all nations and kingdoms, that the Jews might
   understand that his judgment could no longer be deferred; for if a
   comparison be made between them and the heathen nations, judgment, as
   it is written, is wont to begin with the house of God, 1 Peter 4:17;
   and further, they were less excusable than the unbelieving, who went
   astray, which is nothing strange, in darkness, for they were without
   the light of truth. God then threatens nations and kingdoms, that the
   Jews might know that a most dreadful punishment was impending over
   their heads, for they had surpassed all others in wickedness and evil
   deeds. [113] He afterwards adds--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [113] This verse is considered by Newcome and Henderson to be addressed
   to the godly, to encourage them at the approaching calamities, while
   Piscator, Grotius, Marckius, and Dathius, agree with Calvin that it is
   an awful warning to the wicked Jews, spoken of in the preceding verse.
   Differing somewhat from Calvin, they regard the "nations" and
   "kingdoms" to be the Babylonians, who were composed of various nations
   and kingdoms, and "upon them" to be the Jews, and "the whole land" to
   be that of Judea. This view, no doubt, is the most consistent with the
   context. The objection made by Henderson, that the words expect, or
   wait for me, are ever used in a good sense, seems to have no force, for
   these words by themselves can mean neither what is good nor what is
   bad, the whole depends on the context. The verb [chkh] simply means to
   tarry, to wait--menein. The word "therefore" seems to connect this with
   the preceding verse, and there is nothing in the foregoing part of the
   chapter that alludes to the godly. Besides, the words which follow
   "wait for me" explain them, as will be seen by the following literal
   rendering of the whole verse-- 8. Therefore wait for me, saith Jehovah,
   For the day of my rising to the prey!
   For my purpose is to gather nations,
   To assemble kingdoms,
   In order to pour on them my indignation,
   All the heat of my anger;
   For by the fire of my jealousy
   Shall be consumed the whole land. The "fire of God's jealousy"
   sufficiently proves that what is meant is the land of Judea. (See
   chapter 1:18.)--Ed.

   Zephaniah 3:9

   9. For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may
   all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.

   9. Certe tunc convertam ad populos labium purum, ut invocent omnes
   nomen Jehovae, ut serviant ei humero uno.


   The Prophet now mitigates the asperity of his doctrine, which might
   have greatly terrified the godly; nay, it might have wholly
   disheartened them, had no consolation been applied. God then moderates
   here what he had previously threatened; for if the Prophet had only
   said this--My purpose is to gather all the nations, and thus the whole
   earth shall be devoured by the fire of indignation, what could the
   faithful have concluded but that they were to perish with the rest of
   the world? It was therefore necessary to add something to inspire hope,
   such as we find here.

   We must at the same time bear in mind what I have reminded you of
   elsewhere--that the Prophet directs his discourse one while to the
   faithful only, who were then few in number, and that at another time he
   addresses the multitude indiscriminately; and so when our Prophet
   threatens, he regards the whole body of the people; but when he
   proclaims the favor of God, it is the same as though he turned his eyes
   towards the faithful only, and gathered them into a place by
   themselves. As for instance, when a few among a people are really wise,
   and the whole multitude unite in hastening their own ruin, he who has
   an address to make will make a distinction between the vast multitude
   and the few; he will severely reprove those who are thus foolish, and
   live for their own misery; and he will afterwards shape his discourse
   so as to suit those with whom he has not so much fault to find. Thus
   also the Lord changes his discourse; for at one time he addresses the
   ungodly, and at another he turns to the elect, who were but a remnant.
   So the Prophet has hitherto spoken by reproofs and threatening, for he
   addressed the whole body of the people; but now he collects, as I have
   said, the remnant as it were by themselves, and sets before them the
   hope of pardon and of salvation.

   Hence he says, But then [114] (for I take ky, ki, as an adversative)
   will I turn to the people a pure lip. God intimates that he would
   propagate his grace wider, after having cleansed the earth; for he will
   be worshipped not only in Judea, but by foreign nations, and even by
   the remotest. For it might have been objected, Will God then extinguish
   his name in the world? For what will be the state of things when Judea
   is overthrown and other nations destroyed, except that God's name will
   be exposed to reproach! It will nowhere be invoked, and all will outvie
   one another in blasphemies against him. The Prophet meets this
   objection, and says, that God has in his own hand the means by which he
   will vindicate his own glory; for he will not only defend his Church in
   Judea, but will also gather into it nations far and wide, so that his
   name shall be everywhere celebrated.

   But he speaks first of a pure lip, I will turn, he says, to the nations
   a pure lip. By this word he means, that the invocation of God's name is
   his peculiar work; for men do not pray through the suggestion of the
   flesh, but when God draws them. It is indeed true, that God has ever
   been invoked by all nations; but it was not the right way of praying,
   when they heedlessly cast their petitions into the air: and we also
   know, that the true God was not invoked by the nations; for there was
   no nation then in the world which had not formed for itself some idol.
   As then the earth was full of innumerable idols, God was not invoked
   except in Judea only. Besides, though the unbelieving had an intention
   to pray to God, yet they could not have prayed rightly, for prayer
   flows from faith. God then does not without reason promise, that he
   would turn pure lips to the nations; that is, that he would cause the
   nations to call on his name with pure lips. We hence then learn what I
   have stated--that God cannot be rightly invoked by us, until he draws
   us to himself; for we have profane and impure lips. In short, the
   beginning of prayer is from that hidden cleansing of the Spirit of
   which the Prophet now speaks.

   But if it be God's singular gift, to turn a pure lip to the nations, it
   follows that faith is conferred on us by him, for both are connected
   together. As God then purifies the hearts of men by faith, so also he
   purifies their lips that his name may be rightly invoked, which would
   otherwise be profaned by the unbelieving. Whenever they pretend to call
   on God's name, it is certain that it is not done without profanation.

   As to the word all, it is to be referred to nations, not to each
   individual; for it has not been that every one has called on God; but
   there have been some of all nations, as Paul also says in the first
   chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians 1 Corinthians 1:1: for
   in addressing the faithful, he adds, With all who call on the name of
   the Lord in every place'--that is, not only in Judea; and elsewhere he
   says,

   I would that men would stretch forth hands to heaven in every place.'
   (1 Timothy 2:8.)

   He afterwards adds, That they may serve him with one shoulder; that is,
   that they may unitedly submit to God in order to do him service; for to
   serve him with the shoulder is to unite together, so as to help one
   another. The metaphor seems to have been derived from those who carry a
   burden; for except each assists, one will be overpowered, and then the
   burden will fall to the ground. We are said then to serve God with one
   shoulder when we strive by mutual consent to assist one another. And
   this ought to be carefully noticed, that we may know that our striving
   cannot be approved by God, except we have thus the same end in view,
   and seek also to add courage to others, and mutually to help one
   another. Unless then the faithful thus render mutual assistance, the
   Lord cannot approve of their service. [115]

   We now see how foolishly they talk who so much extol free-will and
   whatever is connected with it: for the Lord demands faith as well as
   other duties of religion; and he requires also from all, love and the
   keeping of the whole law. But he testifies here that his name cannot be
   invoked, as the lips of all are polluted, until he has consecrated
   them, cleansing by his Spirit what was before polluted: and he shows
   also that men will not undertake the yoke, unless he joins them
   together, so as to render them willing. I must not proceed farther.

   [114] [ky 'n], "For then," Henderson; "Surely then," Newcome; "Postea
   vero--but afterwards," Dathius and Grotius. And Newcome says, that ['n]
   is used here largely, for "afterwards." It refers to the time after the
   execution of the judgments previously mentioned. "The pure lip" is
   evidently not the language which God would adopt in addressing the
   nations, but the language they would adopt in addressing him. What is
   meant is a pure heart; what gives utterance to the heart is mentioned
   for the heart itself; as the "shoulder" is afterwards used for the
   service that is rendered to God. The verb [hphk], to turn, means to
   change the form, condition, or course of a thing, conveying perhaps
   here the idea, that the pure lip is substituted for that which is
   impure: "I will give them as a change, instead of what they have, a
   pure lip." Metastrepso--"I will change," Sept. and Sym.; strepso--"I
   will turn," Aq. and Theod. It is rendered "reddam" and "restituam" by
   Drusius and Grotius Newcome, following the conjecture of Houbigant,
   reads ['sphk], "I will pour out," contrary to all the ancient versions,
   and without the countenance of a single MS. Though the word, [mym],
   peoples, most frequently means the nations, yet there are instances in
   which it means the people of Israel, inasmuch as they were composed of
   various tribes. See 1 Kings 22:28; Joel 2:6. And if we render the verb,
   "restore," with Drusius and Grotius, then we must adopt this meaning.
   Eleven MSS. have "and," [v], before the verb to "serve:" and as there
   is no preposition before "shoulder," we may render the verse-- But I
   will then restore to the people a pure lip,
   That they may, all of them, call on the name of Jehovah, --
   And one shoulder, that they may serve him. --Ed.

   [115] The expression "with one shoulder" is rendered by the Septuagint,
   "under one yoke"--hupo zugon hena. The idea is that of oxen drawing
   together. To serve God under one yoke, is to do the same service
   unitedly. "A metaphor," says Newcome, "from the joint efforts of yoked
   beasts."--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that since it is the principal part of our
   happiness, that in our pilgrimage through this world there is open to
   us a familiar access to thee by faith,--O grant, that we may be able to
   come with a pure heart to thy presence: and when our lips are polluted,
   O purify us by thy Spirit, so that we may not only pray to thee with
   the mouth, but also prove that we do this sincerely, without any
   dissimulation, and that we earnestly seek to spend our whole life in
   glorifying thy name, until being at length gathered into thy celestial
   kingdom, we may be truly and really united to thee, and be made
   partakers of that glory, which has been procured for us by the blood of
   thy only-begotten Son. Amen.

   Zephaniah 3:10

   10. From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter
   of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.

   10. Trans fluvios Ethiopiae supplicantes mihi (vel, supplices mei;)
   filia dispersorum meorum offerent munus meum (hoc est, mihi; nam [y]
   affixum accipitur loco pronominis [yl'].)


   Interpreters agree not as to the meaning of this verse; for some of the
   Hebrews connect this with the former, as though the Prophet was still
   speaking of the calling of the Gentiles. But others, with whom I agree,
   apply this to the dispersed Jews, so that the Prophet here gives hope
   of that restoration, of which he had before spoken. They who understand
   this of the Gentiles, think that Atharai and Phorisai are proper names.
   But in the first place, we cannot find that any nations were so called;
   and then, if we receive what they say, these were not separate nations,
   but portions of the Ethiopians; for the Prophet does not state the fact
   by itself, that Atharai and Phorisai would be the worshipers of God;
   but after having spoken of Ethiopia, he adds these words: hence we
   conclude, that the Prophet means this,--that they would return into
   Judea from the farthest region of the Ethiopians to offer sacrifices to
   God. And as he mentions the daughter of the dispersion, we must
   understand this of the Jews, for it cannot be applied to the
   Ethiopians. And this promise fits in well with the former verse: for
   the Prophet spoke, according to what we observed yesterday, of the
   future calling of the Gentiles; and now he adds, the Jews would come
   with the Gentiles, that they might unite together, agreeing in the same
   faith, in the true and pure worship of the only true God. He had said,
   that the kingdom would be enlarged, for the Church was to be gathered
   from all nations: he now adds, that the elect people would be restored,
   after having been driven away into exile.

   Hence he says, Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia shall be my suppliants:
   for tr, otar, means to supplicate; but it means also sometimes to be
   pacified, or to be propitious; and therefore some take trym, otarim, in
   a passive sense, they who shall be reconciled to God; as though he had
   said, God will at length be propitious to the miserable exiles, though
   they have been cast away beyond the rivers of Ethiopia: they shall yet
   again be God's people, for he will be reconciled to them. As David
   calls Him the God of his mercy, because he had found him merciful and
   gracious, (Psalm 59:17,) so also in this place they think that the Jews
   are said to be the try, the reconciled of Jehovah, because he would be
   reconciled to them. But this exposition is too forced: I therefore
   retain that which I have stated,--that some suppliants would come to
   God from the utmost parts of Ethiopia, not the Ethiopians themselves,
   but the Jews who had been driven there.

   To the same purpose is what is added, The daughter of my dispersed; for
   phvph, puts, means to scatter or to disperse. [116] Hence by the
   daughter of the dispersed he means the gathered assembly of the
   miserable exiles, who for a time were considered as having lost their
   name, so as not to be counted as the people of Israel. These then shall
   again offer to me a gift, that is, they are to be restored to their
   country, that they may there worship me after their usual manner. Now
   though this prophecy extends to the time of the Gospel, it is yet no
   wonder, that the Prophet describes the worship of God such as it had
   been, accompanied with the ceremonies of the Law. We now then perceive
   what Zephaniah means in this verse,--that not only the Gentiles would
   come into the Church of God, but that the Jews also would return to
   their country, that they might together make one body. It follows,--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [116] It is more consonant with the style of the Prophets to render the
   clauses apart, as Calvin does, than as it is done in our version, and
   by Newcome and Henderson. The auxiliary verb, as is often the case, is
   to be understood in the first clause,-- From beyond the rivers of Cush
   shall be my suppliants;
   The daughter of my dispersed shall bring my offering.

   Zephaniah 3:11

   11. In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein
   thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the
   midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be
   haughty because of my holy mountain.

   11. In die illo non erubesces ob omnia facta tua, quibus praevaricata
   es contra me; quia tunc auferam e medio tui qui exultant superbia tua;
   et non adijicies ad superbiendum posthac (hoc est, non adjicies
   superbire) in monte sanctitatis meae.


   Here the Prophet teaches us, that the Church would be different, when
   God removed the dross and gathered to himself a pure and chosen people:
   and the Prophet stated this, that the faithful might not think it hard
   that God so diminished his Church that hardly the tenth part remained;
   for it was a sad and a bitter thing, that of a vast multitude a very
   few only remained. It could not then be, but that the ruin of their
   brethren greatly affected the Jews, though they knew them to be
   reprobate. We indeed see how Paul felt a sympathy, when he saw that his
   own nation were alienated from God. Romans 9:6-8. So it was necessary
   that some consolation should be given to the faithful, that they might
   patiently bear the diminution of the Church, which had been previously
   predicted. Hence the Prophet, that he might moderate their grief, says,
   that this would be for their good; for in this manner the reproaches
   were to be removed, by which the Jewish name had been polluted, and
   rendered abominable.

   Thou shalt not be ashamed, he says, for the sins by which I have been
   offended. Why? For thou shalt be cleansed; for it is God's purpose to
   reserve a few, by whom he will be purely worshipped. Some think that he
   does not speak here of the remission of sins, but on the contrary, of a
   pure and holy life, which follows regeneration; as though he had said,
   "There will be no reason any more for thee to be ashamed of thy life;
   for when I shall chasten you, ye will then fear me, and your correction
   will be conducive to a newness of life: since then your life will not
   be the same as formerly, and since my glory shall shine forth among
   you, there will be no cause why ye should be ashamed." But this is a
   strained view, and cannot be accommodated to the words of the Prophet;
   for he says, Thou shalt no more be ashamed of the sins by which thou
   hast transgressed against me. We hence see that this cannot be
   otherwise applied than to the remission of sins. But the last clause
   has led interpreters astray, for the Prophet adds, For I will take away
   from the midst of thee those who exult: but the Prophet's design, as I
   have stated, was different from what they have supposed; for he shows
   that there was no reason for the Jews to lament and deplore the
   diminution of the Church because the best compensation was offered to
   them, which was, that by this small number God would be purely served.
   For when the body of the people was complete, it was, we know, a mass
   of iniquity. How then could Israel glory in its vast number, since they
   were all like the giants carrying on war against God? When now God
   collects a few only, these few would at length acknowledge that they
   had been preserved in a wonderful manner, in order that religion and
   the true worship of God should not be extinguished in the earth.

   We now perceive the Prophet's design; but I will endeavor to render
   this clearer by a comparison: Suppose that in a city licentiousness of
   life so prevails that the people may seem to be irreclaimable; when it
   happens that the city itself falls away from its power and pristine
   state, or is in some other way reformed, not without loss, and is thus
   led to improve its morals, this would be a compensation to the good,
   and would give courage to the godly and ease their grief, so that they
   would patiently submit, though the city had not the same abundance, nor
   the same wealth and enjoyments. How so? because they who remained would
   form a body of people free from reproach and disgrace. When disease is
   removed from the human body, the body itself is necessarily weakened;
   and it is sometimes necessary to amputate a member, that the whole body
   may be preserved. In this case there is a grievous diminution, but as
   there is no other way of preserving the body, the remedy ought to be
   patiently sustained. In a similar manner does the Prophet now speak of
   the city Jerusalem: Thou shalt not be ashamed of the sins by which thou
   hast transgressed against me. How so? Because they were to be separated
   from the profane and gross despisers of God; for as long as the good
   and the evil were mixed together, it was a reproach common to all.
   Jerusalem was then a den of robbers; it was, as it were, a hell on
   earth; and all were alike exposed to the same infamy, for the pure part
   could not be distinguished, as a mass of evil prevailed everywhere. The
   Prophet now says, Thou shalt not be ashamed of thy former infamy. Why?
   "Because God will separate the chaff from the wheat, and will gather
   the wheat; ye shall be, as it were, in the storehouse of God; the
   chosen seed shall alone remain; there will be such purity, that the
   glory of the Lord shall shine forth among you: ye shall not therefore
   be ashamed of the disgraceful deeds by which ye are now contaminated."

   We now apprehend the meaning of the words. But it may seem strange that
   the Prophet should say, that sins should be covered by oblivion, which
   the Jews ought indeed to have thought of often and almost at all times,
   according to what Ezekiel says,

   Thou wilt then remember thy ways, and be ashamed,'
   (Ezekiel 16:61)

   that is, when God shall be pacified. Ezekiel says, that the fruit of
   repentance would be, that the faithful, covered with shame, would
   condemn themselves. Why so? Because the reprobate proceed in their
   wicked courses, as it were, with closed eyes, and as it has been
   previously said, they know no shame: though God charges them with their
   sins, they yet despise and reject every warning with a shameless front;
   yea, they kick against the goads. Since it is so, justly does Ezekiel
   say, that shame would be the fruit of true repentance, according to
   what Paul also says in the sixth chapter to the Romans (Romans 6:21),
   "Of which ye are now ashamed." He intimates, that when they were sunk
   in their unbelief, they were so given to shameful deeds, that they
   perceived not their abomination. They began therefore to be ashamed,
   when they became illuminated. The Prophet seems now to cut off this
   fruit from repentance: but what he says ought to be otherwise
   understood, that is, that the Church would be then free from reproach;
   for the reprobate would be separated, all the filth would be taken
   away, when God gathered only the remnant for himself; for in this
   manner, as it has been said, the wheat would be separated from the
   chaff. Thou shalt not then be ashamed in that day of evil deeds; for I
   will take away from the midst of thee those who exult. He shows how
   necessary the diminution would be; for all must have perished, had not
   God cut off the putrid members. How severe soever then and full of pain
   the remedy would be, it ought yet to be deemed tolerable; for the
   Church, that is the body, could not otherwise be preserved.

   But it may be again objected--That the Church is cleansed from all
   spots, inasmuch as the reprobate are taken away; for he says, Thou
   shalt not be ashamed of the evil deeds by which thou hast sinned,
   literally, against me, that is, by which thou hast transgressed against
   me. God here addresses, it may be said, the faithful themselves: He
   then does not speak of the evil deeds of those whom the Lord had
   rejected. But the answer is easy: When he says, that the Church had
   sinned, he refers to that mixture, by which no distinction is made
   between the wheat and the chaff. We may say that a city is impious and
   wicked, when the majority so much exceeds in number the good, that they
   do not appear. When therefore among ten thousand men there are only
   thirty or even a smaller number who are anxious for a better state of
   things, the whole number will be generally counted wicked on account of
   the larger portion, for the others are hid, and, as it were, covered
   over and buried. Justly then and correctly does Zephaniah declare, that
   the Jews had transgressed against God; for in that mixed multitude the
   elect could not have been distinguished from the reprobate. But he now
   promises that there would be a distinction, when God took away the
   proud, who exulted in vain boasting. For he says, I will take away from
   the midst of thee those who exult in thy pride

   Some render the word in the abstract, the exultations of thy pride: but
   the term lyzym, found here, is never in construction rendered
   exultations. It is therefore no doubt to be understood of men. He then
   names the pride of the people; and yet he addresses the elect, who were
   afterwards to be gathered. What does this mean? even what we have
   already stated, that before the Church was cleansed from her pollution
   and filth, there was a common exultation and insolence against God; for
   these words were everywhere heard--

   "We are God's holy people,
   we are a chosen race,
   we are a royal priesthood,
   we are a holy inheritance."
   Exodous 19:6.

   Since, then, these boastings were in the mouth of them all, the Prophet
   says, that it was the pride of the whole people. I will then take away,
   he says, from the midst of thee those who exult in thy pride [117]

   He afterwards adds, Thou shalt no more add to take pride in my holy
   mountain. Here the Prophet points out the main spring of the evil,
   because the Jews had hardened themselves in a perverse self-confidence,
   as they thought that all things were lawful for them, inasmuch as they
   were God's chosen people. Jeremiah also in a similar manner represents
   their boasting as false, when they pretended to be the temple of God.
   Jeremiah 7:4. So our Prophet condemns this pride, because they
   concealed their sins under the shadow of the temple, and thought it a
   sufficient defense, that God dwelt on Mount Sion. To show, then, that
   the people were unhealable, without being cleansed from this pride, the
   Prophet says, I will take away those who exult --How did they exult? in
   thy pride: and what was this pride? that they inhabited the holy mount
   of God, besides which there was no other sanctuary of God on earth. As
   then they imagined that God was thus bound to them, they insolently
   despised all admonitions, as though they were exempt from every law and
   restraint. Thou shalt not then add to take pride in my holy mountain

   We now then see how careful we ought to be, lest the favors of God,
   which ought by their brightness to guide us to heaven, should darken
   our minds. But as we are extremely prone to arrogance and pride, we
   ought carefully to seek to conduct ourselves in a meek and humble
   manner, when favored with God's singular benefits; for when we begin
   falsely to glory in God's name, and to put on an empty mask to cover
   our sins, it is all over with us; inasmuch as to our wickedness, to our
   contempt of God, and to other evil lusts and passions, there is added
   perverseness, for we persevere in our course, as it were, with an iron
   and inflexible neck. Thus, indeed, it happens to all hypocrites, who
   elate themselves through false pretenses as to their connection with
   God. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [117] This may be rendered, "Those who exult in thy exaltation:" the
   Targum has it, "in thy glory." This "glory" or "exaltation," as
   explained in the next verse, was Mount Sion. There was a preeminence,
   but it was made an object of unholy boasting. The paraphrase of
   Henderson, "thy proud exulters," completely leaves out the character of
   their exultation. The whole verse may be thus rendered,-- In that day
   thou shalt not be ashamed of thy doings,
   By which thou hast transgressed against me;
   For then will I remove from the midst of thee
   Those who exult in thy exaltation;
   And thou shalt no more be elevated
   On account of the mount of my holiness. The word [g'vt] means
   exaltation or glory in a good as well as in a bad sense. See Psalm
   93:1; Isaiah 12:5. What they exulted in was in itself good, but they
   exulted only in an outward privilege, without connecting it with God,
   as many have done in all ages. This is the essence of Pharisaism.
   Vatables and Drusius regard the word as having this sense here.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 3:12, 13

   12. I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
   people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord.

   12. Et residuum faciam in medio tui populum afflictum et pauperem; et
   sperabunt in nomine Iehovae.

   13. The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies;
   neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they
   shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

   13. Residuum Israel non perpetrabunt iniquitatem (hoc est, reliquae; ad
   verbum est, residuum; sed quia nomen est collectivum, ideo mutatur
   numerus,) et non loquentur mendacium, et non invenietur in ore ipsorum
   lingua dolosa (vel, lingua fraudis;) quoniam ipsi pascentur et
   accubabunt; et nemo erit exterrens.


   Here the Prophet pursues the same subject--that God would provide for
   the safety of his Church, by cutting off the majority of the people,
   and by reserving a few; for his purpose was to gather for himself a
   pure and holy Church, as the city had previously been full of all
   uncleanness. It ought, then, to have been a compensation to ease their
   grief, when the godly saw that God would be propitious to them, though
   he had treated them with great severity. And we must bear in mind what
   I have before stated--that the Church could not have been preserved
   without correcting and subduing that arrogance, which arose from a
   false profession as to God. Zephaniah takes it now as granted, that
   pride could not be torn away from their hearts, except they were wholly
   cast down, and thus made contrite. He then teaches us, that as long as
   they remained whole, they were ever proud, and that hence it was
   necessary to apply a violent remedy, that they might learn meekness and
   humility; which he intimates when he says, that the residue of the
   people would be humble and afflicted; for if they had become willingly
   teachable, there would have been no need of so severe a correction. In
   short, though the faithful lament that God should thus almost
   annihilate his Church, yet in order that they might not murmur, he
   shows that this was a necessary remedy. How so? because they would have
   always conducted themselves arrogantly against God, had they not been
   afflicted. It was, therefore, needful for them to be in a manner
   broken, because they could not be bent. I will, then, he says, make the
   residue an afflicted and a poor people

   The word, ny, oni, means humble; but as he adds the word dl, dal, he no
   doubt shows that the Jews could not be corrected without being stripped
   of all the materials of their glorying. [118] They were, indeed,
   extremely wedded to their boastings; yea, they were become hardened in
   their contempt of God. He therefore says, that this fruit would at last
   follow, that they would trust in the Lord, that is, when he had laid
   them prostrate.

   This verse contains a most useful instruction: for first we are taught
   that the Church is subdued by the cross, that she may know her pride,
   which is so innate and so fixed in the hearts of men, that it cannot be
   removed, except the Lord, so to speak, roots it out by force. There is
   then no wonder that the faithful are so much humbled be the Lord, and
   that the lot of the Church is so contemptible; for if they had more
   vigor, they would soon, as is often the case, break out into an
   insolent spirit. That the Lord, then, may keep his elect under
   restraint, he subdues and tames them by poverty. In short, he exercises
   them under the cross. This is one thing.

   We must also notice the latter clause, when he says, They shall trust
   in the Lord, that is, those who have been reduced to poverty and want.
   We hence see for what purpose God deprives us of all earthly trust, and
   takes away from us every ground of glorying; it is, that we may rely
   only on his favor. This dependence ought not, indeed, to be extorted
   from us, for what can be more desirable than to trust in God? But while
   men arrogate to themselves more than what is right, and thus put
   themselves in the place of God, they cannot really and sincerely trust
   in him. They indeed imagine that they trust in God, when they ascribe
   to him a part of their salvation; but except this be done wholly, no
   trust can be placed in God. It is hence necessary that they who ascribe
   to themselves even the smallest thing, should be reduced to nothing:
   and this is what the Prophet means. Let us further know, that men do
   not profit under God's scourges, except they wholly deny themselves,
   and forget their own power, which they falsely imagine, and recomb on
   him alone.

   But the Prophet speaks of the elect alone; for we see that many are
   severely afflicted, and are not softened, nor do they put off their
   former hardihood. But the Lord so chastises his people, that by the
   spirit of meekness he corrects in them all pride and haughtiness. But
   by saying, They shall trust in the name of Jehovah, he sets this trust
   in contrast with the pride which he had previously condemned. They
   indeed wished to appear to trust in the name of God, when they boasted
   of Mount Sion, and haughtily brought forward the adoption by which they
   had been separated from heathen nations; but it was a false boasting,
   which had no trust in it. To trust, then, in the name of Jehovah is
   nothing else than sincerely to embrace the favor which he offers in his
   word, and not to make vain pretenses, but to call on him with a pure
   heart and with a deep feeling of penitence.

   For the same purpose he adds, The residue of Israel shall no more work
   iniquity nor speak falsehood; nor shall there be found a deceitful
   tongue in their mouth. The Prophet continues the same subject--that the
   Church is not to be less esteemed when it consists only of a few men;
   for in the vast number there was great filth, which not only polluted
   the earth by its ill savor, but infected heaven itself. Since then
   Jerusalem was full of iniquities, as long as the people remained
   entire, the Prophet adduces this comfort, that there was no reason for
   sorrow, if from a vast number as the sand of the sea, and from a great
   multitude like the stars, God would only collect a small band; for by
   this means the Church would be cleansed. And it was of great importance
   that the filth should be cleansed from God's sanctuary; for what could
   have been more disgraceful than that the holy place should be made the
   lodging of swine, and that the place which God designed to be
   consecrated to himself, should be profaned? As then Jerusalem was the
   sanctuary of God, ought not true religion to have flourished there? But
   when it became polluted with every kind of filth, the Prophet shows
   that it ought not to have seemed grievous that the Lord should take
   away that vast multitude which falsely boasted that they professed his
   name. They shall not then work iniquity

   Under one kind of expression he includes the whole of a righteous life,
   when he says, They shall not speak falsely, nor will there be found a
   deceitful tongue. It is indeed sufficient for the practice of piety or
   integrity of life to keep the tongue free from frauds and falsehood;
   but as it cannot be that any one will abstain from all frauds and
   falsehood, except he purely and from the heart fears God, the Prophet,
   by including the whole under one thing, expresses under the word tongue
   what embraces complete holiness of life.

   It may be now asked, whether this has ever been fulfilled. It is indeed
   certain, that though few returned to their own country, there were yet
   many hypocrites among that small number; for as soon as the people
   reached their own land, every one, as we find, was so bent on his own
   advantages, that they polluted themselves with heathen connections,
   that they neglected the building of the temple, and deprived the
   priests of their tenths, that they became cold in the worship of God.
   With these things they were charged by Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.
   Since these things were so, what means this promise, that there would
   be no iniquity when God had cleansed his Church? The Prophet speaks
   comparatively; for the Lord would so cleanse away the spots from his
   people that their holiness would then appear more pure. Though then
   many hypocrites were still mixed with the good and real children of
   God, it was yet true that iniquity was not so prevalent, that frauds
   and falsehood were not so rampant among the people as they were before.

   He afterwards adds, For they shall feed and lie down, and there will be
   none to terrify them. He mentions another benefit from God--that he
   will protect his people from all wrongs when they had repented. We must
   ever bear in mind what I have stated--that the Prophet intended here to
   heal the sorrow of the godly, which might have otherwise wholly
   dejected their minds. That he might then in some measure alleviate the
   grief of God's children, he brings forward this argument--"Though few
   shall remain, it is yet well that the Lord will cleanse away the filth
   of the holy city, that it may be justly deemed to be God's habitation,
   which was before the den of thieves. It is not then a loss to you, that
   few will dwell in the holy land, for God will be a faithful guardian of
   your safety. What need then is there of a large multitude, except to
   render you safe from enemies and from wild beasts? What does it
   signify, if God receives you under his protection, under the condition
   that ye shall be secure, though not able to resist your enemies? Though
   one cannot defend another, yet if God be your protector, and ye be made
   to live in peace under the defense which he promises, there is no
   reason why ye should say, that you have suffered a great loss, when
   your great number was made small. It is then enough for you to live
   under God's guardianship; for though the whole world were united
   against you, and ye had no strength nor defense yourselves, yet the
   Lord can preserve you; there will be no one to terrify you

   And this argument is taken from the law; for it is mentioned among
   other blessings, that God would render safe the life of his people;
   which is an invaluable blessing, and without which the life of men, we
   know, must be miserable; for nothing is more distressing than constant
   fear, and nothing is more conducive to happiness than a quiet life: and
   hence to live in quietness and free from all fear, is what the Lord
   promises as a chief blessing to his people.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [118] The first word, [ky], means one made humble by distress or
   affliction, the humbled, rather than the humble. The second word, [dl],
   is one exhausted, or reduced in number, or reduced to poverty. Newcome
   renders it "lowly," but improperly. Jerome has "pauperem et
   egenum--poor and needy;" the Septuagint, "praun kai tapeinon--meek and
   humble;" Marckius, "afflictum et attenuatum--afflicted and diminished."
   Perhaps the best rendering would be, "a people humbled and reduced."
   The idea of being "afflicted" or distressed, is excluded by what is
   expressed at the end of the next verse, and also that of being "poor"
   in a worldly respect. The reference seems to be to a humbled state of
   mind, occasioned by calamities, and to a reduced number--a remnant. "I
   will leave" for [hs'rty], as in our version, is not its full meaning.
   It means to reserve as a remnant. "I will cause to remain," or, "I will
   reserve," would be the proper rendering.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that since the depravity of our nature is so
   great, that we cannot bear prosperity without some wantonness of the
   flesh immediately raging in us, and without becoming even arrogant
   against thee,--O grant, that we may profit under the trials of the
   cross; and when thou have blest us, may we with lowly hearts,
   renouncing our perverseness, submit ourselves to thee, and not only
   bear thy yoke submissively, but proceed in this obedience all our life,
   and so contend against all temptations as never to glory in ourselves,
   and feel also convinced, that all true and real glory is laid up for us
   in thee, until we shall enjoy it in thy celestial kingdom, through
   Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Zephaniah 3:14, 15

   14. Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with
   all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

   14. Exulta filia Sion (vel, jubila; exulta Israel; gaude et exulta toto
   corde filia Ierjusalem.

   15. The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine
   enemy: the king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee: thou
   shalt not see evil any more.

   15. Abstulit Iehova judicia tua, purgando avertit inimicos tuos; rex
   Israel Iehova in medio tui; non videbis malum amplius.


   The Prophet confirms what he has been teaching, and encourages the
   faithful to rejoice, as though he saw with his eyes what he had
   previously promised. For thus the Prophets, while encouraging the
   faithful to entertain hope, stimulate them to testify their gratitude,
   as though God's favor was already enjoyed. It is certain, that this
   instruction was set before the Jews for this purpose,--that in their
   exile and extreme distress they might yet prepare themselves to give
   thanks to God, as though they were already, as they say, in possession
   of what they had prayed for. But we must remember the design of our
   Prophet, and the common mode of proceeding which all the Prophets
   followed; for the faithful are exhorted to praise God the same as if
   they had already enjoyed his blessings, which yet were remote, and
   seemed concealed from their view.

   We now then perceive what the Prophet meant in encouraging the Jews to
   praise God: he indeed congratulates them as though they were already
   enjoying that happiness, which was yet far distant: but as it is a
   congratulation only, we must also bear in mind, that God deals so
   bountifully with his Church as to stimulate the faithful to gratitude;
   for we pollute all his benefits, except we return for them, as it has
   been stated elsewhere, the sacrifice of praise: and as a confirmation
   of this is the repetition found here, which would have otherwise
   appeared superfluous. "Exult, daughter of Sion, shout, be glad; rejoice
   with all thine heart, daughter of Jerusalem." [119]

   But the Prophet was not thus earnest without reason; for he saw how
   difficult it was to console the afflicted, especially when God
   manifested no evidence of hope according to the perception of the
   flesh; but his purpose was by this heap of words to fortify them, that
   they might with more alacrity struggle with so many hard and severe
   trials.

   He then adds, that God had taken away the judgments of Zion. By
   judgments, he means those punishments which would have been inflicted
   if it had been the Lord's purpose to deal according to strict justice
   with the Jews, as when any one says in our language, J'ai brule tous
   tes proces. He intimates then that God would no more make an enquiry as
   to the sins of his people. The word mspht, meshiphath, we know, has
   various meanings in Hebrew; but in this place, as I have said, it means
   what we call in French, Toutes procedures. In short, God declares that
   the sins of his people are buried, so that he in a manner cuts off his
   character as a judge, and remits his own right, so that he will no more
   contend with the Jews, or summon them, as they say, to trial. Jehovah
   then will take away thy judgments [120]

   Then follows an explanation, By clearing he has turned aside all
   enemies; [121] for we know that war is one of God's judgments. As then
   God had punished the Jews by the Assyrians, by the Egyptians, by the
   Chaldeans, and by other heathen nations, he says now, that all enemies
   would be turned away. It hence follows, that neither the Assyrians nor
   the Chaldeans had assailed them merely through their own inclination,
   but that they were, according to what has been elsewhere stated, the
   swords, as it were, of God.

   It afterwards follows, The king of Israel is Jehovah in the midst of
   thee. Here the Prophet briefly shows, that the sum of real and true
   happiness is then possessed, when God declares, that he undertakes the
   care of his people. God is said to be in the midst of us, when he
   testifies that we live under his guardianship and protection. Properly
   speaking, he never forsakes his own; but these forms of speech, we
   know, are to be referred to the perception of the flesh. When the Lord
   is said to be afar off, or to dwell in the midst of us, it is to be
   understood with reference to our ideas: for we think God to be then
   absent when he gives liberty to our enemies, and we seem to be exposed
   as a prey to them; but God is said to dwell in the midst of us when he
   protects us by his power, and turns aside all assaults. Thus, then, our
   Prophet now says, that God will be in the midst of his Church; for he
   would really and effectually prove that he is the guardian of his elect
   people. He had been indeed for a time absent, when his people were
   deprived of all help, according to what Moses expresses when he says,
   that the people had deluded themselves, because they had renounced God,
   by whose hand they had been safely protected, and were also to be
   protected to the end. Exodus 32:25

   He lastly adds, Thou shalt not see evil. Some read, "Thou shalt not
   fear evil," by inserting y, iod; but the meaning is the same: for the
   verb, to see, in Hebrew is, we know, often to be taken in the sense of
   finding or experiencing. Thou shalt then see no evil; that is, God will
   cause thee to live in quietness, free from every disturbance. If the
   other reading, Thou shalt not fear evil, be preferred, then the
   reference is to the blessing promised in the law; for nothing is more
   desirable than peace and tranquillity. Since then this is the chief of
   temporal blessings, the Prophet does not without reason say, that the
   Church would be exempt from all fear and anxiety, when God should dwell
   in the midst of it, according to what he says in Psalm 46:1. It now
   follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [119] To give the words their specific meaning, they may be thus
   rendered,-- Cry aloud thou daughter of Zion,
   Shout ye Israel;
   Rejoice and exult with all thine heart,
   Thou daughter of Jerusalem. The first two lines encourage the fullest
   expression of feelings, loud crying, and shouting like a trumpet; and
   then is set forth the character of these feelings; they were to be
   those of job and exultation. Our version, Newcome and Henderson, render
   the second line correctly, but not the first; and "Be glad and rejoice"
   are too feeble to express what the third line contains: for the
   exhortation is to "rejoice" and to "exult." It was to be the loud cry
   of joy, and the shouting of exultation or triumph.--Ed.

   [120] Turned aside hath Jehovah thy judgments.--Ed.

   [121] The words are, [phnh 'yvk], "he hath turned away thine enemy."
   Many copies have ['yvyk], "thine enemies;" but it may be regarded as
   the poetical singular.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 3:16, 17

   16. In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to
   Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.

   16. In die illa dicitur Jerosolymae, Ne timeas; Sion, ne pigrescant
   (vel, solvantur, name [hphr] significat lentum esse, vel, remissum,
   vel, dissolutum; ne ergo pigrescant) manus tuae.

   17. The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he
   will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy
   over thee with singing.

   17. Iehova Deus tuus in medio tui fortis servabit; exultabit (vel,
   gaudebit) super te in laetitia; quiescet (silebit ad verbum, vel,
   quietus erit) in amore suo; exultabit super te cum jubilatione.


   The Prophet proceeds still to confirm the same truth, but employs a
   different mode of speaking. It shall, he says, be then said everywhere
   to Zion, Fear not, let not thine hands be let down, etc. For these
   words may no less suitably be applied to the common report or applause
   of all men, then to the prophetic declaration; so that the expression,
   It shall be said, may be the common congratulation, which all would vie
   to offer. The import of the whole is, that Jerusalem would be so
   tranquil that either the Prophets, or all with common consent would
   say, "Thou enjoyest thy rest: for God really shows that he cares for
   thee; there is therefore no cause for thee hereafter to fear." For
   there is expressed here a real change: since the Jews had been before
   in daily fear, the Prophet intimates, that they would be so safe from
   every danger, as to be partakers of the long-wished-for rest, with the
   approbation even of the whole world. Hence, it shall be said--by whom?
   either by the Prophets, or by common report: it makes no great
   difference, whether there would be teachers to announce their state
   joyful and prosperous, or whether all men would, by common consent,
   applaud God's favor, when he had removed from his people all wars,
   troubles, and fears, so as to make them live in quietness.

   It shall then be said to Jerusalem, fear not; Sion! let not thine hands
   be relaxed. By saying Fear not, and let not thine hands be relaxed, he
   intimates, that all vigor is so relaxed by fear, that no member can
   perform its function. But by taking a part for the whole, he
   understands by the word hands, every other part of the body; for by the
   hands men perform their works. Hence in Scripture the hands often
   signify the works of men. The meaning then is--that God's Church would
   then be in such a state of quietness as to be able to discharge all its
   duties and transact its concerns peaceably and orderly. And it is what
   we also know by experience, that when fear prevails in our hearts we
   are as it were lifeless, so that we cannot raise even a finger to do
   anything: but when hope animates us, there is a vigor in the whole
   body, so that alacrity appears everywhere. The Prophet, no doubt, means
   here, that God thus succors his elect, not that they may indulge in
   pleasures, as is too often the case, but that they may, on the
   contrary, strenuously devote themselves to the performance of their
   duties. We ought therefore to notice the connection between a tranquil
   state and diligent hands; for, as I have said, God does not free us
   from all trouble and fear, that we may grow torpid in our pleasures,
   but that we may, on the contrary, be more attentive to our duty. Sion,
   then! let thine hands be no more torpid --Why?

   Jehovah, he says, in the midst of thee strong, will save. He repeats
   what he had said, but more fully expresses what might have appeared
   obscure on account of its brevity. He therefore shows here more at
   large the benefit of God's presence--that God will not dwell idly in
   his Church, but will be accompanied with his power. For what end? To
   save. We hence see that the word gvvr, gebur, ascribed to God, is very
   emphatical; as though he had said, that God would not be idle while
   residing in the midst of his Church, but would become its evident
   strength. And it is worthy of notice, that God exhibits not himself as
   strong that he may terrify his elect, but only that he may become their
   preserver.

   He afterwards adds, He will rejoice over thee with gladness. This must
   be referred to the gratuitous love of God, by which he embraces and
   cherishes his Church, as a husband his wife whom he most tenderly
   loves. Such feelings, we know, belong not to God; but this mode of
   speaking, which often occurs in Scripture, is thus to be understood by
   us; for as God cannot otherwise show his favor towards us and the
   greatness of his love, he compares himself to a husband, and us to a
   wife. He means in short--that God is most highly pleased when he can
   show himself kind to his Church.

   He confirms and shows again the same thing more clearly, He will be at
   rest (or silent) in his love. The proper meaning of chrs, charesh, is
   to be silent, but it means here to be at rest. The import is, that God
   will be satisfied, as we say in French, Il prendra tout son
   contentement; as though he had said that God wished nothing more than
   sweetly and quietly to cherish his Church. As I have already said, this
   feeling is indeed ascribed to God with no strict correctness; for we
   know that he can instantly accomplish whatever it pleases him: but he
   assumes the character of men; for except he thus speaks familiarly with
   us, he cannot fully show how much he loves us. God then shall be at
   rest in his love; that is, "It will be his great delight, it will be
   the chief pleasure of thy God when he cherishes thee: as when one
   cherishes a wife most dear to him, so God will then rest in his love."
   He then says, He will exult over thee with joy [122]

   These hyperbolic terms seem indeed to set forth something inconsistent,
   for what can be more alien to God's glory than to exult like man when
   influenced by joy arising from love? It seems then that the very nature
   of God repudiates these modes of speaking, and the Prophet appears as
   though he had removed God from his celestial throne to the earth. A
   heathen poet says,--

   Not well do agree, nor dwell on the same throne,
   Majesty and love. (Ovid. Met. Lib. 2: 816-7.)

   God indeed represents himself here as a husband, who burns with the
   greatest love towards his wife; and this does not seem, as we have
   said, to be suitable to his glory; but whatever tends to this end--to
   convince us of God's ineffable love towards us, so that we may rest in
   it, and being weaned as it were from the world, may seek this one thing
   only, that he may confer on us his favor--whatever tends to this,
   doubtless illustrates the glory of God, and derogates nothing from his
   nature. We at the same time see that God, as it were, humbles himself;
   for if it be asked whether these things are suitable to the nature of
   God, we must say, that nothing is more alien to it. It may then appear
   by no means congruous, that God should be described by us as a husband
   who burns with love to his wife: but we hence more fully learn, as I
   have already said, how great is God's favor towards us, who thus
   humbles himself for our sake, and in a manner transforms himself, while
   he puts on the character of another. Let every one of us come home also
   to himself, and acknowledge how deep is the root of unbelief; for God
   cannot provide for our good and correct this evil, to which we are all
   subject, without departing as it were from himself, that he might come
   nigher to us.

   And whenever we meet with this mode of speaking, we ought especially to
   remember, that it is not without reason that God labors so much to
   persuade us of his love, because we are not only prone by nature to
   unbelief, but exposed to the deceits of Satan, and are also inconstant
   and easily drawn away from his word: hence it is that he assumes the
   character of man. We must, at the same time, observe what I have before
   stated--that whatever is calculated to set forth the love of God, does
   not derogate from his glory; for his chief glory is that vast and
   ineffable goodness by which he has once embraced us, and which he will
   show us to the end.

   What the Prophet says of that day is to be extended to the whole
   kingdom of Christ. He indeed speaks of the deliverance of the people;
   but we must ever bear in mind what I have already stated--that it is
   not one year, or a few years, which are intended, when the Prophets
   speak of future redemption; for the time which is now mentioned began
   when the people were restored from the Babylonian captivity, and
   continues its course to the final advent of Christ. And hence also we
   learn that these hyperbolic expressions are not extravagant, when the
   Prophets say, Thou shalt not afterwards fear, nor see evil: for if we
   regard the dispersion of that people, doubtless no trial, however
   heavy, can happen to us, which is not moderate, when we compare our lot
   with the state of the ancient people; for the land of Canaan was then
   the only pledge of God's favor and love. When, therefore, the Jews were
   ejected from their inheritance, it was, as we have said elsewhere, a
   sort of repudiation; it was the same as if a father were to eject from
   his house a son, and to repudiate him. Christ was not as yet manifested
   to the world. The miserable Jews had an evidence, in figures and
   shadows, of that future favor which was afterwards manifested by the
   gospel. Since, then, God gave them so small an evidence of his love,
   how could it be otherwise but that they must have fainted, when driven
   far away from their land? Though the Church is now scattered and torn,
   and seems little short of being ruined, yet God is ever present with us
   in his only-begotten Son: we have also the gate of the celestial
   kingdom fully opened. There is, therefore, administered to us at all
   times more abundant reasons for joy than formerly to the ancient
   people, especially when they seemed to have been rejected by God. This
   is the reason why the Prophet says, that the Church would be lessened
   by calamities, when God again gathered it. But that redemption of the
   people of Israel ought at this day to be borne in mind by us; for it
   was a memorable work of God, by which he intended to afford a perpetual
   testimony that he is the deliverer of all those who hope in him. It
   follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [122] This is a very remarkable passage. Perhaps the more literal
   version would be the following,-- 16. In that day he will say to
   Jerusalem, "Fear thou not;
   Sion! relaxed let not thy hands be: 17. He will rejoice over thee with
   joy;
   He will renew thee in his love,
   He will exult over thee with acclamation." The verb [y'mr] is rendered
   as above by the Septuagint, erei, meaning the Lord. The last line but
   one is according to the Septuagint and the Syriac; and this sense has
   been adopted by Houbigant, Dathius, and Newcome. There is the
   difference only of one letter, [d] for [r], which are very alike. The
   law of parallelism is in favor of this meaning. The verse contains four
   lines: there is an evident correspondence of meaning in the second and
   the last line; and so there is between the first and the third
   according to the preceding version, but not otherwise. The word
   rendered "acclamation" is a noun from the verb [rkh], to cry aloud,
   used at the beginning of verse 14.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 3:18

   18. I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who
   are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.

   18. Afflictos a tempore (vel, pro tempore, vel, ad tempus, ut alii
   vertunt) congregabo qui ex te erunt: onus (vertunt quidam, sed active
   accipere Propheta potius, qui sistinuerunt ergo) super eam opprobrium.


   He proceeds here with the same subject, but in different words; for
   except some consolation had been introduced, what the Prophet has
   hitherto said would have been frigid; for he had promised them joy, he
   had exhorted the chosen of God to offer praise and thanksgiving; but
   they were at the same time in a most miserable state. It was hence
   necessary to add this declaration respecting the exiles being gathered.

   But he says at the time. Some read, in respect to time; but this is
   obscure and strained. Others render it, at the time; but it means
   strictly from the time; though m, mem, may sometimes be rendered as a
   particle of comparison. Interpreters do not seem to me rightly to
   understand the Prophet's meaning: for I do not doubt but that he points
   out here the fixed time of deliverance, as though he had said, I will
   again gather thine afflicted, and those who have endured thy reproach.
   When? at the time, mmvd, memuod; that is, at the determined or fixed
   time: for mvd, muod, is not taken in Hebrew for time simply, but for a
   predetermined time, as we say in French, Un terme prefix I will then
   gather thine afflicted, but not soon. Our Prophet then holds the
   faithful here somewhat in suspense, that they might continue in their
   watch tower, and patiently wait for God's help; for we know how great
   is our haste, and how we run headlong when we hope for anything; but
   this celerity, according to the old proverb, is often delay to us.
   Since, then, men are always carried away by a certain heat, or by too
   much impetuosity, to lay hold on what may happen, the Prophet here lays
   a restraint, and intimates that God has his own seasons to fulfill what
   he has promised, that he will not do so soon, nor according to the will
   of men, but when the suitable time shall come. And this time is that
   which he has appointed, not what we desire.

   He then adds, Who have sustained reproach for her. In this second
   clause the Prophet no doubt repeats the same thing; but at the same
   time he points out, not without reason, their condition--that the Jews
   suffered reproach and contumely at the time of their exile, and that on
   account of being the Church; that is, because they professed to worship
   their own God; for on account of his name the Jews were hated by all
   nations, inasmuch as their religion was different from the
   superstitions of all heathens. It could not hence be, but that the
   unbelieving should vex them with many reproaches, when they were
   carried away into exile, and scattered in all directions. [123]

   He had said before, I will gather the afflicted; but he now adds, I
   will gather those who have sustained reproach. I have stated that some
   read, A burden upon her is reproach; but no sense can be elicited from
   such words. The Prophet does here no doubt obviate a temptation which
   awaited God's children, who would have to experience in exile what was
   most grievous to be borne; for they were to be exposed to the taunts
   and ridicule of all nations. Hence he seasonably heals their grief by
   saying, that though for a time they would be laughed at by the ungodly,
   they would yet return to their own country; for the Lord had resolved
   to gather them. But we must ever remember what I have said--that God
   would do this in his own time, when he thought it seasonable. It
   follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [123] This verse presents considerable difficulties, and has been
   variously rendered. The Septuagint and the Targum differ as much from
   one another, as they do from the Hebrew. None regard the former as at
   all suitable; but some, as Grotius and Dathius, take the meaning of the
   latter, though to reconcile it with the Hebrew is difficult. Marckius
   seems to have given the most probable meaning-- Remotos a festivitate
   collegi,
   Ex to sunt, onus super eam opprobrium. Those driven away from festivity
   have I gathered,
   From thee they are -- a burden on her is reproach. The word [nvgy], he
   derives from [hgh]. In this case it is literally, "my driven away," or,
   "my removed" ones. [mvd] is assembling or meeting, as well as a fixed
   time or season; and the assembling was that on festal days: it may
   therefore be rendered, "festivals." "From thee" is "Sion" in verse 16.
   Instead of "on her," more than ten copies, as well as the Targum, have
   "on thee," [lyk]; but an abrupt change of person is of frequent
   occurrence in the Prophets. Following the sense of the Targum, we may,
   perhaps, give the following version-- The grieved for the festivals
   have I gathered from thee;
   They were a burden on thee, a reproach. The paraphrase of the Targum,
   as given by Dathius, is the following-- Those who among thee have
   impeded the seasons of thy festivity,
   I will expel from thee; woe to them who have carried arms against thee,
   and loaded thee with reproaches. The "grieved for the festivals" were
   those who disliked them, who grudged the offerings that were to be
   made. The words are in the past tense, but future as to what is said;
   for the Prophets declare things as exhibited to them in a vision.--Ed.

   Zephaniah 3:19

   19. Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will
   save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will
   get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to
   shame.

   19. Ecce ego conficiens omnes oppressores tuos (qui te humiliant, ad
   verbum) in tempore illo; et servabo claudicantem, et reducam expulsam
   ad faciendum eos in laudem et nomen in terra opprobrii ipsorum.


   He confirms here what I have referred to in the last verse that God
   would overcome all obstacles, when his purpose was to restore his
   people. On this the Prophet, as we have said, dwells, that the Jews
   might in their exile sustain themselves with the hope of deliverance.
   As, then, they could not instantly conceive what was so incredible
   according to the perceptions of the flesh, he testifies that there is
   sufficient power in God to subdue all enemies.

   At that time, he says, he repeats what had been stated before--that his
   people must wait as long as God pleases to exercise them under the
   cross; for if their option had been given to the Jews, they would have
   willingly continued at their ease; and we know how men are wont to
   exempt themselves from every trouble, fear, and sorrow. As therefore
   men naturally desire rest and immunity from all evil, the Prophet here
   exhorts the faithful to patience, and shows, that it cannot be that God
   will become their deliverer, except they submit to his chastisement; at
   that time then. It is ever to be observed, that the Prophet condemns
   that extreme haste which usually takes hold of men when God chastises
   them. However slowly then and gradually God proceeds in the work of
   delivering his own, the Prophet shows here, that there was no reason
   for them to despair, or to be broken down in their spirits. [124]

   He then subjoins, that he would save the halting, and restore the
   driven away. By these words he means, that though the Church would be
   maimed and torn, there would yet be nothing that could hinder God to
   restore her: for by the halting and the driven away he understands none
   other than one so stripped of power as wholly to fail in himself. He
   therefore compares the Church of God to a person, who, with relaxed
   limbs, is nearly dead. Hence, when we are useless as to any work, what
   else is our life but a languor like to death? But the Prophet declares
   here, that the seasonable time would come when God would relieve his
   own people: though they were to become prostrate and fallen, though
   they were to be scattered here and there, like a torn body of man, an
   arm here and a leg there, every limb separated; yet he declares that
   nothing could possibly prevent God to gather his Church and restore it
   to its full vigor and strength. In short, he means that the restoration
   of the Church would be a kind of resurrection; for the Lord would
   humble his people until they became almost lifeless, so as not to be
   able to breathe: but he would at length gather them, and so gather them
   that they would not only breathe but be replenished with such new vigor
   as though they had received no loss. I cannot finish the whole today.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [124] The first clause in this verse is amended by Newcome and some
   other in conformity with the Septuagint: but this is a very unsafe
   process. Henderson's version is--Behold, I will deal with all thine
   oppressors at that time. "Deal," [sh]; "interficiam--I will slay,"
   Vulg.; "conficiam--I will make an end," Drusius; but to "deal with," or
   "act against," is the literal rendering. More is implied than what is
   expressed, which is often the case with words used in every
   language.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are at this day so scattered on account
   of our sins, and even they who seem to be collected in thy name and
   under thy authority, are yet so torn by mutual discords, that the
   safety of thy Church hangs as it were on a thread, while in the
   meantime thine enemies seem with savage cruelty to destroy all those
   who are thine, and to obliterate thy gospel,--O grant, that we may live
   in quietness and resignation, hoping in thy promises, so that we may
   not doubt, but that thou in due time will become our deliverer: and may
   we so patiently bear to be afflicted and cast down by thee, that we may
   ever raise up our groans to heaven so as to be heard through the name
   of thy Son, until being at length freed from every contest, we shall
   enjoy that blessed rest which is laid up for us in heaven, and which
   thine only begotten Son has procured for us. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Twenty-eighth

   We stopped yesterday at the latter clause of the last verse but one of
   the Prophet Zephaniah, where God promises that the Jews, who had been
   before not only obscure, but also exposed to all kinds of reproaches,
   would again become illustrious; for to give them for a name and for a
   praise, is no other thing than to render them celebrated, that they
   might be, as they say, in the mouth of every one.

   And he says, in the land of their shame, or reproach; for they had been
   a mockery everywhere; as the unbelieving thought that they deluded
   themselves with a vain hope, because they boasted that God, under whose
   protection they lived, would be their perpetual guardian, though they
   were driven away into exile. Hence an occasion for taunt and ridicule
   was given. But a change for the better is here promised; for all in
   Assyria and Chaldea would have to see that this was a people chosen by
   God; so that there would be a remarkable testimony among all nations,
   that all who trust in God are by no means disappointed, for they find
   that he is faithful in his promises. The last verse follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Zephaniah 3:20

   20. At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather
   you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the
   earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the
   LORD.

   20. In tempore illo reducam vos, in tempore illo colligam vos; quia
   ponam vos in nomen et laudem per cunctos populos terrae, (vel, inter
   cunctos populos terrae,) quam reducam captivitates vestras in oculis
   vestris, dicit Jehova.


   He repeats the same things, with some change in the words; and not
   without reason, because no one of them thought that the Jews, who were
   cast as it were into the grave, would ever come forth again, and
   especially, that they would be raised unto such dignity and unto so
   elevated an honor. As then this was not probable, that Prophet confirms
   his prediction--I will restore you, says God, I will gather you, even
   because I have given you a name; that is, it is my resolved and fixed
   purpose to render you celebrated: but here again are laid down the
   words we have already noticed.

   He afterwards adds--When I shall restore your captivities. The plural
   number is to be noticed; and not rightly nor prudently is what has been
   done by many interpreters, who have rendered the word in the singular
   number; for the Prophet mentions captivities designedly, as the Jews
   had not only been driven into exile, but had also been scattered
   through various countries, so that they were not one captive people,
   but many troops of captives. Hence his purpose was to obviate a doubt;
   for it would not have been enough that one captivity should be
   restored, except all who had been dispersed were collected into one
   body by the wonderful power of God. And hence he adds before your eyes,
   that the Jews might be convinced that they should be eye-witnesses of
   this miracle, which yet they could hardly conceive, without raising up
   their thoughts above the world.

   Calvin's Preface to Haggai

   After the return of the people, they were favored, we know, especially
   with three Prophets, who roused their fainting hearts, and finished all
   predictions, until at length the Redeemer came in his appointed time.
   During the time of The Babylonian Exile the office of teaching was
   discharged among the captives by Ezekiel, and also by Daniel; and there
   were others less celebrated; for we find that some of the Psalms were
   then composed, either by the Levites, or by some other teachers. But
   these two, Ezekiel and Daniel, were above all others eminent. Then Ezra
   and Nehemiah followed them, the authority of whom was great among the
   people; but we do not read that they were endued with the Prophetic
   gift.

   It then appears certain that three only were divinely inspired to
   proclaim the future condition of the people.

   Daniel had before them foretold whatever was to happen till the coming
   of Christ, and his Book is a remarkable mirror of God's Providence; for
   he paints, as on a tablet, three things which were to be fulfilled
   after his death, and of which no man could have formed any conjecture.
   He has given even the number of years from the return of the people to
   the building of the Temple, and also to the death of Christ. But we
   must come to the other witnesses, who confirmed the predictions of
   Daniel. The Lord raised up three witnesses--Haggai, Zechariah, and
   Malachi. [125]

   The first [126] condemned the sloth of the people; for, being intent on
   their own advantages, they all neglected the building of the Temple;
   and he shows that they were deservedly suffering punishment for their
   ingratitude; for they despised God their Deliverer, or at least honored
   him less than they ought to have done, and deprived him of the worship
   due to him. He then encouraged them to hope for a complete restoration,
   and showed that there was no reason for them to be disheartened by
   difficulties, and that though they were surrounded by enemies, and had
   to bear many evils, and were terrified by threatening edicts, they
   ought yet to have entertained hope; for the Lord would perform the work
   which he had begun--to restore their ancient dignity to his people, and
   Christ also would at length come to secure the perfect happiness and
   glory of the Church.

   This is the sum of the whole. I now come to the words.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [125] "Prophecy ceased with these Prophets until the time of Christ.
   For it was God's purpose, by this famine of the word, (according to the
   prophetic language,) to render the Jews more desirous (appetentiores)
   of the Messiah, who was to surpass all the Prophets in the power of
   doing miracles."--Grotius.

   [126] "We know nothing of the parentage of Haggai. He was probably born
   in Babylon during the captivity. He was sent particularly to encourage
   the Jews to proceed with the building of the temple, which had been
   interrupted for about fourteen years."--Adam Clarke.

   Chapter 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   Haggai 1:1

   1. In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the
   first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet
   unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua
   the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,

   1. Anno secundo Darii regis, mense sexto, die primo mensis, datus fuit
   sermo Jehovae in manum Chaggai Prophetae ad Zerubbabel, filium
   Sealtiel, ducem Jehudah, et ad Jehosuah, filium Jehosadak, sacerdotem
   magnum, dicendo--

   The Prophet mentions here the year, the month, and the day in which he
   began to rouse up the people from their sloth and idleness, by the
   command of God; for every one studied his own domestic interest, and
   had no concern for building the Temple.

   This happened, he says, in the second year of Darius the king.
   Interpreters differ as to this time; for they do not agree as to the
   day or year in which the Babylonian captivity began. Some date the
   beginning of the seventy years at the ruin which happened under
   Jeconiah, before the erasing of the city, and the destruction of the
   Temple. It is, however, probable, that a considerable time had passed
   before Haggai began his office as a Prophet; for Babylon was taken
   twenty years, or little more, before the death of king Cyrus; his son
   Cambyses, who reigned eight years, succeeded him. The third king was
   Darius, the son of Hystaspes, whom the Jews will have to be the son of
   Ahasuerus by Esther; but no credit is due to their fancies; for they
   hazard any bold notion in matters unknown, and assert anything that may
   come to their brains or to their mouths; and thus they deal in fables,
   and for the most part without any semblance of truth. It may be
   sufficient for us to understand, that this Darius was the son of
   Hystaspes, who succeeded Cambyses, (for I omit the seven months of the
   Magi; for as they crept in by deceit, so shortly after they were
   destroyed;) and it is probable that Cambyses, who was the first-born
   son of Cyrus, had no male heir. Hence it was that his brother being
   slain by the consent of the nobles, the kingdom came to Darius. He,
   then, as we may learn from histories, was the third king of the
   Persians. Daniel says, in the fifth chapter, that the city of Babylon
   had been taken by Cyrus, but that Darius the Mede reigned there.

   But between writers there is some disagreement on this point; though
   all say that Cyrus was king, yet Xenophon says, that Cyaxares was ever
   the first, so that Cyrus sustained only the character, as it were, of a
   regent. But Xenophon, as all who have any judgement, and are versed in
   history, well know, did not write a history, but fabled most boldly
   according to his own fancy; for he invents the tale that Cyrus was
   brought up by his maternal grandfather, Astyages. But it is evident
   enough that Astyages had been conquered in war by Cyrus. [127] He says
   also that Cyrus married a wife a considerable time after the taking of
   Babylon, and that she was presented to him by his uncle Cyaxares, but
   that he dared not to marry her until he returned to Persia, and his
   father Cambyses approved of the marriage. Here Xenophon fables, and
   gives range to his own invention, for it was not his purpose to write a
   history. He is a very fine writer, it is true; but the unlearned are
   much mistaken who think that he has collected all the histories of the
   world. Xenophon is a highly approved philosopher, but not an approved
   historian; for it was his designed object fictitiously to relate as
   real facts what seemed to him most suitable. He fables that Cyrus died
   in his bed, and dictated a long will, and spoke as a philosopher in his
   retirement; but Cyrus, we know, died in the Scythian war, and was slain
   by the queen, Tomyris, who revenged the death of her son; and this is
   well known even by children. Xenophon, however, as he wished to paint
   the image of a perfect prince, says that Cyrus died in his bed. We
   cannot then collect from the Cyropaeda, which Xenophon has written,
   anything that is true. But if we compare the historians together, we
   shall find the following things asserted almost unanimously:--That
   Cambyses was the son of Cyrus; that when he suspected his younger
   brother he gave orders to put him to death; that both died without any
   male issue; and that on discovering the fraud of the Magi, [128] the
   son of Hystaspes became the third king of the Persian. Daniel calls
   Darius, who reigned in Babylon, the Mede; but he is Cyaxares. This I
   readily admit; for he reigned by sufferance, as Cyrus willingly
   declined the honor. And Cyrus, though a grandson of Astyages, by his
   daughter Mandane, was yet born of a father not ennobled; for Astyages,
   having dreamt that all Asia would be covered by what proceeded from his
   daughter, was easily induced to marry her to a stranger. When,
   therefore, he gave her to Cambyses, his design was to drive her to a
   far country, so that no one born of her should come to so great an
   empire: this was the advice of the Magi. Cyrus then acquired a name and
   reputation, no doubt, only by his own efforts; nor did he venture at
   first to take the name of a king, but suffered his uncle, and at the
   same time his father-in-law, to reign with him; and yet he was his
   colleague only for two years; for Cyasares lived no longer than the
   taking of Babylon.

   I come then now to our Prophet: he says, In the second year of Darius
   it was commanded to me by the Lord to reprove the sloth of the people.
   We may readily conclude that more than twenty years had elapsed since
   the people began to return to their own country. [129] Some say thirty
   or forty years, and others go beyond that number; but this is not
   probable. Some say that the Jews returned to their country in the
   fifty-eighth year of their captivity; but this is not true, and may be
   easily disproved by the words of Daniel as well as by the history of
   Ezra. Daniel says in the ninth chapter Daniel 9:1 that he was reminded
   by God of the return of the people when the time prescribed by Jeremiah
   was drawing nigh. And as this happened not in the first year of Darius,
   the son of Hystaspes, but about the end of the reign of Belshasar
   before Babylon was taken, it follows that the time of the exile was
   then fulfilled. We have also this at the beginning of the history, When
   seventy years were accomplished, God roused the spirit of Cyrus the
   king.' We hence see that Cyrus had not allowed the free return of the
   people but at the time predicted by Jeremiah, and according to what
   Isaiah had previously taught, that Cyrus, before he was born, had been
   chosen for this work: and then God began openly to show how truly he
   had spoken before the people were driven into exile. But if we grant
   that the people returned in the fifty-eighth year, the truth of
   prophecy will not appear. They therefore speak very thoughtlessly who
   say that the Jews returned to their country before the seventieth year;
   for thus they subvert, as I have said, every notion of God's favor.

   Since then seventy years had elapsed when Babylon was taken, and Cyrus
   by a public edict permitted the Jews to return to their country, God at
   that time stretched forth his hand in behalf of the miserable exiles;
   but troubles did afterwards arise to them from their neighbors. Some
   under the guise of friendship wished to join them, in order to
   obliterate the name of Israel; and that they might make a sort of
   amalgamation of many nations. Then others openly carried on war with
   them; and when Cyrus was with his army in Scythia, his prefects became
   hostile to the Jews, and thus a delay was effected. Then followed
   Cambyses, a most cruel enemy to the Church of God. Hence the building
   of the Temple could not be proceeded with until the time of this
   Darius, the son of Hystaspes. But as Darius, the son of Hystaspes,
   favored the Jews, or at least was pacified towards them, he restrained
   the neighboring nations from causing any more delay as to the building
   of the Temple. He ordered his prefects to protect the people of Israel,
   so that they might live quietly in their country and finish the Temple,
   which had only been begun. And we may hence conclude that the Temple
   was built in forty-six years, according to what is said in the second
   chapter of John [130] (John 2:20); for the foundations were laid
   immediately on the return of the people, but the work was either
   neglected or hindered by enemies.

   But as liberty to build the Temple was given to the Jews, we may gather
   from what our Prophet says, that they were guilty of ingratitude
   towards God; for private benefit was by every one almost exclusively
   regarded, and there was hardly any concern for the worship of God.
   Hence the Prophet now reproves this indifference, allied as it was with
   ungodliness: for what could be more base than to enjoy the country and
   the inheritance which God had formerly promised to Abraham, and yet to
   make no account of God, nor of that special favor which he wished to
   confer--that of dwelling among them? An habitation on mount Sion had
   been chosen, we know, by God, that thence might come forth the Redeemer
   of the world. As then this business was neglected, and each one built
   his own house, justly does the Prophet here reprove them with vehemence
   in the name and by the command of God. Thus much as to the time. And he
   says in the second year of Darius, for a year had now elapsed since
   liberty to build the Temple had been allowed them; but the Jews were
   negligent, because they were too much devoted to their own private
   advantages.

   And he says, that the word was given by his hand to Zerubbabel, the son
   of Shealtiel, and to Joshua, the son of Josedech. We shall hereafter
   see that this communication had a regard without distinction to the
   whole community; and, if a probable conjecture be entertained, neither
   Zerubbabel nor Joshua were at fault, because the Temple was neglected;
   nay, we may with certainty conclude from what Zechariah says, that
   Zerubbabel was a wise prince, and that Joshua faithfully discharged his
   office as a priest. Since then both spent their labor for God, how was
   it that the Prophet addressed them? and since the whole blame belonged
   to the people, why did he not speak to them? why did he not assemble
   the whole multitude? The Lord, no doubt, intended to connect Zerubbabel
   and Joshua with his servant as associates, that they three might go
   forth to the people, and deliver with one mouth what God had committed
   to his servant Haggai. This then is the reason why the Prophet says,
   that he was sent to Zerubbabel and Joshua.

   Let us at the same time learn, that princes and those to whom God has
   committed the care of governing his Church, never so faithfully perform
   their office, nor discharge their duties so courageously and
   strenuously, but that they stand in need of being roused, and, as it
   were, stimulated by many goads. I have already said, that in other
   places Zerubbabel and Joshua are commended; yet the Lord reproved them
   and severely expostulated with them, because they neglected the
   building of the Temple. This was done, that they might confirm by their
   authority what the Prophet was about to say: but he also intimates,
   that they were not wholly free from blame, while the people were thus
   negligent in pursuing the work of building the Temple.

   Zerubbabel is called the son of Shealtiel: some think that son is put
   here for grandson, and that his father's name was passed over. But this
   seems not probable. They quote from the Chronicles a passage in which
   his father's name is said to be Pedaiah: but we know that it was often
   the case among that people, that a person had two names. I therefore
   regard Zerubbabel to have been the son of Shealtiel. He is said to have
   been the governor [131] of Judah; for it was necessary that some
   governing power should continue in that tribe, though the royal
   authority was taken away, and all sovereignty and supreme power
   extinguished. It was yet God's purpose that some vestiges of power
   should remain, according to what had been predicted by the patriarch
   Jacob,

   Taken away shall not be the scepter from Judah, nor a leader from his
   thigh, until he shall come;' etc. (Genesis 49:10.)

   The royal scepter was indeed taken away, and the crown was removed,
   according to what Ezekiel had said, Take away the crown, subvert,
   subvert, subvert it,' (Ezekiel 21:26, 27;) for the interruption of the
   government had been sufficiently long. Yet the Lord in the meantime
   preserved some remnants, that the Jews might know that that promise was
   not wholly forgotten. This then is the reason why the son of Shealtiel
   is said to be the governor of Judah. It now follows--

   [127] According to the opinions of Plato and Cicero, the Cyropaedia of

   [128] The account of the Magi is briefly this:--Cyrus had two sons,
   Cambyses and Smerdis. When Cambyses ascended the throne, suspecting the
   fidelity of his brother, he caused him to be secretly put to death.
   This was known to some of the Magi. On the death of Cambyses, one of
   them, named Smerdis, who resembled the deceased prince, was by the Magi
   declared king, under the pretense of being the brother of Cambyses. The
   imposition was detected, and seven of the nobles of Persia dethroned
   him after six months' reign, and on themselves, Darius Hystaspes, was
   made king, in the year before Christ 521.--Ed.

   return from Babylon.--Ed.

   [130] The reference in John 2:19,20, seems to have been made not to the
   time in which it was built then, but to the time in which it was built
   or rebuilt by Herod the Great. For this temple was finished in the
   sixth year of Darius (see Ezra 6:15,) and about twenty-one years after
   the temple was finished in 515. It was about four years in building
   under Darius.--Ed.

   Syn. render it hegoumenon, governor. He is called Sheshbazzar in Ezra
   5:14; and Cyrus is said to have made him [phchh], governor or deputy.
   It is the name of a person endued with authority by a sovereign.
   Zerubbabel, [zrvvl], has been derived from [zr], a stranger, and [vvn],
   Babylon, a stranger or sojourner at Babylon. It deserves to be noticed,
   that the civil governor is put here before the chief priest; and we
   find from Ezra that it was to the civil governor that Cyrus delivered
   the holy vessels of the temple. See Ezra 5:14.--Ed.

   Haggai 1:2-4

   2. Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, This people say, The time
   is not come, the time that the Lord's house should be built.

   2. Sic dicit Iehova exercituum, dicendo, Populus isti dicunt (hoc est,
   dicit,) Non venit tempus domui Iehovae ad aedificandum.

   3. Then came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet, saying,

   3. Et datus fui sermo Iehovae in manu Chaggai Prophetae, dicendo,

   4. Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this
   house lie waste?

   4. An tempus vobis, ut habitatis vos in domibus vestris tabulatis, et
   domus haec deserta?

   They who think that seventy years had not passed until the reign of
   Darius, may from this passage be easily disproved: for if the seventy
   years were not accomplished, an excuse would have been ready at
   hand,--that they had deferred the work of building the Temple; but it
   was certain, that the time had then elapsed, and that it was owing to
   their indifference that the Temple was not erected, for all the
   materials were appropriated to private uses. While then they were thus
   taking care of themselves and consulting their own interest, the
   building of the Temple was neglected. That the Temple was not built
   till the reign of Darius, this happened, as we have said, from another
   cause, because the prefects of king Cyrus gave much annoyance to the
   Jews, and Cambyses was most hostile to them. But when liberty was
   restored to them, and Darius had so kindly permitted them to build the
   Temple, they had no excuse for delay.

   It is however probable that they had then many disputes as to the time;
   for it may have been, that they seizing on any pretext to cover their
   sloth, made this objection,--that many difficulties had occurred,
   because they had been too precipitate, and that they had thus been
   punished for their haste, because they had rashly undertaken the
   building of the Temple: and we may also suppose that they took another
   view of the time as having not yet come, for easily might this
   objection occur to them,--"It is indeed true that the worship of God is
   deservedly to be preferred to all other things; but the Lord grants us
   this indulgence, so that we are allowed to build our own houses; and in
   the meantime we attend to the sacrifices. Have not our fathers lived
   many ages without a Temple? God was then satisfied with a sanctuary:
   there is now an altar erected, and there sacrifices are offered. The
   Lord then will forgive us if we defer the building of the Temple to a
   suitable time. But in the meantime every one may build his own house,
   so that afterwards the Temple may at leisure be built more
   sumptuously." However this may have been, we find that true which I
   have often stated,--that the Jews were so taken up with their own
   domestic concerns, with their own ease, and with their own pleasures,
   that they made very little account of God's worship. This is the reason
   why the Prophet was so greatly displeased with them.

   He declares what they said, This people say, The time is not yet come
   to build the house of Jehovah [132] He repeats here what the Jews were
   wont to allege in order to disguise their sloth, after having delayed a
   long time, and when they could not, except through consummate
   effrontery, adduce anything in their own defense. We however see, that
   they hesitated not to promise pardon to themselves. Thus also do men
   indulge themselves in their sins, as though they could make an
   agreement with God and pacify him with some frivolous things. We see
   that this was the case then. But we may also see here, as in a mirror,
   how great is the ingratitude of men. The kindness of God had been
   especially worthy of being remembered, the glory of which ought to have
   been borne in mind to the end of time: they had been restored from
   exile in a manner beyond what they had ever expected. What ought they
   to have done, but to have devoted themselves entirely to the service of
   their deliverer? But they built, no, not even a tent for God, and
   sacrificed in the open air; and thus they wilfully trifled with God.
   But at the same time they dwelt at ease in houses elegantly fitted up.

   And how is the case at this day? We see that through a remarkable
   miracle of God the gospel has shone forth in our time, and we have
   emerged, as it were, from the abodes below. Who does now rear up, of
   his own free-will, an altar to God? On the contrary, all regard what is
   advantageous only to themselves; and while they are occupied with their
   own concerns, the worship of God is cast aside; there is no care, no
   zeal, no concern for it; nay, what is worse, many make gain of the
   gospel, as though it were a lucrative business. No wonder then, if the
   people have so basely disregarded their deliverance, and have almost
   obliterated the memory of it. No less shameful is the example witnessed
   at this day among us.

   But we may hence also see how kindly God has provided for his Church;
   for his purpose was that this reproof should continue extant, that he
   might at this day stimulate us, and excite our fear as well as our
   shame. For we also thus grow frigid in promoting the worship of God,
   whenever we are led to seek only our own advantages. We may also add,
   that as God's temple is spiritual, our fault is the more atrocious when
   we become thus slothful; since God does not bid us to collect either
   wood, or stones, or cement, but to build a celestial temple, in which
   he may be truly worshipped. When therefore we become thus indifferent,
   as that people were thus severely reproved, doubtless our sloth is much
   more detestable. We now see that the Prophet not only spoke to men of
   his age, but was also destined, through God's wonderful purpose, to be
   a preacher to us, so that his doctrine sounds at this day in our ears,
   and reproves our torpor and ungrateful indifference: for the building
   of the spiritual temple is deferred, whenever we become devoted to
   ourselves, and regard only what is advantageous to us individually. We
   shall go on with what follows tomorrow.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we must carry on a warfare in this world,
   and as it is thy will to try us with many contests,--O grant, that we
   may never faint, however extreme may be the trials which we shall have
   to endure: and as thou hast favored us with so great an honor as to
   make us the framers and builders of thy spiritual temple, may every one
   of us present and consecrate himself wholly to thee: and, inasmuch as
   each of us has received some peculiar gift, may we strive to employ it
   in building this temple, so that thou mayest be worshipped among us
   perpetually; and especially, may each of us offer himself wholly as a
   spiritual sacrifice to thee, until we shall at length be renewed in
   thine image, and be received into a full participation of that glory,
   which has been attained for us by the blood of thy only-begotten Son.
   Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Twenty-ninth

   When the Prophet asks, whether the time had come for the Jews to dwell
   in splendid and well furnished houses, and whether the time had not
   come to build the Temple, he intimates, that they were trifling in a
   very gross manner with God; for there was exactly the same reason for
   building the Temple as for building the city. How came they to be
   restored to their country, but that God performed what he had testified
   by the mouth of Jeremiah? Hence their return depended on the redemption
   promised to them: it was therefore easy for them to conclude, that the
   time for building the Temple had already come; for the one could not,
   and ought not to have been separated from the other, as it has been
   stated. He therefore upbraids them with ingratitude, for they sought to
   enjoy the kindness of God, and at the same time disregarded the
   memorial of it.

   And very emphatical are the words, when he says, Is it time for you to
   dwell in houses? [133] For there is implied a comparison between God,
   whose Temple they set no value on, and themselves, who sought not only
   commodious, but sumptuous dwellings. Hence the Prophet inquires,
   whether it was consistent that mortal men, who differ not from worms,
   should possess magnificent houses, and that God should be without his
   Temple. And to the same purpose is what he adds, when he says, that
   their houses were boarded; for sphvnym, saphunim, means in Hebrew what
   we express by Cambrisees [134] Since then they were not satisfied with
   what was commodious, without splendor and luxury being added, it was
   extremely shameful for them to rob God at the same time of his Temple,
   where he was to be worshipped. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [133] There is a double pronoun, [ht lkm 'tm], "Is it time for you,
   even you," or, "you yourselves?" The Welsh often use two pronouns in
   this way, for the sake of emphasis. The rendering is very flat, as in
   our version, and adopted by Henderson, "Is it time for you, O ye?" etc.
   Houbigant, who always amends, proposes ['th], to come, "Is the time
   come for you?" etc. This is suitable, but without authority. Dathius
   suggests the place, but it is no more than a conjecture. There is no
   doubt an emphasis is intended by the repetition.--Ed.

   [134] It is rendered "wainscoted" by Henderson;
   "koilostathmois--ceiled," by the Sept.; "orophomenois--roofed," by
   Aquila. It was the custom in the east, says Parkhurst, to cover or line
   the roof with boards or wainscot.--Ed.

   Haggai 1:5, 6

   5. Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

   5. Et nunc sic dicit Iehova exercituum, Adjicite cor vestrum ad vias
   vestras;

   6. Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not
   enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but
   there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it
   into a bag with holes.

   6. Seminastis multum, et intulistis parum; comedere, et non ad
   satietatem; bibere, et non ad ebrietatem; vestire, et non ad calorem
   cuique; et qui colligit mercedem, colligit mercedem in sacculum
   perforatum.

   Here the Prophet deals with the refractory people according to what
   their character required; for as to those who are teachable and
   obedient, a word is enough for them; but they who are perversely
   addicted to their sins must be more sharply urged, as the Prophet does
   here; for he brings before the Jews the punishments by which they had
   been already visited. It is commonly said, that experience is the
   teacher of fools; and the Prophet has this in view in these words,
   apply your hearts to your ways; [135] that is, "If the authority of God
   or a regard for him is of no importance among you, at least consider
   how God deals with you. How comes it that ye are famished, that both
   heaven and earth deny food to you? Besides, though ye consume much
   food, it yet does not satisfy you. In a word, how is it that all things
   fade away and vanish in your hands? How is this? Ye cannot otherwise
   account for it, but that God is displeased with you. If then ye will
   not of your own accord obey God's word, let these judgements at least
   induce you to repent." It was to apply the heart to their ways, when
   they acknowledged that they were thus famished, not by chance, but that
   the curse of God urged them, or was suspended over their heads. He
   therefore bids them to receive instruction from the events themselves,
   or from what they were experiencing; and by these words the Prophet
   more sharply teaches them; as though he had said, that they profited
   nothing by instruction and warning, and that it remained as the last
   thing, that they were to be drawn by force while the Lord was
   chastising them.

   He says that they had sown much, and that small was the produce. They
   who render the clause in the future tense, wrest the meaning of the
   Prophet: for why did he say, apply your heart to your ways, if he only
   denounced a future punishment? But, as I have already stated, he
   intimates, that they very thoughtlessly champed the bridle, for they
   perceived not that all their evils were inflicted by God's hand, nor
   did they regard his judgement as righteous. Hence he says, that they
   had sowed much, and that the harvest had been small; and then, that
   they ate and were not satisfied; that they drank and had not their
   thirst quenched; that they clothed themselves and were not warmed. How
   much soever they applied those things which seemed necessary for the
   support of life, they yet availed them nothing. And God, we know, does
   punish men in these two ways either by withdrawing his blessings, by
   rendering the earth and and the heavens dry; or by making the abundant
   produce unsatisfying and even useless. It often happens that men gather
   what is sufficient for support, and yet they are always hungry. It is a
   kind of curse, which appears very evident when God takes away their
   nourishing power from bread and wine, so that they supply no support to
   man. When therefore fruit, and whatever the earth produces for the
   necessities of man, give no support, God proves, as it were by an
   outstretched arm, that he is an avenger. But the other curse is more
   frequent; that is, when God smites the earth with drought, so that it
   produces nothing. But our Prophet refers to both these kinds of evils.
   Behold, he says, Ye have sown much and ye gather little; and then he
   says, Though ye are supplied with the produce of wine and corn, yet
   with eating and drinking ye cannot satisfy yourselves; nay, your very
   clothes do not make you warm. They might have had a sure hope of the
   greatest abundance, had they not broken off the stream of God's favor
   by their sins. Were they not then extremely blind this experience must
   have awakened them, according to what is said in the first chapter of
   Joel.

   He says at the end of the verse, He who gains wages, gains then for a
   perforated bag. By these words he reminds them, that the vengeance of
   God could not only be seen in the sterility of the earth, and in the
   very hunger of men, who by eating were not satisfied; but also in their
   work, for they wearied themselves much without any profit, as even the
   money cast into the bag disappeared. Hence he says, even your work is
   in vain. It was indeed a most manifest proof of God's wrath, when their
   money, though laid up, yet vanished away. [136]

   We now see what the Prophet means: As his doctrine appeared frigid to
   the Jews and his warnings were despised, he treats them according to
   the perverseness of their disposition. Hence he shows, that though they
   disregarded God and his Prophets, they were yet sufficiently taught by
   his judgements, and that still they remained indifferent. He therefore
   goads them, as though they were asses, that they might at length
   acknowledge that God was justly displeased with them, and that his
   wrath was conspicuous in the sterility of the land, as well as in
   everything connected with their life; for whether they did eat or
   abstained from food, they were hungry; and when they diligently labored
   and gathered wages, their wages vanished, as though they had cast them
   into a perforated bag. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [135] Literally it is, "Set your heart on your ways." An idiomatic
   phrase, but very expressive. They were to fix their attention on their
   conduct, not merely to take a glance, but seriously and steadily to
   reflect on their ways.

   [136] There seems to be an irregularity in the construction of the
   whole verse. Literally it is as follows-- Ye have sown much, but the
   coming in is little;
   There is eating, but not to satisfaction;
   They drink, but not to fullness;
   There is clothing, but there is no warmth in it;
   And earn does the earner for a perforated bag. This change in the mode
   of construction takes away the monotony which would have otherwise
   appeared. The word [hv'], ['kvl], and [lvvs], are not infinitives, as
   some suppose, but participles used as nouns; which is often the case in
   Hebrew, as well as in Welsh, and often too in English, such as
   teaching, drinking, clothing, etc.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Haggai 1:7, 8

   7. Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways.

   7. Sic dicit Iehova exercituum, Ponite cor vestrum super vias vestras;

   8. Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I
   will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord.

   8. Ascendite in montem et afferte lignum, et aedificate domum (vel,
   hance domum;) et propitius ero in ea (vel, mihi placebit in ea;) et
   glorificabor, dicit Iehova.

   The Prophet now adds, that since the Jews were thus taught by their
   evils, nothing else remained for them but to prepare themselves without
   delay for the work of building the Temple; for they were not to defer
   the time, inasmuch as they were made to know, that God had come forth
   with an armed hand to vindicate his own right: for the sterility of
   which he had spoken, and also the famine and other signs of a curse,
   were like a drawn sword in the hand of God; by which it was evident,
   that he intended to punish the negligence of the people. As God then
   had been robbed of his right, he not only exhorted the people by his
   Prophets, but also executed his vengeance on this contempt.

   This is the reason why the Prophet now says, Apply your heart, and then
   adds, Go up to the mountain, bring wood, etc. And this passage
   strikingly sets forth why God punished their sins, in order that they
   might not only perceive that they had sinned, but that they might also
   seek to amend that which displeased God. We may also, in the second
   place, learn from what is said, how we are to proceed rightly in the
   course of true repentance. The beginning is, that our sins should
   become displeasing to us; but if any of us proceed no farther, it will
   be only an evanescent feeling: it is therefore necessary to advance to
   the second step; an amendment for the better ought to follow. The
   Prophet expresses both here: He says first, Lay your heart on your
   ways; that is, "Consider whence comes this famine to you, and then how
   it is that by laboring much ye gain nothing, except that God is angry
   with you." Now this was what wisdom required. But he again repeats the
   same thing, Lay your heart on your ways, that is, "Not only that sin
   may be hated by you, but also that this sloth, which has hitherto
   offended God and provoked his wrath, may be changed into strenuous
   activity." Hence he says, Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and
   let the house be built

   If any one is at a loss to know why the Prophet insists so much on
   building the Temple, the ready answer is this: that it was God's design
   to exercise in this way his ancient people in the duties of religion.
   Though then the Temple itself was of no great importance before God,
   yet the end was to be regarded; for the people were preserved by the
   visible Temple in the hope of the future Christ; and then it behaved
   them always to bear in mind the heavenly pattern, that they might
   worship God spiritually under the external symbols. It was not then
   without reason that God was offended with their neglect of the temple;
   for it hence clearly appeared, that there was no care nor zeal for
   religion among the Jews. It often was the case that they were more
   sedulous than necessary in external worship, and God scorned their
   assiduity, when not connected with a right inward feeling; but the
   gross contempt of God in disregarding even the external building, is
   what is reprehended here by the Prophet.

   He afterwards adds, And I will be propitious in it, or, I will take
   pleasure in it. Some read, It will please me; and they depart not from
   the real meaning of the verb: for rtsh, retse--is to be acceptable. But
   more correct, in my view, is the opinion of those who think that the
   Prophet alludes to the promise of God; for he had said, that he would
   on this condition dwell among the Jews, that he might hear their
   prayers, and be propitious to them. As, then, the Jews came to the
   Temple to expiate their sins, that they might return to God's favor, it
   is not without reason that God here declares that he would be
   propitious in that house.

   If any one sin,' said Solomon, and entering this house, shall humbly
   pray, do thou also hear from thy heavenly habitation.'
   (1 Kings 8:30.)

   We further know that the covering of the ark was called the
   propitiatory, because God there received the suppliant into favor. This
   meaning, then, seems the most suitable--that the Prophet says, that if
   the Temple was built, God would be there propitious. But it was a proof
   of extreme impiety to think that they could prosper while God was
   adverse to them: for whence could they hope for happiness, except from
   the only fountain of all blessings, that is, when God favored them and
   was propitious to them? And how could his favor be sought, except they
   came to his sanctuary, and thence raise up their minds by faith to
   heaven? When, therefore, there was no care for the Temple, it was easy
   to conclude that God himself was neglected, and regarded almost with
   scorn. We then see how emphatically this was added, I will be
   propitious there, that is, in the Temple; as though he had said, "Your
   infirmity ought to have reminded you that you have need of this help,
   even of worshipping me in the sanctuary. But as I gave you, as it were,
   a visible mirror of my presence among you, when I ordered a Temple to
   be built for me on mount Sion, when ye despise the Temple, is it not
   the same as though I was rejected by you?"

   He then adds, And I shall be glorified, saith Jehovah. He seems to
   express the reason why he should be propitious; for he would then see
   that his glory was regarded by the Jews. At the same time, this reason
   may be taken by itself, and this is what I prefer. [137] The Prophet
   then employs two goads to awaken the Jews: When the Temple was built,
   God would bless them; for they would have him pacified, and whenever
   they found him displeased, they might come as suppliants to seek
   pardon; this was one reason why it behaved them strenuously to
   undertake the building of the Temple. The second reason was, that God
   would be glorified. Now, what could have been more inconsistent than to
   disregard God their deliverer, and so late a deliverer too? But how God
   was glorified by the Temple I have already briefly explained; not that
   it added anything to God; but such ordinances of religion were then
   necessary, as the Jews were as yet like children. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [137] The whole verse may be thus rendered-- Ascend the mountains, for
   ye have brought wood;
   And build the house, that I may delight in it,
   That I may be glorified, saith Jehovah. The [v], vau, here in two
   instances may have the meaning of ut, that; but before [hv'tm], a verb
   in the perfect tense, it must be rendered "for," or, "as;" and the
   clause seems to be a parenthesis. The [v], vau, is not conversive when
   preceded by a verb in the imperative mood, as it appears from the end
   of the verse. The mount was not Libanus, as many have supposed, but
   Sion, where wood had been previously brought, but was not used. See
   Ezra 3:7. As to the verb [rtsh], followed by [v], it means to approve,
   to be pleased with, or to take pleasure or delight in, a thing. See 2
   Chronicles 29:3; Psalm 147:10; Micah 6:7. Probably the best rendering
   of the two last lines is the following-- And build the house, and I
   shall delight in it
   And render it glorious, saith Jehovah. To take the last verb in a
   causative sense is more consistent with the tenor of the passage. This
   is the meaning given by the Targum, and is adopted by Dathius.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Haggai 1:9

   9. Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought
   it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of
   mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.

   9. Respexistis ad multum, et ecce parum; et intulistis ad domum, et
   sufflavi in illud: cur hoc? dicit Iehova exercituum: Propter domum meam
   quae est deserta, et vos curritis (vel, addicti estis quisque domi
   suae) quisque in domum suam.

   Here the Prophet relates again, that the Jews were deprived of support,
   and that they in a manner pined away in their distress, because they
   robbed God of the worship due to him. He first repeats the fact, Ye
   have looked for much, but behold little [138] It may happen that one is
   contented with a very slender portion, because much is not expected.
   They who are satisfied with their own penury are not anxious though
   their portion of food is but scanty, though they are constrained to
   feed on acorns. Those who are become hardened in enduring evils, do not
   seek much; but they who desire much, are more touched and vexed by
   their penury. This is the reason why the Prophet says, Ye have looked
   for much, and, behold, there was but little; that is, "Ye are not like
   the peasants, who satisfy themselves with any sort of food, and are not
   troubled on account of their straitened circumstances; but your desire
   has led you to seek abundance. Hence ye seek and greedily lay hold on
   things on every side; but, behold, it comes to little."

   In the second place he adds, Ye have brought it home. He farther
   mentions another kind of evil--that when they gathered wine, and corn,
   and money, all these things immediately vanished. Ye have brought it
   home, and I have blown upon it. By saying that they brought it home, he
   intimates that what they had acquired was laid up, that it might be
   preserved safely; for they who had filled their storehouses, and
   wine-cellars, and bags, thought that they had no more to do with God.
   Hence it was that profane men securely indulged themselves; they
   thought that they were beyond the reach of danger, when their houses
   were well filled. God, on the contrary, shows that their houses became
   empty, when filled with treasures and provisions. But he speaks still
   more distinctly--that he had blown upon them, that is, that he had
   dissipated them by his breath: for the Prophet did not deem it enough
   historically to narrate what the Jews had experienced; but his purpose
   also was to point out the cause, as it were, by the finger. He
   therefore teaches us, that what they laid in store in their houses did
   not without a cause vanish away; but that this happened through the
   blowing of God, even because he cursed their blessing, according to
   what we shall hereafter see in the Prophet Malachi.

   He then adds, Why is this? saith Jehovah of hosts. God here asks, not
   because he had any doubts on the subject, but that he might by this
   sort of goading rouse the Jews from their lethargy,--"Think of the
   cause, and know that my hand is not guided by a blind impulse when it
   strikes you. You ought, then, to consider the reason why all things
   thus decay and perish." Here again is sharply reproved the stupidity of
   the people, because they attended not to the cause of their evils; for
   they ought to have known this of themselves.

   But God gives the answer, because he saw that they remained
   stupefied--On account of my house, he says, because it is waste [139]
   God here assigns the cause; he shows that though no one of them
   considered why they were so famished, the judgement of his curse was
   yet sufficiently manifest, on account of the Temple remaining a waste.
   And you, he says, run, every one to his own house. Some read, You take
   delight, every one in his own house; for it is the verb rtsh, retse,
   which we have lately noticed; and it means either to take pleasure in a
   thing, or to run. Every one, then, runs to his house, or, Every one
   delights in his house. But it is more suitable to the context to give
   this rendering, Every one runs to his house. For the Prophet here
   reminds the Jews that they were slow and slothful in the work of
   building the Temple, because they hastened to their private houses. He
   then reproves here their ardor in being intent on building their own
   houses, so that they had no leisure to build the Temple. This is the
   hastening which the Prophet blames and condemns in the Jews.

   We may hence learn again, that they had long delayed to build the
   sanctuary after the time had arrived: for, as we have mentioned
   yesterday, they who think the Jews returned in the fifty-eighth year,
   and that they had not then undergone the punishment denounced by
   Jeremiah, are very deluded; for they thus obscure the favor of God;
   nay, they wholly subvert the truth of the promises, as though they had
   returned contrary to God's will, through the permission of Cyrus, when
   yet Isaiah says, that Cyrus would be the instrument of their promised
   redemption. (Isaiah 45:1.) Surely, then, Cyrus must have been dead
   before the time was fulfilled! and in that case God could not have been
   the redeemer of his people. Therefore Eusebius, and those who agree
   with him, did thus most absurdly confound the order of time. It now
   follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [138] The first word in this verse, [phnh], is evidently a participle
   noun; similar instances we find in verse 6. The verse, literally
   rendered, is as follows-- Looking for much, and behold little!
   And you brought it home, and I blew upon it;
   On what account this, saith Jehovah of hosts?
   On account of my house, because it is waste,
   And ye are running, each to his own house. The first line is put in an
   absolute form, as is sometimes the case in Hebrew; "There has been," or
   some such words being understood. Both the Targum and the Septuagint
   read [hyh] instead of [hnh], which would be more suitable to the word
   which follows, which has [l] before it. The line would then be-- There
   has been looking for much, but it came to little. The "blowing" seems
   to be a metaphor taken from scorching wind, blowing on vegetation, and
   causing it to wither. The last line may be thus rendered-- And ye are
   delighted, each with his own house. --Ed.

   [139] This is the literal rendering--"On account of my house, because
   it is waste." ['sr] is not "which" here, for it is followed by [hv'],
   "it;" but a conjunction, "because." The word quod, in Latin, admits of
   two similar meanings.--Ed.

   Haggai 1:10, 11

   10. Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is
   stayed from her fruit.

   10. Propterea prohibiti super vos sunt coeli a rore, et terra a
   proventu suo prohibita est.

   11. And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains,
   and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon
   that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle,
   and upon all the labour of the hands.

   11. Et vocavi siccitatem super terram, et super montes, et super
   triticum, et super mustum (aut, vinium,) et super omne quod profert
   terra, et super hominem, et super animal, et super omnem laborem
   manuum.

   He confirms what the last verse contains--that God had made it evident
   that he was displeased with the people because their zeal for religion
   had become cold, and, especially, because they were all strangely
   devoted to their own interest and manifested no concern for building
   the Temple. Hence, he says, therefore the heavens are shut up and
   withhold the dew; that is, they distil no dew on the earth; and he
   adds, that the earth was closed that it produced no fruit; it yielded
   no increase, and disappointed its cultivators. As to the particle l-kn,
   ol-can, we must bear in mind what I have stated, that God did not
   regard the external and visible Temple, but rather the end for which it
   was designed; for it was his will then that he should be worshipped
   under the ceremonies of the law. When, therefore, the Jews offered
   mutilated, lame, or diseased sacrifices, they manifested impiety and
   contempt of God. It is yet true, that it was the same thing as to God;
   but he had not commanded sacrifices to be offered to him for his own
   sake, but that by such services they might foster true religion. When,
   therefore, he says now, that he punished their neglect of the Temple,
   we ought ever to regard that as a pattern of heavenly things, so that
   we may understand that the coldness and indifference of the Jews were
   reproved; because it hence evidently appeared that they had no care for
   the worship of God.

   With respect to the withholding of dew and of produce, we know that the
   Prophets took from the law what served to teach the people, and
   accommodated it to their own purposes. The curses of the law are
   general. (Deuteronomy 11:17.) It is therefore the same thing as though
   the Prophet had said, that what God had threatened by Moses was really
   fulfilled. It ought not to have been to them a new thing, that whenever
   heaven denied its dew and rain it was a sign of God's wrath. But as, at
   this day, during wars, or famine, or pestilence, men do not regard this
   general truth, it is necessary to make the application: and godly
   teachers ought wisely to attend to this point, that is, to remind men,
   according to what the state of things and circumstances may require,
   that God proves by facts what he has testified in his word. This is
   what is done by our Prophet now, withheld have the heavens the dew and
   the earth its produce [140]

   In a word, God intimates, that the heavens leave no care to provide for
   us, and to distil dew so that the earth may bring forth fruit, and that
   the earth also, though called the mother of men, does not of itself
   open its bowels, but that the heavens as well as the earth bear a sure
   testimony to his paternal love, and also to the care which he exercises
   over us. God then shows, both by the heavens and the earth, that he
   provides for us; for when the heavens and the earth administer and
   supply us with the blessings of God, they thus declare his love towards
   us. So also, when the heaven is, as it were, iron, and when the earth
   with closed bowels refuses us food, we ought to know that they are
   commissioned to execute on us the vengeance of God. For they are not
   only the instruments of his bounty, but, when it is necessary, God
   employs them for the purpose of punishing us. This is briefly the
   meaning.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [140] Calvin seems to have overlooked [lykm], "on your account." The
   verse is-- Therefore, on your account, withheld have the heavens from
   dew,
   And the earth has withheld its produce. The verb [kl'], to restrain, to
   keep back, to withhold, is used here twice, and in the first line in an
   intransitive sense, and in the second in a transitive sense, as it is
   often the case in other languages, when the same verb is both neuter
   and active. The 11th verse is passed by without any particular remarks.
   The word [chrv] is rendered "Siccitas--drought," as Jerome does, and
   also our version, as well as Newcome and Henderson; but Grotius and
   also Marckius very justly observe, that it means here "waste," or
   "desolation," it being the same word as is applied to God's house in
   verse 9. They left his house a waste; by a just retribution he had
   brought or called for a waste on the land, etc. The contrast is so
   evident that it cannot be denied. The ideal meanings of the word is to
   be waste or desolate: it is then applied to various things which
   produce desolation, the sword, drought, pestilence, etc.; but it is
   used here in its primary sense, and the contrast is very striking: "My
   house has been left waste; I have caused a waste to come upon every
   thing else." The verse may be thus rendered-- And I have called for a
   waste
   On the land and on the mountains,
   And on the corn and on the wine and on the oil,
   And on whatever the ground produces,
   And on man and on the cattle,
   And on all the labor of the hands. --Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou kindly and graciously invites us
   to thyself, we may not wait until thou stimulates us with goads, but
   cast aside our sloth and run quickly to thee. And when our torpor so
   possesses us as to render punishment necessary, permit us not to harden
   ourselves; but being at length effectually warned, and we return to the
   right way, and strive so to render all we do approved by thee, that we
   may find a door opened to thy grace and favor: and being made partakers
   of those blessed, by which thou affordest a taste of that goodness
   which we shall enjoy in heaven, may we ever aspire thither, and be
   satisfied with the abundant blessings which we daily and even
   continually receive from thine hand, in such a manner as not to be
   detained by this world; but may we, with minds raised up to heaven,
   ever tend upwards, and labor for that perfect happiness which is there
   laid up for us by Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Haggai 1:12

   12. Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
   Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed
   the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet,
   as the Lord their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the
   Lord.

   12. Et audivit Zerubbabel, filius Sealtiel, et Jehoasua, filius
   Jehosadak, sacerdos magnus, et omnes reliquiae populi vocem Iehovae Dei
   sui, et ad verba Chaggai Prophetae; quemadmodum miserat ipsum Iehova
   Deus eorum; et timuerunt populus a conspectu Iehovae.

   The Prophet here declares that his message had not been without fruit,
   for shortly after the whole people prepared themselves for the work.
   And he names both Zerubbabel and Joshua; for it behaved them to lead
   the way, and, as it were, to extend a hand to others. For, had there
   been no leaders, no one of the common people would have pointed out the
   way to the rest. We know what usually happens when a word is addressed
   indiscriminately to all the people: they wait for one another. But when
   Joshua and Zerubbabel attended to the commands of the Prophet, the
   others followed them: for they were dominant, not only in power, but
   also in authority, so that they induced the people willingly to do
   their duty. One was the governor of the people, the other was the high
   priest; but the honesty and faithfulness of both were well known, so
   that the people spontaneously followed their example.

   And this passage teaches us that though God invites all to his service,
   yet as any one excels in honor or in other respects, so the more
   promptly he ought to undertake what is proposed by the authority of
   God. Our Prophet, no doubt, meant to point out this due order of
   things, by saying, that he was heard first by Zerubbabel and Joshua,
   and then by the whole people.

   But as all had not returned from exile, but a small portion, compared
   with that great number, which, we know, had not availed themselves of
   the kindness allowed them--this is the reason why the Prophet does not
   simply name the people, but the remnant of the people, s'ryt hm, sharit
   eom. As also the gift of prophecy had been for a long time more rare,
   and few appeared among the people who had any decided evidence of their
   call, such as Samuel, Isaiah, David, and others possessed, the Prophet,
   for this reason, does here more carefully commend and honor his own
   office: he says that the people attended to the voice of Jehovah --How?
   By attending, he says, to the words of Haggai the Prophet, inasmuch as
   Jehovah their God had sent him. He might have said more shortly that
   his labor had not been without fruit; but he used this circuitous mode
   of speaking, that he might confirm his own call; and he did this
   designedly, because the people had for a long time been without the
   opportunity of hearing God's Prophets, for there were none among them.

   But Haggai says nothing here but what belongs in common to all teachers
   in the Church: for we know that men are not sent by divine authority to
   speak that God himself may be silent. As then the ministers of the word
   derogate nothing from the authority of God, it follows that none except
   the only true God ought to be heard. It is not then a peculiar
   expression, which is to be restricted to one man, when God is said to
   have spoken by the mouth of Haggai; for he thus declared that he was
   God's true and authorised Prophet. We may therefore gather from these
   words, that the Church is not to be ruled by the outward preaching of
   the word, as though God had substituted men in his own place, and thus
   divested himself of his own office, but that he only speaks by their
   mouth. And this is the import of these words, The people attended to
   the voice of Jehovah their God, and to the words of Haggai the Prophet.
   For the word of God is not distinguished from the words of the Prophet,
   as though the Prophet had added anything of his own. Haggai then
   ascribed these words to himself, not that he devised anything himself,
   so as to corrupt the pure doctrine which had been delivered to him by
   God, but that he only distinguished between God, the author of the
   doctrine, and his minister, as when it is said,

   "The sword of God and of Gideon," (Judges 7:20,)

   and also,

   "The people believed God and Moses his servant."
   (Exodus 14:31.)

   nothing is ascribed to Moses or to Gideon apart from God; but God
   himself is placed in the highest honor, and then Moses and Gideon are
   joined to him. In the same sense do the Apostles write, when they say,
   that "it had pleased the Holy spirit" and themselves. (Acts 15:22.)

   And hence it is evident how foolish and ridiculous are the Papists, who
   hence conclude that it is lawful for men to add their own inventions to
   the word of God. For the Apostles, they say, not only alleged the
   authority of the Holy Spirit, but also say, that it seemed good to
   themselves. God then does not so claim, they say, all things for
   himself, as not to leave some things to the decision of his Church, as
   though indeed the Apostles meant something different from what our
   Prophet means here; that is, that they truly and faithfully delivered
   what they had received from the spirit of God.

   It is therefore a mode of speaking which ought to be carefully marked,
   when we hear, that the voice of God and the words of Haggai were
   reverently attended to by the people.--Why? Inasmuch, he says, as God
   had sent him; as though he had said, that God was heard when he spoke
   by the mouth of man. And this is also worthy of being noticed, because
   many fanatics boast, that they allow regard to the word of the Lord,
   but are unwilling to give credit to men, as that would be even
   preposterous; and they pretend, that in this way what belongs to the
   only true God is transferred to creatures. But the Holy Spirit most
   easily reconciles these two things--that the voice of God is heard when
   the people embrace what they hear from the mouth of a Prophet. Why so?
   because it pleases God thus to try the obedience of our faith, while he
   commits to man this office. For if the Lord was pleased to speak
   himself, then justly might men be neglected: but as he has chosen this
   mode, whosoever reject God's Prophets, clearly show that they despise
   God himself. There is no need of inquiring here, why it is that we
   ought to obey the word preached or the external voice of men, rather
   than revelations; it is enough for us to know that this is the will of
   God. When therefore he sends Prophets to us, we ought unquestionably to
   receive what they bring.

   And Haggai says also expressly, that he was sent by the God of Israel;
   as though he had said, that the people had testified their true piety
   when they acknowledged God's Prophet in his legitimate vocation. For he
   who clamorously objects, and says that he knows not whether it pleases
   God or not to send forth men to announce his word, shows himself to be
   wholly alienated from God: for it ought to be sufficiently evident to
   us that this is one of our first principles.

   He afterwards adds, that the people feared before Jehovah [141] Haggai
   confirms here the same truth--that the people received not what they
   heard from the mouth of mortal man, otherwise than if the majesty of
   God had openly appeared. For there was no ocular view of God given; but
   the message of the Prophet obtained as much power as though God had
   descended from heaven, and had given manifest tokens of his presence.
   We may then conclude from these words, that the glory of God so shines
   in his word, that we ought to be so much affected by it, whenever he
   speaks by his servants, as though he were nigh to us, face to face, as
   the Scripture says in another place. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [141] This clause may be thus rendered,-- And fear him did the people
   on account of Jehovah. This comports better with the previous clause,
   that Jehovah had sent him. The [v] affixed to "fear" is a pronoun,
   otherwise the verb is plural; and "people" seldom, if ever, has a verb
   in the plural number. To fear sometimes means to respect, to reverence:
   the people honored him as God's servant, by obeying his message.--Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Haggai 1:13, 14

   13. Then spake Haggai the Lord's messenger in the LORD'S message unto
   the people, saying, I am with you, saith the Lord

   13. Et dicit Chaggai, legatus Iehovae in legatione Iehovae, dicendo
   (vel, dicens) populo, Ego vobiscum sum, dicit Iehova.

   14. And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
   Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of
   Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the
   people; and they came and did work in the house of the Lord of hosts,
   their God,

   14. Et excitavit Iehova spiritum Zerubbabel, filli Sealtiel, ducis
   Jehudah, et spiritum Jehosuae, filii Jehozadak, sacerdotis magni, et
   spiritum omnium reliquiarum (hoc est, totius residuae multitudinis)
   populi; et venerunt et fecerunt opus in templo (in domo, ad verbum)
   Iehovae exercituum Dei sui.

   The Prophet tells us here, that he had again roused the leaders as well
   as the common people; for except God frequently repeats his
   exhortations, our alacrity relaxes. Though then they had all attended
   to God's command, it was yet necessary that they should be strengthened
   by a new promise: for men can be encouraged, and their indifference can
   be corrected, by no other means, to such a degree, as when God offers
   and promises his help. This, then, was the way in which they were now
   encouraged, I am with you. And experience sufficiently shows, that we
   never really and from the heart obey, except when we rely on his
   promises and hope for a happy success. For were God only to call us to
   our work, and were our hope doubtful, all our zeal would doubtless die
   away. We cannot then devote our services to God, except he supports and
   encourages us by promises. We also see, that it is not enough that God
   should speak once, and that we should once receive his word, but there
   is need that he should rouse us again and again; for the greatest ardor
   grows cold when no goads are applied.

   And the Prophet makes known again his vocation, for he says, that he
   spake in the message of Jehovah, for he was his messenger. The word
   ml'k, malak, means a messenger; and as angels are called ml'kym,
   melakim, some foolish men have thought that Haggai was one of the
   celestial angels, clothed with the form of man: but this is a most
   frivolous conjecture; for priests, we know, are honored with this title
   in the second chapter of Malachi, Malachi 2:1, and God in many other
   places calls his Prophets messengers or ambassadors. There is,
   therefore, no doubt but that Haggai meant simply to testify, that he
   brought forward nothing presumptuously, but was a faithful dispenser of
   the word; for he knew that he was sent by God; and that he might attain
   attention, he was able justly to testify that his message came from
   heaven.

   Hence he says, that he spake as a messenger of Jehovah in the message
   of Jehovah; that is, he spoke according to his calling, and not as a
   private individual, but as one who derived his authority from heaven,
   and could call to order the whole people; for he was to give way
   neither to the chief priest nor to Zerubbabel the ruler of the people,
   inasmuch as he was superior to them on this account, because he had a
   message which had been committed to him by God. [142] We now then
   understand the design of the Prophet.

   And we hence learn that there is no dignity which exempts us from
   obedience common to all, when God's word is addressed to us. Doubtless
   Joshua the high priest was superior to all the rest in matters of
   religion, and he was the chief angel or messenger of the God of hosts;
   and yet he refused not to submit himself to God's Prophet, for he
   understood that he was in a special manner appointed by God to this
   office. Zerubbabel, the governor of the people, followed also his
   example. Let us, then, know that God's word is proclaimed under this
   condition, that no eminence, either in honor or in dignity, exempts us,
   as it were, by a sort of privilege, from the obligation of receiving
   it.

   The Prophet at length adds, that the people hastened quickly to the
   work, because God had given encouragement to them all. He had lately
   spoken of the fruit of his doctrine; but he now declares that his voice
   had not so penetrated into the hearts of all, as though it had been of
   itself efficacious, but that it had been connected with the hidden
   influence of the Spirit.

   And this passage is remarkable; for the Prophet includes both these
   things--that God allows not his word to be useless or unfruitful--and
   yet that this proceeds not from the diligence of men, but from the
   hidden power of the Spirit. The Prophet, then, did not fail in his
   efforts; for his labor was not in vain, but brought forth fruit. At the
   same time, that that saying might remain true,

   He who plants and he who waters is nothing,'
   (1 Corinthians 3:7,)

   he says, that the Israelites were ready for the work, because the Lord
   roused them; Jehovah, he says, stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the
   spirit of Joshua, and of the whole people. It is not right to restrict
   the influence of the Spirit to one thing only, as some do, who imagine
   that the Israelites were confirmed in their good resolution, as they
   say, having before spontaneously obeyed the word of God. These
   separate, without reason, what ought to be read in the Prophet as
   connected together. For God roused the spirit of Zerubbabel and of the
   whole people; and hence it was that they received the message of the
   Prophet, and were attentive to his words. Foolishly, then, do they
   imagine that the Israelites were led by their own free-will to obey the
   word of God, and then that some aid of the Holy Spirit followed, to
   make them firmly to persevere in their course. But the Prophet
   declared, in the first place, that his message was respectfully
   received by the people; and now he explains how it was, even because
   God had touched the hearts of the whole people. [143]

   And we ought to notice the expression, when it is said that the spirit
   of Zerubbabel and of all the people was stirred up. For much sloth, we
   know, prevailed, especially among the multitude. But as to Zerubbabel
   and Joshua, they were, as we have said, already willing, but delayed
   until the coldness under which they labored was reproved. But the
   Prophet here simply means, that they became thus obedient through the
   hidden impulse of God, and also that they were made firm in their
   purpose. God does not form new souls in us, when he draws us to his
   service; but changes what is wrong in us: for we should never be
   attentive to his word, were he not to open our ears; and there would be
   no inclination to obey, were he not to turn our hearts; in a word, both
   will and effort would immediately fail in us, were he not to add his
   gift of perseverance. Let us, then, know that Haggai's labors produced
   fruits, because the Lord effectually touched the hearts of the people;
   for we indeed know that it is his special gift, that the elect are made
   disciples, according to that declaration,

   No one comes to me, except my Father draw him.'
   (John 6:44.)

   It is therefore said that they came and did the work in the house of
   Jehovah

   We may also hence learn, that no one is fit to offer sacrifices to God,
   or to do any other service, but he who has been moulded by the hidden
   operation of the Spirit. Willingly, indeed, we offer ourselves and our
   all to God, and build his temple; but whence is this voluntary action,
   except that the Lord subdues us, and thus renders us teachable and
   obedient? It is afterwards added--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [142] The verse literally is-- Then said Haggai, the messenger of
   Jehovah in the message of
   Jehovah to the people, saying,
   I am with you, saith Jehovah. The word for "messages" is in the plural
   number, preceded by the preposition [v]. Why commentators have
   generally rendered it in the singular number, does not appear. Haggai
   is expressly said to be God's messenger in, or with regard to, the
   messages or communications he made to the people. To connect the word,
   as some do, with "said," hardly gives a meaning, except the clause be
   rendered, as it is done by Newcome, "by the message of Jehovah," that
   is, by his command; but then a plural word is made singular.--Ed.

   [143] It is sometimes the case, that a doctrine is illegitimately drawn
   from a passage, and then that it is unfairly opposed. The building of
   the Temple had nothing to do with the first movement of the spiritual
   life: and therefore to draw an argument from the willingness of the
   people to undertake that work in favor of free-will in the great
   business of salvation, is by no means legitimate. It would have been,
   then, better to deny the application, than to turn the passage from its
   regular course. But we shall not do violence to the passage, if we
   render the [v] at the beginning of this verse, "Thus," and refer "the
   stiring up" to the threatening and the promise previously announced.
   The object seems not to have been to set forth the direct influence of
   the Spirit on the minds of the people, but to show the effect produced
   on them by the message conveyed to them from the Lord by the Prophet.
   God stirs up the minds of men both by his word and by his Spirit, both
   outwardly and inwardly. The former may more properly be meant
   here.--Ed.

   Haggai 1:15

   15. In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second
   year of Darius the king.

   15. In die vicesimo quarto mensis sexti, anno secundo Darii regis.

   The Prophet mentions even the time when they commenced the building of
   the temple. Three-and-twenty days interposed between the first message
   and the beginning of the work. It hence appears how ignorant he was who
   divided the chapters, having begun the second chapter at this verse,
   where the Prophet shows, as it were by his finger, how much was the
   distance between the day in which he began to exhort the people, and
   the success of which he speaks. He then simply tells us here when the
   Temple began to be built--that is, in the second year of Darius the
   king, and in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. He had
   previously said that a message was given to him in the second year of
   Darius the king, and in the sixth month, and on the first day. Then
   from that day to the twenty-fourth the people delayed; not that they
   disregarded the command of the Prophet, but because it was not so easy
   a thing to persuade them all, that they might unanimously undertake the
   work. Though then the promptitude of the people is commended, we must
   yet observe that there was some mixture of weakness; for the effect of
   the doctrine did not appear till the twenty-fourth day. [144] It
   afterwards follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [144] The reasons assigned here for a different division is by no means
   satisfactory. The fact is that this verse necessarily belongs to the
   last of the previous chapter, as it specifies the time when the people
   began the work as there mentioned; and what follows this verse is
   another message, and at another time. The usual division is no doubt
   the best.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Haggai 2:1-5

   1. In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month,
   came the word of the Lord by the prophet Haggai, saying,

   1. In septimo et vicesimo uno mensis (hoc est, septimo mense, vicesima
   prima die mensis) fuit sermo Iehovae in manu Chaggai Prophetae,
   dicendo.

   2. Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and
   to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of
   the people, saying,

   2. Dic nunc ad Zerubbabel, filium Sealtiel, ducem Jehudah, et ad
   Jehosuah, filium Jehosadak, sacerdotem magnum, et ad reliquias populi,
   dicendo.

   3. Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and
   how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as
   nothing?

   3. Quis in vobis superstes (vel, residuus, ad verbum) qui viderit domum
   hanc in gloria sua priore, et quam vos videtis hanc nunc, annon prae
   illa sicut nihilum in oculis vestris?

   4. Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O
   Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people
   of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the
   Lord of hosts:

   4. Et nunc (vel, nunc tamen) fortis sis Zerubbabel, dicit Iehova, et
   fortis sis Jehosuah, fili Jehosadak, sacerdos magne, et fortis sis
   omnis populus terrae, dicit Iehova, et operamini, quia ego vobiscum,
   dicit Iehovah exercituum,

   5. According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of
   Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.

   5. Secundum verbum quod pepigi vobiscum dum egressi estis ex Egypto; et
   spiritus meus stabit (vel, perseverabit) in medio vestri, ne timeatis.

   The Prophet now states another reason why he had been sent by God, in
   order that he might obviate a temptation which might have hindered the
   work that was begun. We have seen that they were all stirred up by the
   celestial spirit to undertake the building of the Temple. But as Satan,
   by his many arts, attempts to turn back the godly from their course, so
   he had devised a reason by which the desire of the people might have
   been checked. Inasmuch as the old people, who had seen the splendor of
   the former temple, considered this temple no better than a cottage, all
   their zeal evaporated; for, as we have said, without a promise there
   will continue in men no ardor, no perseverance. Now we know what had
   been predicted by Ezekiel, and what all the other Prophets had
   testified, especially Isaiah, who had spoken highly of the excellency
   of the Church, and shown that it was to be superior to its ancient
   state. (Isaiah 33:21.) Besides, Ezekiel describes the form of the
   Temple, and states its dimensions. (Ezekiel 41:1.) As then the faithful
   had learnt from these prophecies that the new Temple would be more
   splendid than the ancient, they were in danger, not only of becoming
   cold in the business, but also of being wholly discouraged, when they
   perceived that the new Temple in no respect reached the excellency and
   grandeur of the ancient Temple. And these things are described at large
   by Josephus.

   But we may easily conclude, from the words of the Prophet, that there
   was then a danger lest they should lay aside the work they had begun,
   except they were encouraged by a new exhortation. And he says that this
   happened in the seventh month, and on the first day of the month.

   Here arises a question, How was it that they so soon compared the new
   with the old building. Seven or eight days had passed since the work
   was begun: nothing, doubtless, could have been then constructed, which
   might have afforded a ground of comparison. It seems then strange, that
   the Prophet had been so soon sent to them. An answer to this will be
   easily found, if we bear in mind, that what I have stated at the
   beginning of the first chapter, that the foundations of the Temple had
   been previously laid, but that there had been a long interruption: for
   the people had turned to their own private concerns, and all had become
   so devoted to their own advantages, that they neglected the building of
   the Temple. For it is wholly a false notion, that the people had
   returned from exile before the appointed time, and it has been
   sufficiently refuted by clear proofs; for scripture expressly declares,
   that both Cyrus and Darius had been led by a divine impulse to allow
   the return of the people. Hence, when the Jews returned to their
   country, they immediately began to build the Temple; but afterwards, as
   I have said, either avarice, or too anxious a desire for their own
   private benefit, laid hold on their minds. As then the building of the
   Temple had been for some time neglected, they were again encouraged, as
   our Prophet has shown to us. They had now hardly applied their hands to
   the work, when, through the artifice of Satan, such suggestions as
   these crept in--"What are ye doing, ye miserable men! Ye wish to build
   a Temple to your God; but what sort of Temple will it be? Certainly it
   will not be that which all the Prophets have celebrated. For what do we
   read in Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel? Have not all these testified
   that the Temple which would be rebuilt after our return from Babylonian
   exile would be more splendid than the other? But we now build a shed.
   Surely this is done without authority. We do not then fight under the
   guidance of God; and it would be better for us to leave off the work;
   for our service cannot be approved of God, except it be founded on his
   Word. And we see how far this Temple comes short of what God has
   promised."

   We now hence learn, that it was not without reason that Haggai was sent
   on the eighth day to recover the people from their indifference. And
   hence also we may learn how necessary it is for us to be constantly
   stimulated; for Satan can easily find out a thousand impediments, by
   which he may turn us aside from the right course, except God often
   repeats his exhortations to keep us awake. Eight days only have
   elapsed, and the people would have ceased from their work, had not
   Haggai been sent to encourage them again.

   Now the cause of this cessation, which the Prophet designed to obviate
   and to remove, ought to be especially noticed. The people had before
   ceased to work, because they were immoderately devoted to their own
   interest, which was a proof of base ingratitude and of profane impiety:
   for those who had no care for building the Temple were most ungrateful
   to God; and then their impiety was intolerable, inasmuch as they sought
   boarded houses to dwell in, being not content with decent houses
   without having them adorned, while the Temple was left, as it were, a
   wilderness. But the cause was different, when Haggai was sent the
   second time; for their indifference then arose from a good principle
   and a genuine feeling of religion. But we hence see what a subtle
   contriver Satan is, who not only draws us away openly from God's
   service, but insinuates himself in a clandestine manner, so as to turn
   us aside, under the cover of zeal, from the course of our vocation. How
   was it that the people became negligent after they had begun the work?
   even because it grieved the old men to see the glory of the second, so
   far inferior to the first Temple. For though the people animated
   themselves by the sound of trumpets, yet the old among them drowned the
   sound by their lamentations. Whence was this? even because they saw, as
   I have said, that this Temple was in no way equal to the ancient one;
   and hence they thought that God was not as yet reconciled to them. Had
   they said, that so great an expense was not necessary, that God did not
   require much money to be laid out, their impiety should have been
   openly manifested; but when they especially wished that the splendor of
   the Temple would be such, as might surely prove that the restoration of
   the Church was come, such as had been promised by all the Prophets, we
   doubtless perceive their pious feeling.

   But we are thus reminded, that we ought always to beware of the
   intrigues of Satan, when they appear under the cover of truth. When,
   therefore, our minds are disposed to piety, Satan is ever to be feared,
   lest he should stealthily suggest to us what may turn us aside from our
   duty; for we see that some leave the Church because they require in it
   the highest perfection. They are indignant at vices which they deem
   intolerable, when they cannot be corrected: and thus, under the pretext
   of zeal, they separate themselves and seek to form for themselves a new
   world, in which there is to be a perfect Church; and they lay hold on
   those passages in which the Holy Spirit recommends purity to the
   Church, as when Paul says, that it was purchased by Christ, that it
   might be without spot or wrinkle. As then these are inflamed with a
   zeal so rigid that they depart from God himself and violate the unity
   of the Church; so also there are many proud men who despise the Church
   of God, because it shines not forth among them in great pomp; and they
   think that God does not dwell in the midst of us, because we are
   obscure and of no great importance, and also because they regard our
   few number with contempt.

   In all these there is some appearance of piety. How so? Because they
   would have God to be reverenced, so that they would have the whole
   world to be filled with the fear of his majesty; or they would have
   much wealth to be gathered, so that sumptuous offerings might be made.
   But, as I have already said, Satan thus cunningly insinuates himself;
   and hence we ought to fear his intrigues, lest, under plausible
   pretences, he should dazzle our eyes. But the best way of caution is to
   regard what God commands, and so to rely on his promises as to proceed
   steadily in our course, though the accomplishment of the promises does
   not immediately correspond with our desires; for God designedly keeps
   us in suspense in order to try our faith. Though then he may not as yet
   fulfill what he has promised, let it yet be our course to attempt
   nothing rashly, while we are obeying his command. It will then be our
   chief wisdom, by which we may escape all the crafts of Satan, simply to
   obey God's word, and to exercise our hope so as patiently to wait the
   seasonable time, when he will fulfill what he now promises.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are not only alienated in mind from
   thee, but also often relapse after having been once stirred up by thee,
   either into perverseness, or into our own vanity, or are led astray by
   various things, so that nothing is more difficult than to pursue our
   course until we reach the end of our race,--O grant that we may not
   confide in our own strength, nor claim for ourselves more than what is
   right, but, with our hearts raised above, depend on thee alone, and
   constantly call on thee to supply us with new strength, and so to
   confirm us that we may persevere to the end in the discharge of our
   duty, until we shall at length attain the true and perfect form of that
   temple which thou commandest us to build, in which thy perfect glory
   shines forth, and into which we are to be transformed by Christ our
   Lord. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Thirty-first

   The Prophet, after having declared why it was necessary to add new
   stimulants, now exhorts Zerubbabel and Joshua, and also the people, to
   be courageous, and thus to proceed with the work. And he again repeats
   what he had said, that the Lord was with them; I am with you, he says.
   Now this one thing is enough for us, that is, when God declares that he
   is with us; for his aid, we know, is stronger than the whole world,
   however Satan may on every side attempt to resist us.

   He also adds, that his Spirit would be in the midst of them; and then
   he says, that there was no reason for them to fear. By his Spirit God
   means the power by which he strengthened their minds, that they might
   not give way to their trials, or, that fear might not hinder them. And
   what is particular is joined to what is general; for God is present
   with his own in various ways: but he especially shows, that he is
   present when, by his Spirit, he confirms weak minds. He then bids them
   all to be of a courageous mind. This is one thing. But he also shows
   whence this courage proceeded; for he sustained them by his Spirit when
   they were growing faint, or when they were not able to resist fears.
   The Prophet reminds them by these words, that courage was to be sought
   from God.

   We hence learn that what belongs to our calling and duty is not
   required from us as though we were able to perform everything; but when
   the Lord, according to his own right, commands, he offers the help of
   his Spirit; and thus we ought to connect the promise of grace with the
   precept, of which foolish men take no notice, who deduce free will from
   what is commanded: for they thus reason--that it is in vain to require
   from us what is above our ability, and that as God requires us to form
   our life according to the rule of the highest perfection, it is
   therefore in our power to perform the highest justice. But the Prophet
   here, in the first place, exhorts Joshua and Zerubbabel, and the whole
   people, to be courageous, and then, he immediately adds, that the
   Spirit of God would be in the midst of them; as though he had said,
   that there was no reason for them to despond, though they had not
   sufficient strength in themselves; for courage was to be sought from
   the Spirit of God, who would dwell among them. In short, the Prophet
   teaches us that the faithful are so to strive as not to arrogate
   anything to themselves, but to offer themselves to be ruled by the
   Lord, that he may supply them with weapons as well as with strength,
   and thus conquer in them; for though the victory is ascribed to us it
   is yet certain that God conquers in us.

   He then adds, According to the word; for so I render the particle 't,
   at [145] They who think that the Jews are here reminded that it was
   their duty to obey God, and purely to serve him, and truly to keep his
   law, according to what he had commanded them when he brought them out
   of the land of Egypt, far depart from the design of the Prophet; for
   the Prophet pursues the same subject; and in the latter clause he
   confirms what I have just mentioned--that the Spirit of God would be in
   the midst of them. He therefore shows that he promises nothing new, but
   what God had formerly engaged to give to their fathers. If any one
   prefers taking the particle 't, at in an explicative sense, I do not
   object; for the meaning would be the same--that this is the word which
   he had promised. The object of the Prophet is by no means doubtful; for
   he means to teach us that God is faithful and constant in his promises,
   and that the Jews would find this to be the case, for he would perform
   what he had formerly promised to their fathers. The word, he says,
   which I had covenanted with you when I brought you out of Egypt. For
   the Prophets were wont to remind the faithful of the ancient covenant,
   that they might gain more credit to their special prophecies. We indeed
   know that whatever God had promised to the Jews, was founded on their
   first adoption. When, therefore, the Prophets brought forward the
   ancient covenant, it was the same as though they led the Jews back to
   the fountain itself; for the promises, which now and then occurred,
   were like streams which flowed from the first spring, even their
   gratuitous covenant.

   We now then see why an express mention is made of the ancient compact
   which God had made with the chosen people at their departure out of
   Egypt.

   It must also be observed, that God became then the Redeemer of his
   people, in order to be their eternal Father, and thus to be the
   perpetual guardian of their safety. Hence the design of what the
   Prophet says is to show that their fathers were not formerly redeemed,
   that their children might reject God, but that he might continue his
   favor to his people to the end. But the ultimate issue is to be found
   in Christ, that is, the full accomplishment; for God does not cease to
   show kindness in him to his chosen people, but performs much more fully
   and abundantly what he had previously exhibited under types and
   shadows. For whatever he conferred on his ancient Church, was, as it
   were, a prelude of his vast bounty, which was at length made known by
   the coming of Christ.

   We now clearly apprehend what the Prophet meant: For he upbraided the
   Jews for their stupidity, because they did not consider that their
   fathers were formerly delivered from Egypt, that God might defend them
   to the end. Hence he bids them maturely to examine the design and
   character of the covenant which God made at their departure from Egypt;
   for he entered into covenant with them, that he might be their
   Redeemer, and confer on them the fullness of all blessings. Since it is
   so, he says, the time is now come when God will perform what he then
   promised to your fathers; and whatever faithfulness ye have hitherto
   found in God, ought to be applied for this end--that ye may feel
   assured that ye have been now restored to your country, in order that
   he might re-establish his Church, and that ye might not continue in
   that low condition, which now depresses your minds. As then ye ought to
   look for that fullness of happiness which God formerly promised, either
   his covenant is void and he unfaithful, or ye ought with cheerfulness
   and alacrity to proceed with the work. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [145] This is the most approved manner. There is no instance in which
   it means "according." It may be rendered--"This is the word," etc.
   There were two things which were intended to dispel their fear--the
   covenant made with the fathers, and the Spirit of God--the spirit of
   prophecy, "standing," or existing among them. The Chaldee Paraphrase
   is--"My Prophets are teaching among you." The verse may be thus
   translated-- This is the word which I covenanted with you
   At your coming forth from Egypt,
   And my Spirit is continuing among you; fear not. Junius and Tremelius
   render the ['t], "with," and the verse thus-- With the word (i.e.,
   having the word) which I covenanted with you
   When ye came forth from Egypt,
   And with my Spirit standing among you, fear not. Henderson considers
   "the word," and "my Spirit," to be nominatives to the particle
   "standing," or rather to the auxiliary verb which is to be understood
   before it, and that "standing" is in the singular number, on account of
   the nearer nominative "my Spirit." Newcome follows our version, and
   views ['t] as a preposition--"according to."--Ed.

   Haggai 2:6-9

   6. For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while,
   and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry
   land;

   6. Quia sit dicit Iehova exercituum, Adhuc unum modicum hoc, et ego
   commovebo coelos et terram et mare et aridam;

   7. And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall
   come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.

   7. Et commovebo omnes gentes, et venient, desiderium omnium gentium; et
   implebo domum hance gloria, dicit Iehova exercituum.

   8. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.

   8. Meum argentum, et meum aurum, dicit Iehova exercituum.

   9. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former,
   saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the
   LORD of hosts.

   9. Major erit gloria domus hujus secundae (posterioris, ad verbum,)
   quam prioris dicit Iehova exercituum: et in loco hoc dabo pacem, dicit
   Iehova exercituum.

   Here the Prophet expresses more clearly, and confirms more fully, what
   I have said--that God would in time bring help to the miserable Jews,
   because he would not disappoint the assurance given to the fathers.
   This declaration, then, depends on the covenant before mentioned; and
   hence the causative particle is used, For thus saith Jehovah of hosts,
   as yet a small one it is, or, yet shortly, I will fill this house with
   glory. The expression a small thing, most interpreters apply to time.
   Yet there are those who think the subject itself is denoted. The more
   received opinion is, that it means a small duration, a short time,
   because God would soon make a change for the better. "Though then there
   does not as yet appear the accomplishment of the promises, by which ye
   have hitherto supported your faith and your hope, yet after a short
   time God will really prove that he has spoken nothing falsely to you."

   There are yet some, as I have said, who think that the matter itself is
   denoted by the Prophet, even that the Temple did not yet appear in
   splendor before the eyes of men, a small one it is, that is, Ye see not
   indeed a building such as that was, before the Assyrians and the
   Chaldeans took possession of the city; but let not your eyes remain
   fixed on the appearance of this Temple. Let then this small one as yet
   pass by; but in a short time this house will be filled with glory

   With regard to the main object, it was the Prophet's design to
   strengthen the minds of the godly, that they might not think that the
   power of God was inefficient, though he had not as yet performed what
   they had hoped. In short, they were not to judge by present appearances
   of what had been previously said of their redemption. We said yesterday
   that the minds of the godly were heavily depressed, because the
   Prophets had spoken in high terms of the Temple as well as of the
   kingdom: the kingdom was as yet nothing; and the temple was more like a
   shed than what might have been compared in glory with the former
   Temple. It was hence necessary for the Prophet to meet this objection;
   and this is the reason why he bids them to overlook the present
   appearance, and to think of the glory which was yet hidden. As yet, he
   says, it is a small one; that is, "There is no reason for you to
   despair, though the grandeur of the Temple does not as yet appear to be
   so great as you have conceived; but, on the contrary, let your minds
   pass over to that restoration which is still far distant. As yet then a
   small one it is; and I will move the heavens and the earth." [146]

   In a word, God here bids them to exercise patience, until he should put
   forth the ineffable power of his hand to restore fully his Church; and
   this is what is meant by the shaking of the heaven and the earth.

   But this is a remarkable passage. The Jews indeed, who are very absurd
   in everything connected with the kingdom of Christ, pervert what is
   here said by the Prophet, and even reduce it to nothing. But the
   Apostle in Hebrews 12:1 reminds us of what God means here. For this
   passage contains an implied contrast between the law and the gospel,
   between redemption, just mentioned here, and that which was to be
   expected, and was at length made known by the coming of Christ. God,
   then, when he redeemed his people from Egypt, as well as from Babylon,
   moved the earth: but the Prophet announces here something greater--that
   God would shake the heaven and the earth. But that the meaning of the
   Prophet may appear more evident, each sentence must be examined in
   order.

   He says first, this once, shortly. I am inclined to apply this to time,
   that I may not depart from what is commonly received. But there is no
   reason for us to contend on the subject, because it makes little or no
   difference as to the main point. For we have said that what the Prophet
   had in view was to show that the Jews were not to fix their eyes and
   their minds on the appearance of the Temple at the time: "Allow," he
   says, "and give place to hope, because your present state shall not
   long remain; for the Lord will shake the heaven and the earth; think
   then of God's power, how great it is; does he not by his providence
   rule both the earth and the heaven? And he will shake all things above
   and below, rather than not to restore his Church; he will rather change
   the appearance of the whole world, than that redemption should not be
   fully accomplished. Be not then unwilling to be satisfied with these
   preludes, but know what God's power can do: for though it may be
   necessary to throw the heaven and the earth into confusions, yet this
   shall be done, rather than that your enemies should prevent that full
   restoration, of which the Prophets have so often spoken." But the
   Apostle very justly says, that the gospel is here set in contrast with
   the law; for God exhibited his wonderful power, when the law was
   promulgated on mount Sinai; but a fuller power shone forth at the
   coming of Christ, for then the heaven, as well as the earth, was
   shaken. It is not, then, without reason that the Apostle concludes that
   God speaks now to us from heaven, for his majesty appears more splendid
   in the gospel than formerly in the law: and hence we are less
   excusable, if we despise him now speaking in the person of his only
   begotten Son, and thus speaking to show to us that the whole world is
   subject to him.

   He then adds, I will move all the nations, and they shall come. After
   having mentioned the heaven and the earth, he now shows that he would
   arrest the attention of all mortals, so as to turn them according to
   his will, in any way it may please him: Come, he says, shall all
   nations--How? because I shall shake them. Here again the Prophet
   teaches us that men come not to Christ except through the wonderful
   agency of God. He might have spoken more simply, I will lead all
   nations, as it is said elsewhere; but his purpose was to express
   something more, even that the impulse by which God moves his elect to
   betake themselves to the fold of Christ is supernatural. Shaking seems
   a forcible act. Lest men, then, should obscure the power of God, by
   which they are roused that they may obey Christ, and submit to his
   authority, it is here by the Prophet expressed by this term, in order
   that they might understand that the Lord does not work in an usual or
   common manner, when they are thus changed.

   But it must be also observed, that men are thus powerfully, and in an
   extraordinary or supernatural manner influenced, so that they follow
   spontaneously at the same time. The operation of God is then twofold;
   for it is first necessary to shake men, that they may unlearn their
   whole character, that is, that forgetting their former nature, they may
   willingly receive the yoke of Christ. We indeed know how great is our
   perverseness, and how unnameable we are, until God subdues us by his
   Spirit. There is need in such a case of a violent shaking. But we are
   not forced to obey Christ, as lions and wild beasts are, who indeed
   yield, but still retain their inward ferocity, and roar, though led in
   chains and subdued by scourges and beatings. We are not, then, so
   shaken, that our inward rebellion remains in us; but we are shaken, so
   that our disposition is changed, and we receive willingly the yoke of
   Christ. This is the reason why the Prophet says, I will shake all
   nations, and they shall come; that is, there will be indeed a wonderful
   conversion, when the nations who previously despised God, and regarded
   true religion and piety with the utmost hatred, shall habituate
   themselves to the ruling power of God: and they shall come, because
   they shall be so drawn by his hidden influence, that the obedience they
   shall render will be voluntary. We now perceive the meaning of the
   Prophet.

   He afterwards adds, The desire of all nations. This admits of two
   explanations. The first is, that nations shall come and bring with them
   everything that is precious, in order to consecrate it to the service
   of God; for the Hebrews call whatever is valuable a desire; so that
   under this term they include all riches, honors, pleasures, and
   everything of this kind. Hence some render the passage thus, I will
   shake all nations, and come shall the desire of all nations. As there
   is a change of number; others will have v, beth, or m, mem, to be
   understood, They shall come with what they desire; that is, the nations
   shall not come empty, but shall gather all their treasures to be a holy
   oblation to God. But we may understand what he says of Christ, Come
   shall the desire of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory.
   We indeed know that Christ was the expectation of the whole world,
   according to what is said by Isaiah. And it may be properly said, that
   when the desire of all nations shall come, that is, when Christ shall
   be manifested, in whom the wishes of all ought to center, the glory of
   the second Temple shall then be illustrious; but as it immediately
   follows, Mine is the silver, and mine is the gold, the more simple
   meaning is that which I first stated--that the nations would come,
   bringing with them all their riches, that they might offer themselves
   and all their possessions as a sacrifice to God.

   It is, then, better to read what follows as an explanation, Mine is the
   silver, mine is the gold, saith Jehovah; that is, "I have not through
   want of money deferred hitherto the complete building of the Temple;
   for what can hinder me from amassing gold and silver from all quarters?
   Should it so please me, I could in a short time build a Temple by all
   the wealth of the world. Is it not indeed in my power to create
   mountains of gold and silver, by which I might erect for myself a
   Temple? Ye hence see that wealth is not wanting to me to build the
   Temple which I have promised; but the time is not arrived. Therefore
   they who believe the preceding predictions, ought to wait and to look
   forward, until the suitable time shall come." This is the import of the
   passage. [147]

   He at length declares that the glory of the second Temple would be
   greater than that of the first, and that there would be peace in that
   place. As to the words there is nothing obscure; but we ought
   especially to attend to what is said.

   It must, indeed, be first observed, that what is said here of the
   future glory of the Temple is to be applied to the excellency of those
   spiritual blessings which appeared when Christ was revealed, and are
   still conspicuous to us through faith; for ungodly men are so blind
   that they see them not. And this we must bear in mind, lest we dream
   like some gross interpreters, who think that what is here said was in
   part fulfilled when Herod reconstructed the Temple. For though that was
   a sumptuous building, yet there is no doubt but that it was an attempt
   of the Devil to delude the Jews, that they might cease to hope for
   Christ. Such was also, probably, the craft of Herod. We indeed know
   that he was only a half-Jew. He professed himself to be one of
   Abraham's children; but he accommodated his habits, we know, to those
   of the Jews, oddly for his own advantage. That they might not look for
   Christ, this delusive and empty spectacle was presented to them, so as
   almost to astound them. Though this, however, may not have entered into
   the mind of Herod, it is yet certain that the Devil's design was to
   present to the Jews this deceptive shade, that they might not raise up
   their thoughts to look for the coming of Christ, as the time was then
   near at hand.

   God might, indeed, immediately at the beginning have caused a
   magnificent temple to be built: as he had allowed a return to the
   people, so he might have given them courage, and supplied them with
   materials, to render the latter Temple equal or even superior to the
   Temple of Solomon. But Cyrus prohibited by an edict the Temple to be
   built so high, and he also made its length somewhat smaller: Why was
   this done? and why also did Darius do the same, who yet liberally
   helped the Jews, and spared no expense in building the Temple? How was
   it that both these kings, though guided by the Spirit of God, did not
   allow the Temple to be built with the same splendor with which it had
   been previously erected? This did not happen without the wonderful
   counsel of God; for we know how gross in their notions the Jews had
   been, and we see that even the Apostles were entangled in the same
   error; for they expected that the kingdom of Christ would be no other
   than an earthly one. Had then this Temple been equally magnificent with
   the former, and had the kingdom become such as it had been, the Jews
   would have acquiesced in these outward pomps; so that Christ would have
   been despised, and God's spiritual favor would have been esteemed as
   nothing. Since, then, they were so bent on earthly happiness, it was
   necessary for them to be awakened; and the Lord had regard to their
   weakness, by not allowing a splendid Temple to be built. But in
   suffering a counterfeit Temple to be built by Herod, when the
   manifestation of Christ was nigh, he manifested his vengeance by
   punishing their ingratitude, rather than his favor; and I call it
   counterfeit, because its splendor was never approved by God. Though
   Herod spent great treasures on that building, he yet profaned rather
   than adorned the Temple. Foolishly, then, do some commemorate what
   Helena, queen of Adiabenians, had laid out, and think that thus a
   credit is in some measure secured to this prophecy. But it was on the
   contrary Satan who attempted to deceive by such impostures and crafts,
   that he might draw away the minds of the godly from the beauty of the
   spiritual Temple.

   But why does the prophet mention gold and silver? He did this in
   conformity with what was usual and common; for whenever the Prophets
   speak of the kingdom of Christ, they delineate or describe its splendor
   in figurative terms, suitable to their own age. When Isaiah foretells
   the restoration of the Church, he declares that the Church would be all
   gold and silver, and whatever glittered with precious stones; and in
   Isaiah 60:1 he especially sets forth the magnificence of the Temple, as
   though nations from all parts were to bring for sacrifice all their
   precious things. But Isaiah speaks figuratively, as all the other
   Prophets do. So then what we read of gold and of silver ought to be so
   explained as to be applied mystically to the kingdom of Christ; as we
   have already observed respecting Malachi 1:11--

   They shall offer to me, saith the Lord,
   pure sacrifices from the rising to the setting of the sun.'

   What are these sacrifices? Are heifers yet to be offered, or lambs, or
   other animals? By no means; but we must regard the spiritual character
   of the priesthood; for as the gold of which the Prophet now speaks, and
   the silver, ought to be taken in a spiritual sense; for since Christ
   has appeared in the world, it is not God's will to be served with gold
   and silver vessels; so also there is no altar on which victims are to
   be sacrificed, and no candlestick; in a word, all the symbols of the
   law have ceased. It hence follows that the Prophet speaks of the
   spiritual ornaments of the Temple. And thus we perceive how the glory
   of the second Temple is to be greater than that of the first.

   It then follows, that God would give peace in this place; as though he
   had said that it would be well with the Jews if they only waited
   patiently for the complete fulfillment of redemption. But it must be
   observed, that this peace was not so evident to them that they could
   enjoy it according to the perception of the flesh; but it was that kind
   of peace of which Paul speaks, and which, he says, exceeds all
   understanding (Philippians 4:7.) In short, the people could not have
   comprehended what the Prophet teaches here respecting the future
   splendor of the Temple, except they leaped over all the obstacles which
   seemed to obstruct the progress of complete redemption; and so it was
   ever necessary for them to have recourse to this truth--yet a little
   while; as though he said that they were patiently to endure while God
   was exercising their faith: but that the time would come, and that
   shortly, when the Lord would fill that house with glory that is, when
   Christ would bring witch him all fullness of glory; for though they
   were to gather the treasures of a thousand worlds into one mass, such a
   glory would yet be corruptible; but when God the Father appeared in the
   person of his own Son, he then glorified indeed his Temple; and his
   majesty shone forth so much that there was nothing wanting to a
   complete perfection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [146] Our common version is no doubt the best, and is materially
   followed by Newcome, Henderson, and many others. Retaining the tense of
   the passage, I would render the clause thus, Yet once, shortly will it
   be,
   And I will shake, etc. "Shortly will it be," [mt hy'] (shortly it) may
   be taken as a parenthesis. Yet once more, in a short time--Newcome. Yet
   once, within a little,--Henderson. The shaking of the heavens, earth,
   sea, and dry land is explained, according to the common manner of the
   Prophets, in the next verse, by shaking of all nations: the material
   world is named in the first instance, while its inhabitants are
   intended. So Henderson very properly renders the [m] at the beginning
   of the seventh verse, "Yea."--Ed.

   [147] Many have been the criticisms on this clause, both as to its
   grammatical construction and as to the import of the word rendered
   "desire." The verb "come" is plural, and the word for "desire" is
   singular. The easiest solution, and countenanced by the Septuagint,
   where the word is rendered ta eklekta--"choice things," is to consider
   [chmdt] as a plural, the [v] being omitted. This would remove the
   grammatical anomaly, and the sentiment, as Calvin says, woud be more
   consonant with the context. And come shall the choice things of all
   nations. There is no ground for the objection which Bishop Chandler
   states, that to "come" is in this case an improper expression; for
   there are other similar instances. See Joshua 6:12; Isaiah 60:5. It is
   also applied to trees, Isaiah 60:13; and to incense, Jeremiah 6:20.
   Newcome takes the word as a plural, but applies it as deliciae in Latin
   to a person, and refers to Daniel 9:23; where Daniel is called
   [chmvdvt], rendered in our version "greatly beloved." The version of
   Henderson is the following-- And the things desired by all nations
   shall come. He considers that they are the blessings of the kingdom of
   Christ, and thinks that the Prophet refers to the general expectation
   which pervaded the world of some better state of things, and especially
   of some deliverer. But the most tenable is the view of Calvin, which
   has been held by Kimchi, Drusius, Vitringa, and others.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that since we are by nature extremely prone to
   superstition, we may carefully consider what is the true and right way
   of serving thee, such as thou dost desire and approve, even that we
   offer ourselves spiritually to thee, and seek no other altar but
   Christ, and relying on no other priest, hope to be acceptable and
   devoted to thee, that he may imbue us with the Spirit which has been
   fully poured on him, so that we may from the heart devote ourselves to
   thee, and thus proceed patiently in our course, that with minds raised
   upwards we may ever go on towards that glory which is as yet hid under
   hope, until it shall at length be manifested in due time, when thine
   only-begotten Son shall appear with the elect angels for our final
   redemption. Amen.

   Haggai 2:10-14

   10. In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second
   year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet,
   saying,

   10. Vicesimo quarto noni (mensis, subaudiendum,) anno secundo Darii,
   fuit sermo Iehovae ad Chaggai Prophetam, dicendo.

   11. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the
   law, saying,

   11. Sic dicit Iehova exercituum, Interroga Sacerdotes de Lege, dicendo,

   12. If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his
   skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall
   it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

   12. Si sustulerit vir (quispiam) carnem sanctam in ala vestis suae, et
   tetegerit ala sua panem, et coctionem, et vinum, et olcum, et quodvis
   edulium, an sanctificabitur? Et responderunt Sacerdotes et dixerunt,
   Non.

   13. Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any
   of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It
   shall be unclean.

   13. Et dixit Chaggai, Si tetegerit pollutus in anima omne hoc, an
   polluetur? Responderunt Sacerdotes, et dixerunt, Polluetur.

   14. Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this
   nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands;
   and that which they offer there is unclean.

   14. Et respondi Chaggai et dixit, Sic populus iste, et sic gens ista in
   conspectu meo, dicit Iehova: et sic omne opus manuum ipsorum, et quod
   obtulerint illic, pollutum erit.

   Though interpreters seem to perceive the meaning of the Prophet, yet no
   one really and clearly expresses what he means and intends to teach us:
   nay, they adduce nothing but what is jejune and frigid; for they refer
   all these things to this point,--that sacrifices were not acceptable to
   God before the people had begun to build the Temple, but that from that
   time they were pleasing to God, because the people, in offering
   sacrifices in a waste place, proved by such negligence that they
   disregarded the command of God: but when their hands were applied to
   the work, God was appeased, and thus he began to accept their
   sacrifices which before he had rejected. This is, indeed, a part of
   what is meant, but not the whole; and the Prophet's main object seems
   to me to be wholly different. He has been hitherto exhorting the people
   to build the Temple; he now exhorts them to build from a pure motive,
   and not to think that they had done everything when the Temple assumed
   a fine appearance before the eyes of men, for God required something
   else. Hence, I have no doubt but that the Prophet intended here to
   raise up the minds of the people to the spiritual worship of God.

   It was, indeed, necessary diligently to build the Temple, but the end
   was also to be regarded; for God never cared for external ceremonies;
   nor was he delighted with that building as men are with their splendid
   houses. As the Jews absurdly ascribed these gross feelings to God, the
   Prophet here shows why so strict a command had been given as to the
   building of the Temple; and the reason was,--that God might be
   worshipped in a pure and holy manner.

   I will repeat again what I have said, that the explanation may be more
   familiar to you. When the people neglected the building of the Temple,
   they manifested their impiety and their contempt of Divine worship: for
   what was the cause of their delay and tardiness, except that each of
   them regarded nothing but just his own private interest? Now, when all
   of them strenuously undertook the work of building the Temple, their
   industry was indeed laudable, for it was a proof of their piety: but
   when the people thought that God required nothing more than a splendid
   Temple, it was manifest superstition: for the worship of God, we know,
   is corrupted when it is confined to external things; for, in this
   manner God is transformed into a nature not his own: as he is a Spirit,
   so he must be spiritually worshipped by us. Whosoever then obtrudes on
   him only external pomps in order to pacify him, most childishly trifles
   with him. This second part, in my view, is what the Prophet now
   undertakes to handle. From the seventh to the ninth month they had been
   diligently engaged in the work which the Lord had commanded them to do:
   but men, as we know, busy themselves with external things and neglect
   spiritual worship; hence it was necessary to join what is said here,
   that the people might understand, that it was not enough to satisfy
   God, though they spared neither expense nor labor in building the
   Temple; but that something greater was required, even to worship God in
   it in a pure and holy manner. This is the design of the whole passage.
   But we must first examine the Prophet's words, and then it will be
   easier to gather the whole import of his doctrine.

   He says then that he was ordered by God, on the twenty fourth day of
   the month, in the same year, in the second year of Darius, to ask the
   priests concerning the law [148] Haggai is not bid to inquire
   respecting the whole law, but only that the priests should answer a
   question according to the Word of God, or the doctrine of the law
   according to what is commonly said--What is law, is the question: for
   it was not allowed to the priests to allege anything they pleased
   indiscriminately; but they were only interpreters of the law. This is
   the reason why God bids his Prophet to inquire what the law of Moses
   defines as to the ceremony mentioned here. And the design was, that the
   people, being convinced as to the legal ceremonies, might not contend
   nor glamour, but acknowledge that all sorts are condemned as sinful
   which flow not from a pure and sincere heart.

   Haggai asks first, If a man takes holy flesh --that is, some part of
   the sacrifice,--if any one takes and carries it in a sleeve or skirt,
   that is, in any part of his vestment, and then touches bread, or oil,
   or any eatable thing, will anything connected with that holy flesh be
   sanctified by mere touch? The priests answer, No. Here also
   interpreters grossly mistake: for they take sanctified as meaning
   polluted, altogether falsely; for there is here a twofold question
   proposed. Whether holy flesh sanctifies anything it may touch? and
   then, whether an impure and a polluted man contaminates whatever he may
   touch? As to the first question, the priests wisely and truly answer,
   that there is no such efficacy in sacrifices, as that they can sanctify
   what they may touch: and this is true. The second definition is also
   most proper, that whatever is touched by an unclean man is polluted, as
   the law everywhere declares.

   The Prophet then accommodates this to his present case, So, he says, is
   this people, and this nation, and the work of their hands. For as long
   as they are polluted, however they may spend money in sacrifices, and
   greatly weary themselves in worshipping God, not only is their labor
   vain, but whatever they offer is polluted, and is an abomination only.
   We now understand the words of the Prophet, and so we may now consider
   the subject.

   But before I speak generally of the present subject, I shall first
   notice what the Prophet says here, that he inquired respecting the law;
   for it was not allowed to the priests to allege anything they pleased.
   We indeed know, that they had advanced into such licentiousness, as
   arbitrarily to demand what God had never commanded, and also to forbid
   the people what was lawful, the use of which had been permitted by
   God's law. But Haggai does not here allow such a liberty to the
   priests; he does not ask what they thought, but what was required by
   the law of the Lord. And this is worthy of being noticed; for it is a
   pernicious evil to exercise an arbitrary control over the conscience.
   And yet the devil has ever corrupted the worship of God, and the whole
   system of religion, under the pretense of extolling the authority of
   the Church. It is indeed true, that the sacerdotal office was very
   honorable and worthy of respect; but we must ever take heed lest men
   assume too much, and lest what is thoughtlessly conceded to them should
   deprive God of what belongs to him; as the case is, we know, under the
   Papacy. When the Pope seeks to show that all his commands ought without
   any dispute to be obeyed, he quotes what is found in Deuteronomy 17:8
   --

   If a question arises about the law,
   the high priest shall judge between what is sacred and profane.'

   This is indeed true; but was it permitted to the high priest to
   disregard God's law, and foolishly to allege this or that according to
   his own judgement? Nay, the priest was only an interpreter of the law.
   Whenever then God bids those pastors to be heard whom he sets over his
   Church, his will is, as it has been before stated, that he himself
   should be heard through their mouth. In short, whatever authority is
   exercised in the Church ought to be subjected to this rule--that God's
   law is to retain its own pre-eminence, and that men blend nothing of
   their own, but only define what is right according to the Word of the
   Lord. Now this is by the way; I come now to the main point.

   The priests answered, that neither flesh, nor oil, nor wine, was
   sanctified by touching a piece or part of a sacrifice. Why? because a
   sacrifice sanctifies not things unclean, except by way of expiation;
   for this, we know, was the design of sacrifices--that men who were
   polluted might reconcile themselves to God. A right answer was then
   given by the priests, that unclean flesh or unclean oil is not
   sanctified by the touch of holy flesh. Why? because the flesh itself
   was not dedicated to God for this end--to purify what was unclean by a
   mere touch. Yet, on the other hand, it is most true, that when a man
   was unclean he polluted whatever he touched. It is commonly thought,
   that he is said to be unclean in his soul who had defiled himself by
   touching a corpse; but I differ from this. The word soul is often taken
   in the law for man himself.--

   The soul that eats of what died of itself is polluted;
   the soul that touches a corpse is polluted.'
   (Leviticus 17:15.)

   Hence he is here said to be polluted in his soul, who had an outward
   uncleanness, as we say in French, Pollu en sa personne. Whosoever then
   is unclean pollutes by touch only whatever might have been otherwise
   clean; and the conclusion sufficiently proves that this is the purport
   of this passage. [149] I have said enough of what the design of the
   Prophet is, but the subject must be more fully explained.

   We know how heedlessly men are wont to deal with God; for they trifle
   with him like children with their puppets. And this presumption has
   been condemned, as it is well known, even by heathens. Hardly a Prophet
   could have inveighed more severely against this gross superstition than
   Persius, who compares sacrifices, so much thought of by all, to
   puppets, and shows that other things are required by God, even

   A well ordered condition and piety of soul, and an inward purity
   of mind, and a heart imbued with generous virtue. [150]

   He means then that men ought to be imbued with true holiness, and that
   inwardly, so that there should be nothing fictitious or feigned. He
   says that they who are such, that is, who have imbibed the true fear of
   God, do rightly serve him, thought they may bring only a crumb of
   incense, and that others only profane the worship of God, though they
   may bring many oxen; for whatever they think avails to cover their
   filth is polluted by new and repeated filth. And this is what has been
   expressed by heathen authors: another poet says, -

   An impious right hand does not rightly worship the celestials. [151]

   So they spoke according to the common judgement of natural knowledge.
   As to the Philosophers, they ever hold this principle--that no
   sacrifice is rightly offered to God except the mind be right and pure.
   But yet the Philosophers, as well as the Poets, adopted this false
   notion, by which Satan beguiled all men, from the least to the
   greatest--that God is pacified by ceremonies: hence have proceeded so
   many expiations, in which foolish men trusted, and by which they
   thought that God would be propitious to them, thought they obstinately
   continued daily to procure for themselves new punishments, and, as it
   were, avowedly to carry on war with God himself.

   They admit at this day, under the Papacy, this principle that the true
   fear of God is necessary, as hypocrisy contaminates all the works of
   men; nor will they indeed dare to commend those who seek feignedly and
   triflingly to satisfy God, when they are filled with pride, contempt,
   and impiety. And yet they will never receive what the Prophet says
   here--that men not only lose all their labor, but also contract new
   pollution, when they seek to pacify God by their sacrifices,
   unaccompanied by inward purity. For whence is that partial
   righteousness which the Papists imagine? For they say, that if one does
   not keep the whole law, yet obedience in part is approved by God; and
   nothing is more common among them than this expression, partial
   righteousness. If then an adulterer refrains from theft, and lays out
   in alms some of his wealth, they will have this to be charity, and
   declare it to be acceptable. Though it proceeds from an unclean man, it
   is yet made a covering, which is deemed sufficient in some way or
   another to pacify God. Thus the Papists seek, without exercising any
   discrimination, to render God bound to them by their works, though they
   may be full of all uncleanness. We hence see that this error has not
   sprung up today or yesterday for the first time; but it is inherent in
   the bones and marrows of men; for they have ever thought that their
   services please God, though they may be unclean themselves.

   Hence this definition must be borne in mind--that works, however
   splendid they may appear before our eyes, are of no value or importance
   before God, except they flow from a pure heart. Augustine has very
   wisely explained this in his fourth book against Julia. He says, that
   it would be an absurd thing for the faithful to judge of works by the
   outward appearance; but that they ought to be estimated according to
   the fountain from which they proceed, and also according to their
   design. Now the fountain of works I consider to be integrity of heart,
   and the design or end is, when the object of men is to obey God and to
   consecrate their life to him. Hence then we learn the difference
   between good and evil works, between vices and virtues, that is, from
   the inward state of the mind, and from the object in view. This is the
   subject of the Prophet in the first clause; and he drew an answer from
   the priests, which was wholly consistent with the law; and it amounted
   to this, that no work, however praised and applauded by the world, is
   valued before God's tribunal, except it proceeds from a pure heart.

   Now as to the second part, it is no less difficult to convince men of
   its truth--that whatever they touch is contaminated, when they are
   themselves unclean; and yet this is what God had plainly made known to
   the Jews: and the priests hesitated not nor doubted, but immediately
   returned an answer, as though the matter was well known--that an
   unclean man contaminates whatever thing he touches. But when we come to
   apply the subject, men then reject what they had been clearly taught;
   nay, what they are forced to confess, until they see the matter brought
   home to them, and then they begin to accuse God of too much rigour:
   "Why is this, that whatever we touch is polluted, though we might leave
   some defilement? Are not our works still deserving of some praise, as
   they are good works?" And hence also is the common saying, That works,
   which are in their kind good, are always in a measure meritorious, and
   though they are without faith, they yet avail to merit the gift of
   faith, inasmuch as they are in themselves praiseworthy, as chastity,
   liberality, sobriety, temperance, beneficence, and all alms giving. But
   God declares that these virtues are polluted, though men may admire
   them, and that they are only abominable filth, except the heart be
   really cleansed and purified. Why so? because nothing can flow from an
   impure and polluted fountain but what is impure and polluted.

   It is now easy to understand how suitably the Prophet had led the
   priests and the whole people to see this difference. For if he had
   abruptly said this to them--that no work pleased God, except the doer
   himself had been cleansed from every defilement, there would have
   arisen immediately many disputations: "Why will God reject what is in
   itself worthy of praise? When one observes chastity, when another
   liberally lays out a part of his property, when a third devotes himself
   wholly to promote the good of the public, when magnanimity and firmness
   shine forth in one, when another cultivates the liberal arts--are not
   these such virtues as deserve some measure of praise!" Thus a great
   glamour would have been raised among the people, had not Haggai made
   this kind of preface--that according to the law what is unclean is not
   sanctified by the touch of holy flesh, and also that whatever is
   touched by an unclean person is polluted. What the law then prescribed
   in its rituals silenced all those clamours, which might have
   immediately arisen among the people. Moreover, though ceremonies have
   now ceased and are no longer in use, yet what God has once declared
   still retains its force--that whatever we touch is polluted by us,
   except there be a real purity of heart to sanctify our works.

   Let us now inquire how our works please God: for no one is ever found
   to be pure and perfect, as the most perfect are defiled with some
   vices; so that their works are always sprinkled with some spots and
   blemishes, and contract some uncleanness from the hidden filth of their
   hearts. In answer to this, I say first, that all our works are corrupt
   before God and abominable in his sight, for the heart is naturally
   corrupt: but when God purifies our hearts by faith, then our works
   begin to be approved, and obtain praise before him; for the heart is
   cleansed by faith, and purity is diffused over our works, so that they
   begin to be pleasing to God. For this reason Moses says, that Abel
   pleased God with his sacrifices,

   "The Lord had respect to Abel and to his gifts."
   (Genesis 4:4.)

   Had Moses said only, that the sacrifices of Abel were approved by God,
   he would have spoken unadvisedly, or at least obscurely; for he would
   have been silent on the main thing. But he begins with the person, as
   though he had said, that Abel pleased God, because he worshipped him
   with an upright and sincere heart. He afterwards adds, that his
   sacrifices were approved, for they proceeded from the true fear of God
   and sincere piety. So Paul, when speaking of the real keeping of the
   law, says, that the end of the law is love from a pure heart and faith
   unfeigned. (1 Timothy 1:5.) He shows then that no work is deemed right
   before God, except it proceeds from that fountain, even faith
   unfeigned, which is always connected with an upright and sincere heart.
   This is one thing.

   Secondly, we must bear in mind how God purifies our hearts by faith.
   There is indeed a twofold purification: He first forms us in his image,
   and engraves on us true and real fear, and an obedient disposition.
   This purity of the heart diffuses itself over our works; for when we
   are imbued with true piety, we have no other object but to offer
   ourselves and all we have to God. Far indeed are they who are
   hypocrites and profane men from having this feeling; nay, they are
   wholly alienated from it: they offer liberally their own things to God,
   but they wish to be their own masters; for a hypocrite will never give
   up himself as a spiritual sacrifice to God. We hence see how faith
   purifies our hearts, and also purifies our works: for having been
   regenerated by the Spirit of God, we offer to him first ourselves and
   then all that we have. But as this purgation is never found complete in
   man, it is therefore necessary that there should come an aid from
   gratuitous acceptance. Our hearts then are purified by faith, because
   God imputes not to us that uncleanness which remains, and which defiles
   our works. As then God regards with gracious acceptance that purity
   which is not as yet perfect, so he causes that its contagion should not
   reach to our works. When Abel offered sacrifices to God, he was indeed
   perfect, inasmuch as there was nothing feigned or hypocritical in him:
   but he was a man, we know, encompassed with infirmity. It was therefore
   necessary for his remaining pollution to have been purified by the
   grace of Christ. Hence it was that his sacrifices were accepted: for as
   he was accepted, so God graciously received whatever proceeded from
   him.

   We now then see how men, while in a state of nature, displease God by
   their works, and can bring nothing but what is corrupt, filthy, and
   abominable. We farther see how the children of God, after having been
   renewed by his Spirit, come pure to him and offer him pure sacrifices:
   they come pure, because it is their object to devote themselves to God
   without any dissimulation; but as this devotedness is never perfect,
   God supplies the defect by a gratuitous imputation, for he embraces
   them as his servants in the same manner as though they were entirely
   formed in all righteousness. And in the same way he approves of their
   works, for all their spots are wiped away, yea, those very spots, which
   might justly prevent all favor; were not all uncleanness washed away by
   the blood of Christ, and that through faith.

   We hence learn, that there is no ground for any one to deceive himself
   with vain delusions, by attempting to please God with great pomp: for
   the first thing of which the Prophet treats here is always required,
   that is, that a person must be pure in his heart, that inward purity
   must precede every work. And though this truth meets us everywhere in
   all the Prophets, yet as hypocrisy dazzles our eyes and blinds all our
   senses, it ought to be seriously considered by us; and we ought to
   notice in an especial manner not only this passage but other similar
   passages where the Prophets ridicule the solicitude of the people, when
   they busied themselves with sacrifices and outward observances, and
   neglected the principal thing--real purity of heart.

   We must also take notice of what the Prophet says in the last verse,
   that so was every work of their hand and whatever they offered [152] It
   seems apparently a hard matter, that the very sacrifices were condemned
   as polluted. But it is no wonder that fictitious modes of worship, by
   which profane men dishonor God, should be repudiated by him; for they
   seek to transform him according to their own fancy, as though he might
   be soothed by playthings or such trifles. It is therefore a most
   disgraceful mockery when men deal thus with God, offering him only
   external ceremonies, and disregarding his nature: for they make no
   account of spiritual worship, and yet think that they please him. We
   must then, in a word, make this remark--that the Prophet teaches us
   here, that it is not enough for men to show obedience to God, to offer
   sacrifices, to spend labor in building the Temple, except these things
   were rightly done--and how rightly? by a sincere heart, so there should
   be no dissimulation, no duplicity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [148] This clause is literally rendered by Newcome--"Ask now the law
   from the priests;" or, according to the order of the words, "Ask now
   from the priests the law."--Ed.

   [149] The words are [tm'-nphs], polluted of soul, or polluted soul.
   When pollution by a carcase or a dead body is meant, the preposition
   [l] is put before [nphs]. See Numbers 5:2; 9:6,7,10. A polluted person
   seems to be intended here, without any reference to the way in which he
   became so; and this is sufficient for the purpose of the Prophet.
   Theodoret takes this sense--akatharton tina--"an unclean person." But
   most agree with our version; so do Jerome, Dathius, Newcome, Henderson,
   and others--"the polluted by a dead body."--Ed.

   [152] The literal rendering of the verse would be as follows,-- Then
   answered Haggai and said, --
   Such is this people and such is this nation,
   Before me, saith Jehovah;
   Yea, such is every work of their hands,
   And what they offer there, polluted it is. The Prophet seems to have
   pointed to the altar on which they offered their sacrifices, when he
   says, "What they offer there." Both Newcome and Henderson are evidently
   wrong in rendering the passage in the past tense. The last verb is
   future, used, as it is often, as a present. So we render it in Welsh,
   yr hyn a aberthant yna; but we understand it as a present act. We may
   notice here what is often the character of the Prophetic style; the two
   last lines explain more particularly what the two first contain.--Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as we come from our mother's womb
   wholly impure and polluted, and afterwards continually contract so many
   new defilements,--O grant that we may flee to the fountain, which alone
   can cleanse us. And as there is no other way by which we can be
   cleansed from all the defilements of the flesh, except we be sprinkled
   by the blood of thy only begotten Son, and that by the hidden power of
   thy Spirit, and thus renounce all our vices,--O grant that we may so
   strive truly and sincerely to devote ourselves to thee, as daily to
   renounce more and more all our evil affections, and to have nothing
   else as our object, but to submit our minds and all our affections to
   thee, by really denying ourselves, and to exercise ourselves in this
   strenuous effort as long as we are in this world, until we attain to
   that true and perfect purity, which is laid up for us in thine
   only-begotten Son, when we shall be fully united to him, having been
   transformed into that glory into which he has been received. Amen.

   Haggai 2:15-19

   15. And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before
   a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:

   15. Et nunc ponite quaeso (vel, agedum) super cor vestrum a die hac et
   supra, antequam poneretur lapis super lapidem in templo Iehovae:

   16. Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures,
   there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty
   vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.

   16. Ante haec quum veniret quis ad acervum viginti, fuit decem; quum
   veniret ad torcular ut hauriret quinquaginta e torculari, fuit summa
   viginti.

   17. I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the
   labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.

   17. Percussi vos orientali vento (vel, urente) et rubigene, et grandine
   in omni opere manuum vestrarum (alii vertunt, et omne opus, sed male,
   et potius hic debet resolvi quemadmodum dictum est, in omni ergo opere)
   et vos non ad me, dicit lehova.

   18. Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth
   day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the
   LORD'S temple was laid, consider it

   18. Ponite quaeso super cor vestrum a die hac et supra, a die vicesimo
   quarto noni mensis, a die quo fundatum fuit templum Iehovae, ponite
   super cor vestrum.

   19. Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig
   tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth:
   from this day will I bless you

   19. An adhuc semen in horreo? et adhuc vitis, et ficus, et
   malusgranata, et arbor olivae non protulit; a die hac benedicam vobis.

   I am under the necessity of joining all these verses together, for the
   Prophet treats of the same thing: and the import of the whole is
   this--that the Lord had then openly punished the tardiness of the
   people, so that every one might have easily known that they acted very
   inconsistently in attending only to their private concerns, so as to
   neglect the Temple. The Prophet indeed speaks here in a homely manner
   to earthly men, addicted to their own appetites: had they really become
   wiser, or made greater progress in true religion, he might have
   addressed them differently, and would have no doubt followed the rule
   mentioned by Paul,

   We speak wisdom among those who are perfect.'
   (1 Corinthians 2:6.)

   But as they had their thoughts fixed on meat and drink, and were intent
   on their private advantages, the Prophet tells them what they could
   comprehend that God was angry with them, and that the proofs of his
   curse were evident, as the earth did not produce fruit, and they
   themselves were reduced to want. We hence perceive the object of the
   Prophet: but I shall run over the words, that the subject may become
   more evident.

   Lay it, he says, on your heart. Here the Prophet indirectly condemns
   their insensibility, as they were blind in things quite manifest; for
   he does not here direct their thoughts to heaven, nor announce deep
   mysteries, but only speaks of food and daily support. Since God, then,
   impressed clear marks of his wrath on their common sustenance, it was
   an intolerable stupidity in them to disregard these. And the Prophet
   often repeats the same thing, in order to shame the Jews; for their
   tardiness being so often reproved, ought to have made them ashamed. Lay
   it on the heart, he says; that is, Consider what I am going to say;
   from this day and heretofore, [153] he says, before a stone was laid on
   a stone; that is, from that day when I began to exhort you to build the
   Temple, consider what has happened to this very day.

   Then he adds, Before ye began, he says, to build the Temple, was it not
   that every one who came to a heap of twenty measures found only ten?
   that is, was it not, that when the husband men expected that there
   would be twenty measures in the storehouse or on the floor, they were
   disappointed? because God had dried up the ears, so they yielded not
   what they used to do; for husband men, by long experience, can easily
   conjecture what they may expect when they see the gathered harvest; but
   this prospect had disappointed the husband men. God, then, had in this
   case given proofs of his curse. Farther; when any one came to the vat,
   and expected a large vintage, had he not also been disappointed? for
   instead of fifty casks he found only twenty.

   He afterwards adds, I have smitten you with the east wind: for sdphvn,
   shidafun, is to be taken for a scorching wind; and the east wind proved
   injurious to Judea by its dryness. So also yrqvn, irkun, is mildew, or
   a moist wind, from which mildew proceeds; for we know that corn, when
   it has much wet, contracts mildew when the sun emits its heat. As to
   the meaning of the Prophet there is no ambiguity, for he intended to
   teach them that they were in various ways visited, that they might
   clearly perceive that God was displeased with them. He then mentions
   the hail: for when famine happens only from the cold or from the heat,
   it may be ascribed to chance or to the stars: but when God employs
   various scourges, we are then constrained to acknowledge his wrath, as
   though he were determined to awaken us. This is the reason why the
   Prophet records here various kinds of judgements. And he says, In every
   work of your hands. Some read, And every work, etc., which is improper;
   for they were not smitten in their own bodies, but in the produce of
   the earth. Then he adds, And you returned not to me, that is, "During
   the whole of that time I effected nothing, while I was so often and in
   such various ways chastising you. And yet what good has the obduracy of
   your hearts done you? ye have not returned to me."

   Lay it, he says, on your heart from this day, and heretofore, etc. He
   repeats what he had said, even from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth
   month. We have seen before, that the Prophet was sent on that day to
   reprove the people for their sins. Lay it then on your heart, he says,
   from this day, etc. We see how emphatical is this repetition, because
   in things evident the Jews were so insensible that their want and
   famine could not touch them: and we know that there is no sharper goad
   to stimulate men than famine. Since then the Lord snatched away their
   food from their mouth, and they remained inattentive to such a
   judgement, it was a sure evidence of extreme stupidity. It is on this
   account that the Prophet often declares, that the Jews were extremely
   insensible; for they did not consider the judgements of God, which were
   so manifest. He now subjoins, Is there yet seed in the barn? Jerome
   reads, in the bud; and the probable reason why he thus rendered the
   word was, that he thought that the clauses would not correspond without
   giving the meaning of bud to mgvrh, megure; but, as I think, he was
   mistaken. The Hebrews propose what I cannot approve, for some of them
   read the sentence as an affirmation, For there is seed in the barn;
   because they dared not to commit the seed to the ground in their state
   of want. And others read it as a question, as though he had said, that
   the time of harvest was far off, and that what they had remaining was
   so small that it was not enough to support them. But, in my judgement,
   the seed refers not to what had been gathered, but to what had been
   sown. I therefore doubt not but that he speaks of God's blessing on the
   harvest which was to come after five months, to which I shall presently
   refer. Some, indeed, render the words in the past tense, as though the
   Prophet had said, that the Jews had already experienced how great the
   curse of God was; but this is a forced view. The real meaning of the
   Prophet is this, Is there yet seed in the barn? that is, Is the seed,
   as yet hid in the ground, gathered?

   He then adds affirmatively, neither the vine, nor the fig tree, nor the
   pomegranate, nor the olive had yet produced any thing; for it was the
   ninth month of the year; and the beginning of the year, we know, was in
   the month of March. Though then they were nearly in the midst of
   winter, they remained uncertain as to what the produce would be. In the
   month of November no opinion could be formed, even by the most
   skillful, what produce they were to expect. As then they were still in
   suspense, the Prophet says, that God's blessing was in readiness for
   them. What he had in view was, to show that he brought a sure message
   from God; for he speaks not of a vintage the prospect of which had
   already appeared, nor of a harvest when the ears had already made their
   appearance. As then there was still danger from the hail, from
   scorching winds, and also from rains and other things injurious to
   fruit and produce of the land, he says, that the harvest would be most
   abundant, the vintage large, that, in a word, the produce of the olive
   and the fig tree would be most exuberant. The truth of the prophecy
   might now be surely known, when God fulfilled what he had spoken by the
   mouth of his servant. I now return to the subject itself

   As I have before observed, the Prophet deals with the Jews here
   according to their gross disposition: for he might in a more refined
   manner have taught the godly, who were not so entangled with, or
   devoted to, earthly concerns. It was then necessary for him to speak in
   a manner suitable to the comprehension of the people, as a skillful
   teacher who instructs children and those of riper age in a different
   manner. And he shows by evidences that the Jews were unthankful to God,
   for they neglected the building of the Temple, and every one was
   diligently and earnestly engaged in building his own house. He shows by
   proofs their conduct,--How? Whence has it happened, he says, that at
   one time your fruit has been destroyed by mildew, at another by heat,
   and then by the hail, except that the Lord intended thus to correct
   your neglect? It then follows, that you are convicted of ingratitude by
   these judgements; for you have neglected God's worship, and only
   pursued your own private advantages. This is one thing.

   The latter clause contains a promise; and by it the instruction given
   was more confirmed, when the people saw that things suddenly and
   unexpectedly took a better turn. They had been for many years
   distressed with want of sustenance; but, when fruitfulness of a sudden
   followed, did not this change manifest something worthy of their
   consideration? especially when it was foretold before it happened, and
   before any such thing could have been foreseen by human conjectures? We
   see then, that the Prophet dwells on two things,--he condemns the Jews
   for their neglect, and proves that they were impious and ungrateful
   towards God, for they disregarded the building of the Temple; and them,
   in order to animate them and render them more active in the work they
   had begun, he sets before them, as I have said, what had taken place.
   God had, indeed, abundantly testified, by various kinds of punishment
   that he was displeased with them: but when he now promises that he
   would deal differently with them, there hence arises a new and a
   stronger evidence.

   But someone may here raise an objection and say, that these evidences
   are not sure or unvaried; since it often happens, that when people
   devote themselves faithfully to the service of God they are pressed
   down by adverse events; yea, that God very often designedly tries their
   faith by withholding from them for a time his blessing. But the answer
   to this may be readily given: I indeed allow that it often happens that
   those who sincerely and from the heart serve God, are deprived of
   earthly blessings, because God intends to elevate their minds to the
   hope of eternal reward. God then designedly withdraws his blessing
   often from the faithful, that they may hunger and thirst in this world;
   as though they lost all their labor in serving him. But it was not the
   Prophet's design to propound here an evidence of an unvarying
   character, as he counted it sufficient to convince the Jews by
   experience, that nothing prevented them from acknowledging that their
   avarice displeased God, except their extreme stupidity. The Prophet
   then does here reprove their insensibility; for, while they greatly
   labored in enriching themselves, they did not observe that their labor
   was in vain, because God from heaven poured his curse on them. This
   then might have been easily known by them had they not hardened
   themselves in their vices. And what the Prophet testifies here
   respecting the fruitful produce of wine, and corn, and oil, and of
   other things, was still, as I have said, a stronger confirmation.

   Now, if any one objects again and says--that this was of no value,
   because a servile and mercenary service does not please God: to this I
   answer--that God does often by such means stimulate men, when he sees
   them to be extremely tardy and slothful, and that he afterwards leads
   them by other means to serve him truly and from the heart. When
   therefore any one obeys God, only that he may satisfy his appetite, it
   is as though one labored from day to day for the sake of wages, and
   then disregards him by whom he has been hired. It is certain that such
   a service is counted as nothing before God; but he would have himself
   to be generously worshipped by us; and he loves, as Paul says, a
   cheerful giver. (2 Corinthians 9:7.) But as men, for the most part, on
   account of their ignorance, cannot be led at first to this generous
   state of mind, so as to devote themselves willingly to God, it is
   necessary to begin by using other means, as the Prophet does here, who
   promises earthly and daily sustenance to the Jews, for he saw that they
   could not immediately, at the first step, ascend upwards to heaven; but
   it was not his purpose to stop short, until he elevated their minds
   higher. Let us then know, that this was only the beginning, that they
   might learn to fear God and to expect whatever they wanted from his
   blessing, and also that they might shake off their stupor, under which
   they had previously labored. In short, God deals in one way with the
   rude and ignorant, who are not yet imbued with true religion; and he
   deals in another way with his own disciples, who are instructed in
   sound doctrine. When I say that the Prophet acted thus towards the
   Jews, I speak not of the whole nation; but I regard what we have
   observed at the beginning of this book--that the Jews cared for nothing
   then but to build their own houses, and that there was no zeal for
   religion among them. As then the recollection of God was nigh buried
   among them, the Temple being neglected, and every one's anxiety being
   concentrated in building his own house, we hence learn how grossly
   earthly their affections were. It is therefore no wonder that the
   Prophet treated them in the manner stated here. Let us proceed -

   [153] Supra, [mlh]; "upward," Newcome; "backward," Henderson;
   "forward," Secker. The last refers to 1 Samuel 16:13, and 30:25, as the
   only places besides here and in verse 18, where it is applied to time:
   and clearly in Samuel it means "forward," or hereafter. It means the
   same when applied to age, Numbers 1:20, and when applied to place,
   Deuteronomy 28:43 If we retain this meaning, we must consider this
   verse, and its repetition in verse 18, as the commencement of a
   sentence, which is completed at the end of verse 19, as intervening
   clauses. Then the passage would be as follows-- 15. And now take, I
   pray, notice;
   From this day and forward,
   From the time of setting a stone on a stone
   In the Temple of Jehovah, 16. From the time you came to a heap of
   twenty,
   And it was ten,
   And came to the vat to draw fifty measures,
   And there were twenty; 17. I smote you with blight, and with mildew,
   And with hail, even all the work of your hands;
   But ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah;-- 18. Take, I pray, notice;
   From this day and forward,
   From the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month,
   From the day in which was founded
   The Temple of Jehovah;--take notice; 19. Is yet the seed in the
   granary?--
   And as yet the vine and the fig tree,
   And the pomegranate and the olive, it hath not borne;--
   From this day will I bless you. I prefer "Take notice," or, "mark," to
   "consider," as the meaning of [lvvkm symv], "set or fix your heart." In
   favor of "your" instead of "their" in verse 16, there are three MSS.;
   and it is more consistent with the context. The expression literally
   is, "From your being to come," i.e from the time in which you came, and
   found out the deficiency. "Fifty measures;" [phvrh] is rendered by the
   Septuagint metretas--"baths;" by Jerome, "Lagenas--flagons." The word
   means here evidently a vessel to measure the wine from the vat; what
   quantity it contained is not known. It is here in the singular number,
   while the numeral, "fifty," is in the plural; deugain, which literally
   in English is, "ten measure and forty." In verse 17, "even all the work
   of your hands," is in apposition with "you," and explanatory of it,
   according to what we often find in the Prophets; for by "you" was meant
   their "work," and not themselves personally. "But ye turned not to me,"
   literally, "But ye not to me;" perhaps the meaning is, "Ye ascribed it
   not to me," that is, the judgment previously mentioned, or, "Ye
   attended not to me:" but the verb [svtm] is commonly thought to be
   understood. See Amos 4:9. The question in verse 19 is to be taken
   negatively, to correspond with the negative declaration in what
   follows.--Ed.

   Haggai 2:20-23

   20. And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and
   twentieth day of the month, saying,

   20. Et fuit (postea fuit) sermo Iehovae secundo ad Chaggai vicesimo
   quarto mensis, dicendo,

   21. Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the
   heavens and the earth;

   21. Dic ad Zerubbabel, ducens Iehudah, dicendo, Ego concutiam coelos et
   terram;

   22. And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the
   strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the
   chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders
   shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.

   22. Et evertam solium regnorum, et perdam robur regnorum gentium; et
   evertam quadrigam et sessores ejus evertam quadrigam et sessores ejus;
   et descendent equi et sessores eorum, quisque in gladio fratris sui.

   23. In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O
   Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will
   make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.

   23. In die illa, dicit Iehova exercituum, sumam te Zerubbabel, fili
   Sealtiel, serve mi, dicit Iehova; et ponam to quasi annulum, quia elegi
   te, dicit Iehova exercituum.

   The Prophet now proceeds still farther; for there is here a really
   gratuitous and spiritual promise, by which God affirms that he will
   have a care for his people to the end. He does not now speak of wine
   and corn, in order to feed the hungry; but he shows that he would be an
   eternal Father to that people; for he could not and would not forget
   the covenant he made with their fathers. There is no doubt but he
   points out Christ in the person of Zerubbabel, as we shall presently
   see. So that it is right to distinguish this prophecy from the last;
   for God has before shown, that the worship which the Jews had for a
   time disregarded was pleasing to him, as a reward was in readiness, and
   also that he was offended with the negligence previously reproved, as
   he had inflicted manifest punishment, not once, nor for a short time,
   but for many years, and in various ways. What then does follow? In this
   second prophecy he addresses Zerubbabel, and promises to be a Savior to
   the people under his authority.

   With regard to these words, some think that a continued act is
   signified when he says, I shake the heavens and the earth; and they
   give this explanation--That though it belongs to me to shake the heaven
   and the earth, and I am wont to subvert kingdoms, yet I will render
   firm the sacred kingdom which I have raised among my people. But this
   view is very frigid: and we see even from this chapter what is meant by
   the shaking of the heaven and of the earth, of which mention is made.
   The Apostle also rightly interprets this passage, when he teaches us,
   that this prophecy properly belongs to the kingdom of Christ. (Hebrews
   12:26.) There is therefore no doubt, but that the Prophet means here
   something special, when he introduces God as saying, Behold, I shake
   the heavens and the earth. God then does not speak of his ordinary
   providence, nor simply claim to himself the government of the heaven
   and of the earth, nor teach us that he raises on high the humble and
   the low, and also brings down the high and the elevated; but he
   intimates, that he has some memorable work in contemplation, which,
   when done, would shake men with fear, and make heaven and earth to
   tremble. Hence, the Prophet no doubt intended here to lead the Jews to
   the hope of that redemption, some prelude of which God had then given
   them; but its fullness could not as yet be seen--nay, it was hid from
   the view of men: for who could have expected such a renovation of the
   world as was effected by the coming of Christ? When the Jews found
   themselves exposed to the wrongs of all men, when so small a number
   returned, and there was no kingdom and no power, they thought
   themselves to have been as it were deceived. Hence the Prophet affirms
   here, that there would be a wonderful work of God, which would shake
   the heaven and the earth. It is therefore necessary that this should be
   applied to Christ; for it was, as it were, a new creation of the world,
   when Christ gathered together the things scattered, as the Apostle
   says, in the heaven and in the earth. (Colossians 1:20.) When he
   reconciled men to God and to angels, when he conquered the devil and
   restored life to the dead, when he shone forth with his own
   righteousness, then indeed God shook the heaven and the earth; and he
   still shakes them at this day, when the gospel is preached; for he
   forms anew the children of Adam after his own image. This spiritual
   regeneration then is such an evidence of God's power and grace, that he
   may justly be said to shake the heaven and the earth. The import of the
   passage is, that it behaved the Jews to form a conception in their
   minds of something greater than could be seen by their eyes; for their
   redemption was not yet completed.

   Hence he subjoins--I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; I will
   destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will
   overthrow the chariot and him who sits in it; come down shall the
   horses and their riders; every one shall fall by the sword of his
   brother. He confirms here the former sentence--that nothing would be an
   hindrance that God should not renew his Church. And rightly he adds
   this by way of anticipation; for the Jews were surrounded on all sides
   by inveterate enemies; they had as many enemies as they had neighbors;
   and they were hated even by the whole world. How then could they emerge
   into that dignity which was then promised to them, except God
   overturned the rest of the world? But the Prophet here meets this
   objection, and briefly shows that God would rather that all the nations
   should perish, than that his Church should remain in that dishonorable
   state. We then see that the Prophet here means no other thing then that
   God would overcome all those impediments, which Satan and the whole
   world may throw in the way, when it is his purpose to restore his
   Church.

   We now perceive the Prophet's designs, and we also perceive the
   application of his doctrine. For whenever impediments and difficulties
   come in our way, calculated to drive us to despair, when we think of
   the restoration of the Church, this prophecy ought to come to our
   minds, which shows that it is in God's power, and that it is his
   purpose to overturn all the kingdoms of the earth, to break chariots in
   pieces, to cast down and lay prostrate all riders, rather then to allow
   them to prevent the restoration of his Church.

   But in the last verse the Prophet shows why God would do this--even
   that Zerubbabel might prosper together with the whole people. Hence he
   says--In that day saith Jehovah, I will take thee, Zerubbabel, and will
   set thee as a signet, for I have chosen thee. As we have before said,
   God addresses Zerubbabel here, that in his person he might testify that
   he would bless the people whom he intended to gather under that sacred
   leader; for though Zerubbabel never had a kingdom, nor ever wore a
   crown, he was yet of the tribe of Judah; and God designed that some
   spark of that kingdom should exist, which he had raised in the family
   of David. Since, then, Zerubbabel was at that time a type of Christ,
   God declares here that he would be to him as a signet--that is, that
   his dignity would be esteemed by him. This comparison of a signet is
   found also in other places. It is said in Jeremiah 22:24--"Though this
   Coniah were a signet on my right hand I would pluck him thence." But
   here God says that Zerubbabel would be to him a signet--that is, Thou
   shalt be with me in high esteem. For a sealing signet is wont to be
   carefully preserved, as kings seek in this way to secure to themselves
   the highest authority, so that more trust may be placed in their seal
   than in the greatest princes. The meaning, then, of the similitude is,
   that Zerubbabel, though despised by the world, was yet highly esteemed
   by God. But it is evident that this was never fulfilled in the person
   of Zerubbabel. It hence follows that it is to be applied to Christ.
   God, in short, shows, that people gathered under one head would be
   accepted by him; for Christ was at length to rise, as it is evident,
   from the seed of Zerubbabel.

   But this reason is to be especially noticed--Because I have chosen
   thee. For God does not here ascribe excellencies or merits to
   Zerubbabel, when he says that he would hold him in great esteem; but he
   attributes this to his own election. If, then, the reason be asked why
   God had so much exalted Zerubbabel, and bestowed on him favors so
   illustrious, it can be found in nothing else but in the goodness of God
   alone. God had made a covenant with David, and promised that his
   kingdom would be eternal; hence it was that he chose Zerubbabel after
   the people had returned from exile; and this election was the reason
   why God exalted Zerubbabel, though his power at that time was but
   small. We indeed know that he was exposed to the contempt of all
   nations; but God invites here the attention of the faithful to their
   election, so that they might hope for more than what the perception of
   the flesh could conceive or apprehend; for what he has decreed cannot
   be made void; and in the person of Zerubbabel he had determined to save
   a chosen people; for from him, as it has been said, Christ was to come.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are still restrained by our earthly
   cares, and cannot ascend upward to heaven with so much readiness and
   alacrity as we ought--O grant, that since thou extendest to us daily so
   liberal a supply for the present life, we may at least learn that thou
   art our Father, and that we may not at the same time fix our thoughts
   on these perishable things, but learn to elevate our minds higher, and
   so make continual advances in thy spiritual service, until at length we
   come to the full and complete fruition of that blessed and celestial
   life which thou hast promised to us, and procured for us by the blood
   of thy only begotten Son. Amen.

   CALVIN'S VERSION of

   THE BOOK OF HABAKKUK.
     __________________________________________________________________

   chapter 1

   1 the burden which Habakkuk the Prophet saw:

   2 How long, Jehovah, shall I cry, And thou wilt not hear? And cry aloud
   to thee of violence, And thou wilt not save?

   3 Why showest thou me iniquity, And makest me to see trouble? And why
   are violence and plunder in my sight, And he who excites strife and
   contention? (19)

   4 Therefore dissolved is the law, And judgment does not continually go
   forth; For the wicked surrounds the just, Therefore go forth does
   perverted judgment. (21)

   5 Look ye among the Gentiles and see, And be astonished, be astonished;
   For a work will I work in your days, Which ye will not believe, though
   it be told you:

   6 For behold, I will rouse the Chaldeans--A nation bitter and hasty,
   Which shall march through the breadths of the earth, To possess
   habitations not its own:

   7 Terrible and fearful shall it be, From itself shall its judgment and
   its dignity proceed:

   8 And swifter than leopards shall be its horses, And fiercer than the
   evening wolves; And numerous shall be its horsemen; And its horsemen
   from far shall come, They shall fly as an eagle hastening to devour:
   (30)

   9 The whole of it for booty shall come; The aspect of their faces will
   be like the east-wind; And he will gather captives like the sand:

   10 And at kings he will laugh, And princes shall be a scorn to him:
   Every fortress he will scorn, He will gather dust and take it:

   11 Then will he change his spirit, And pass through and act impiously,
   Ascribing this his power to his god. (37)

   12 Art not thou, Jehovah, from the beginning, my God? My holy One! we
   shall not die: Thou, Jehovah, for judgment hast set him; And thou
   strong One, for correction hast established him.

   13 Pure art thou of eyes, so as not to behold evil, And on trouble thou
   canst not look:--Why lookest thou on transgressors, And takest no
   notice, when the ungodly devours One more righteous than himself?

   14 Thou makest man like the fish of the sea, Like the reptile, which is
   without a leader: (46)

   15 The whole by his hook will he draw up, Collect into his drag, and
   gather into his net; He will therefore rejoice and exult: (48)

   16 Hence sacrifice will he to his drag, And incense will he offer to
   his net; For through them fat will be his portion, And his meat will be
   rich.--

   17 Shall he therefore extend his drag, And continue to slay the
   nations, so as not to spare them?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 On my watch-tower will I stand, And set myself on a citadel; And I
   will watch to see what he may say to me, And what I may answer to the
   reproof given me.

   2 Then answer me did Jehovah and said, Write the vision, and make it
   plain on tables, That run may he who reads it;

   3 For yet the vision shall be for an appointed time, And will speak at
   the end, and will not deceive: If it tarry, wait for it; (66) for
   coming it will come, and will not delay.

   4 Behold the elated! not right is his soul within him; But the just, by
   his faith, shall he live." (72)

   5 Yea, truly! as by wine, transgress does the proud man, And he will
   not rest; (87) For he enlarges as the grave his soul, And is like to
   death, and is not satisfied; Yea, he collects to himself all nations,
   And heaps together for himself all the people.

   6 Shall not all these take up against him a parable, And against him an
   enigmatical taunt, and say,--"Ho! he multiplies what is not his own!
   how long! And he accumulates on himself thick clay!

   7 Shall they not suddenly rise up who shall bite thee, And awake, who
   shall torment thee? And shalt not thou become tramplings to them?

   8 As thou has spoiled many nations, Spoil thee shall all the remnant of
   the people, On account of men's blood, and of violence To the land, to
   the city and to all its inhabitants.

   9 Ho! he covets an evil covetousness to his house, In order to set on
   high his nest, That he may keep himself from the hand of evil!

   10 Thou hast provided shame for thine own house, By cutting off many
   nations, And thou hast sinned against thine own soul."

   11 For the stone from the wall shall cry, [154] And the wood from the
   chamber shall answer it,--

   12 "Ho! he builds a town by blood, And sets up a city by iniquity!"

   13 Behold, shall nothing be from Jehovah of hosts? Hence labour shall
   the people in the fire, And weary themselves in vain;

   14 For filled shall be earth with the knowledge of the glory of
   Jehovah, As the waters cover the sea.

   15 Woe to him who gives his friend drink!--Uniting thy heat, thou makes
   them also to drink, That thou mayest look on their nakedness. (112)

   16 Thou art filled with shame for the sake of glory; Drink thou also,
   and be thou uncovered: Poured forth to thee shall be the cup of
   Jehovah's right hand, And shameful spewing shall be on thy glory:

   17 For overwhelm thee shall the violence done to Lebanon, And the
   spoiling of beasts, which terrified them; On account of men's blood,
   and of violence To the land, to the city, and to all its inhabitants.

   18 What avails the graven image? For graven it hath its framer, Even
   the molten image and the teacher of falsehood; For trust does the
   framer in his own work, when he makes dumb idols. (122)

   19 Woe to him who saith to wood, "Awake;" And "Arise," to a dumb
   stone;--it will teach: Behold, it is covered with gold and silver; And
   there is no spirit in the midst of it. (124) But Jehovah is in his holy
   Temple: Silent at his presence let the whole earth be.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [154] Calvin makes here a change in the discourse; but the whole to the
   end of the chapter may be viewed as the parable or the taunt mentioned
   in verse 6, and the particle Ho! may be retained instead of Wo. The
   taunt seems to have been formed so as to have been especially suitable
   to be used by the Jews. By regarding the passage in this light, we can
   understand the sudden change of person in verse 16, if the proposed
   emendation be disapproved; for we see the same in the former portions
   of the "taunt." See 6 and 7, and also 9 and 10. That the reader may see
   the whole of this passage, containing the "taunt," in the light in
   which I am now fully inclined to regard it, it shall be presented to
   him complete:-- 6. Will not these, every one of them, Raise up a
   proverb concerning him, And a taunt, enigmas for him, and say,--"Ho! He
   increases what is not his! how long! And he accumulates on himself
   thick clay!-- 7. Will they not suddenly rise up--thy biters, And
   awake--thy tormentors, And thou become booties to them? 8. For thou
   hast spoiled many nation, And spoil thee shall all the remnant of the
   people, On account of men's blood, and of violence To the land, to the
   city, and to all its inhabitants." 9. "Ho! he has coveted an evil
   covetousness to his house, To set on high his nest, In order to save
   himself from the hand of evil!-- 10. Thou hast consulted shame to thine
   house, By cutting off many nations And by sinning against thine own
   soul: 11. For the stone--from the wall it cries, And the beam--from the
   woodwork it answers it,-- 12. Ho! he builds a town by blood, And sets
   up a city by oppression!'-- 13. Shall nothing be, lo! From Jehovah of
   hosts? Yea, labor shall the people for the fire, And nations--for
   vanity shall they weary themselves: 14. For filled shall be the earth
   With the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, Like the waters which
   spread over the sea." 15. "Ho! he gives drink to his neighbour!--Thou
   addest thy bottle and also strong drink, In order to look on their
   nakedness! 16. Thou hast been filled with reproach rather than with
   glory: Drink thou also, and be uncovered; Come round to thee shall the
   cup of the right hand of Jehovah; And shameful spewing shall be on thy
   glory: 17. For the violence done to Lebanon--it shall overwhelm thee,
   And the plunder of beasts--it shall rend thee; On account of men's
   blood, and of violence To the land, to the city, and to all its
   inhabitants." 18. "What avails the graven image! For its graver--he
   forms it--Even the molten image and the teacher of falsehood: Yea,
   trust in it does the former of its form, After having made dumb idols!
   19. Ho! he saith to the wood, Arise, Awake;' To the dumb stone, It will
   teach?' Behold it! covered it is with gold and silver, Yet there is no
   spirit within it! But Jehovah is in his holy temple: Silent at his
   presence let the whole earth be." The "taunt" may be deemed as
   terminating at the end of the 17th verse; but I regard it as continuing
   to the end of the chapter. The word "neighbour," in the 15th verse, is
   a collective singular, meaning every neighbour: hence "their" at the
   end of the verse. The same may be said of "image" in verse 18, which
   means every image or images, as "idols" are mentioned afterwards. Such
   are common instances in the Prophets. "It will teach," in verse 19,
   most evidently refers to "the dumb stone"--the idol; for it is
   expressly called "the teacher of falsehood" in verse 17.--Ed

   CHAPTER 3.

   1 The prayer of Habakkuk the Prophet respecting ignorances:

   2 Jehovah! I heard thy voice, and was terrified; Jehovah! thy work in
   the midst of the years, revive it; In the midst of the years, make it
   known; In wrath thy mercy remember. (137)

   3 God! from Teman he came; And the holy One from mount Paran: Selah:
   Cover the heaven did his glory; Of his praise full was the earth:

   4 And brightness,--as the light it was; Horns,--from his hands they
   were; (143) And there was the hiding of his strength:

   5 Before his face walked the pestilence, And come forth did burning
   coals at his feet:

   6 He stood, and he measured the earth; He looked, and he dissolved
   nations; Yea, shattered were perennial mountains, Bent down were hills
   of antiquity; The ways of ages were his.

   7 For iniquity saw I the tents of Cushan; (150) Tremble did the
   curtains of the land of Midian.

   8 Wert thou angry with rivers, O Jehovah? Was thine indignation against
   rivers? Was thy wrath against the sea? For thou didst ride on thy
   horses, Thy chariots were salvation.

   9 Quite bare was made thy bow: The oaths to the tribes was thy word:
   Selah: (155) With rivers didst thou cleave the earth.

   10 See thee did mountains, they fell down; The stream of waters passed
   away; Utter its voice did the deep, On high did it raise its hands.
   (158)

   11 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation; At the light of
   thy arrows did they proceed, At the brightness of the glittering of thy
   spear. (160)

   12 In wrath didst thou tread on the land, In anger didst thou thresh
   the nations:

   13 Go forth didst thou for the salvation of thy people, For their
   salvation, with thy Christ: Strike didst thou the head from the house
   of the wicked, Making bare the foundation even to the neck: (164)

   14 Smite didst thou with his own staffs the head of his villages: They
   rushed as a whirlwind to drive me away; Their joy was to devour the
   poor in secret:

   15 A way hast thou made in the sea for thy horses, Through the heap of
   great waters. (168)

   16 I heard,--and tremble did my bowels, At thy voice quiver did my
   lips; Enter did rottenness into my bones, And within me I made a great
   noise; That I might rest in the day of affliction, When he ascends
   against the people, Who shall cut them off. (171)

   17 For the fig-tree shall not flourish, And no fruit shall be on the
   vines, Fail shall the produce of the olive, And the fields shall not
   bring forth food; cut off from the fold shall be the flock, And there
   shall be no ox in the stalls:

   18 But I--in Jehovah will I exult, I will rejoice in the God of my
   salvation:

   19 Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength; And he will set my feet as those
   of hinds, And on my high places will he make me to walk--To the leader
   on my beatings.

   CHAPTER 1

   1 The word of Jehovah, which came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the
   son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of
   Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah.

   2 By removing I will remove all things from the face of the land, saith
   Jehovah; I will remove man and beast;

   3 And I will remove the bird of heaven, And the fishes of the sea: And
   stumblingblocks shall be to the ungodly! And I will cut off man From
   the face of the land, saith Jehovah: (190)

   4 Yea, I will extend my hand upon Judah, And upon all the inhabitants
   of Je; And will cut off from this place the remnants of Baal, The name
   of its worshippers with the priests;

   5 And those who worship, On their roofs, the host of heaven; And those
   who worship and swear by Jehovah, And swear by their own king;

   6 And who turn back from following Jehovah, And who seek not Jehovah,
   And do not inquire of him.

   7 Be silent at the presence of the Lord Jehovah! For nigh is the day of
   Jehovah; Yea, prepared hath Jehovah a sacrifice, He hath prepared his
   guests:

   8 And it shall be in the day of Jehovah's sacrifice, That I will visit
   the princes and the king's sons, And all who wear foreign apparel;

   9 And I will visit all those who dance on the threshold in that day,
   Who fill the house of their masters By means of rapine and fraud. (204)

   10 And there shall be in that day, saith Jehovah, The voice of crying
   from the fish-gate, and howling from the second gate, And great breach
   from the hills. (212)

   11 Howl ye, inhabitants of the lower part, For exterminated are the
   people of traffic, Cut off are all loaded with money.

   12 And it shall be in that day, That I will search Jerusalem with
   candles, And visit the men, congealed on their lees, Who say in their
   hearts,--"Good will not Jehovah do, Nor will he do evil:"

   13 And their substance shall be a spoil, And their house a water; And
   houses shall they build and not inhabit; And plant shall they
   vineyards, And shall not drink the wine of them.

   14 Nigh is the great day of Jehovah, Nigh and hastening quickly; The
   voice of Jehovah's day will cry out bitterly,--then will he be strong;
   (222)

   15 A day of wrath shall be that day, A day of distress and of
   affliction, A day of tumult and of desolation, A day of darkness and of
   thick darkness, A day of clouds and of mist;

   16 A day of trumpet and of shouting over the fortified cities and over
   the lofty citadels.

   17 And I will straiten men, And they shall walk as the blind, Because
   they have done wickedly against Jehovah; And poured out shall be their
   blood as dust,

   18 Even their silver and their gold shall not avail to deliver them, in
   the day of Jehovah's wrath; And by the fire of his indignation shall
   their land be consumed; For a consummation, and a speedy one, Will be
   made of all the inhabitants of the land.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 Gather yourselves, gather, Ye nation, not worthy of being loved;

   2 Before the decree brings forth,--(As chaff shall they pass away in a
   day) Before it comes upon you, The fury of Jehovah's anger,--Before it
   comes upon you, The day of the anger of Jehovah. (232)

   3 Seek Jehovah all ye meek of the land, who his judgment have sought;
   Seek righteousness, seek humility, It may be that ye shall be concealed
   In the day of Jehovah's anger.

   4 For Gaza, it shall be forsaken, And Ashkelon shall be a waste; Ashod
   shall they at mid-day drive out, And Ekron shall be rooted up.

   5 Ho! the inhabitants of the line of the sea, The nation of the
   Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you; Cannaan! the land of
   the Philistines! I will also exterminate thee, That there may be no
   inhabitant:

   6 And the coast of the sea shall be a habitation For sheepcots of
   shepherds and folds for sheep; (242)

   7 And that coast shall be for the residence of the house of Judah;
   Among them shall they feed; In the houses of Ashkelon shall they in the
   evening lie down; For visit them shall Jehovah their God, and he will
   restore their captivity.

   8 Heard have I the reproach of Moab, And the revilings of the children
   of Ammon; By which they have upbraided my people; And they have
   extended themselves over their border: (247)

   9 Therefore as I live, Saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of
   Israel,--Surely Moab like Sodom shall be, And the children of Ammon
   like Gomorrah, A soil for the nettle and a mine for salt, And a waste
   for ever; The residue of my people shall plunder them, And the remnant
   of my nation shall possess them.

   10 This shall be to them for their pride; Because they have reproached,
   And exulted over the people of Jehovah of hosts.

   11 Terrible will Jehovah be to them; For he will consume all the gods
   of the earth, And worship him shall each from his place, All the
   islands of the nations.--

   12 Ye also Ethiopians!--Slain by my sword shall they be.

   13 And extend will he his hand to the north, And he will destroy
   Assyria, And set Nineveh a waste, A desolation like the desert:

   14 And lie down within it shall flocks, All the beasts of the nations;
   Even the bittern and the owl Shall on its pillars pass the night; A
   voice shall sing in the window, In the door-way there shall be
   desolation, For he will make bare the cedar.

   15 This is the exulting city! Which sat in confidence, Which said in
   her heart,--"I am, and there is besides me no other." How is she become
   a waste, A resting-place for beasts! Every one who shall pass by will
   hiss at her, he will shake his hand.

   CHAPTER 3

   1 Woe to the polluted and the filthy--The city which is an oppressor!
   (261)

   2 She has not attended to the voice, She has not received correction,
   In Jehovah has she not trusted, To her God she has not drawn nigh!

   3 Her princes within her are roaring lions, Her judges, the wolves of
   the evening; They break not the bones in the morning!

   4 Her Prophets are vain, men of deceits; (268) Her Priests have
   polluted what is holy, They have subverted the law. (269)

   5 Jehovah is just in the midst of her, He will not do iniquity; Every
   morning his judgment He brings to light,--he fails not: Yet the unjust
   knoweth no shame.

   6 I have cut off nations, Waste have become their citadels, I have
   destroyed their streets, So that no one passes through; Wasted have
   become their cities, That there is not a man, not an inhabitant: (275)

   7 I said, "surely, thou wilt fear me, Thou wilt receive instruction;"
   Then cut off should not be her habitation, However I might have visited
   her:--(279) Truly! they have hastened, They have corrupted all their
   doings!

   8 Therefore look for me, saith Jehovah, Till the day when I shall rise
   up for the prey; For my purpose is, To gather nations, to assemble
   kingdoms, That I may pour upon them my wrath, The whole fury of mine
   anger; For with the fire of my indignation Shall be devoured the whole
   earth. (281)

   9 But I will then turn to the people a pure lip, That they may all call
   on the name of Jehovah, That they may serve him with one consent. (283)

   10 Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia shall be my suppliants; The daughter
   of my dispersed shall bring mine offering.

   11 In that day thou shalt not be ashamed on account of all thy doings,
   By which thou hast transgressed against me; For then will I remove from
   the midst of thee those who rejoice in thy pride, And thou shalt not
   take pride any more In my holy mountain. (292)

   12 And I will cause to remain in the midst of thee, A people afflicted
   and poor; And they shall trust in the name of Jehovah.

   13 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, And they shall not
   speak falsehood, And not found in their mouth shall be a deceitful
   tongue; And they shall feed and lie down, And there shall be none to
   terrify them

   14 Exult thou daughter of Sion, Exult thou Israel; Rejoice, exult with
   thy whole heart, Thou daughter of je: (299)

   15 Removed has Jehovah thy judgments, He has turned aside thine
   enemies; The King of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of thee, Thou
   shalt see evil no more.

   16 in that day it shall be said to je, Fear not; Sion! relaxed let not
   thine hands be.

   17 Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, He is strong, he will save;
   He will exult over thee with joy, He will rest in his love, (304) He
   will exult over thee with triumph.

   18 The afflicted, at the appointed time, Will I gather,--who shall be
   of thee; Who sustained for her reproach. (308)

   19 Behold, I will destroy all thine oppressors at that time, And I will
   save the halting, And restore the driven away, To make them a praise
   and a name In the land of their reproach.

   20 At that time will I restore you, At that time will I gather you; For
   I will make you a name and a praise among all the nations of the earth;
   When I shall restore your captivities, Before your eyes saith Jehovah.

   A TRANSLATION of

   CALVIN'S VERSION of

   THE BOOK OF HAGGAI
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the
   first day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the Prophet,
   to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to
   Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying--

   2 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, saying--This people say, "The time is
   not come to build the house of Jehovah."

   3 Then came the word of Jehovah, By Haggai, the Prophet, saying--

   4 "Is it time for you to dwell yourselves in your boarded houses, And
   this house a waste!"

   5 And now thus saith Jehovah of hosts,--Apply your heart to your ways:

   6 Ye have sown much, and brought in little; Ye have eaten, and were not
   satisfied; Ye have drank, and were not replenished; Ye have clothed
   yourselves, and were not warmed; And he who gains wages, Gains wages
   for a perforated bag. (330)

   7 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts,--Apply your heart to your ways;

   8 Ascend unto the mountain and bring wood, And build the house; And I
   will be to you propitious in it, And glorified shall I be, saith
   Jehovah. (333)

   9 Ye have looked for much, but behold little! And ye brought it home,
   and I blew on it: Why is this? saith Jehovah; On account of my house,
   because it is waste, And ye run, each of you to his own house.

   10 Therefore restrained over you Are the heavens from dew; And the
   earth from producing is restrained:

   11 Yea, I have called for drought on the land and on the mountains, And
   on the corn and the wine and the oil, And on everything which the earth
   produces, on man and on beast, and on every labour of the hands. (338)

   12 And Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to
   Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high priest, and all the residue of
   the people, attended to the voice of Jehovah, their God, and to the
   words of Haggai, the Prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him; and
   the people feared Jehovah.

   13 Then said Haggai, the messenger of Jehovah, according to Jehovah's
   message, saying to the people, "With you am I," saith Jehovah.

   14 And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of
   Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Josedech,
   the high priest, and the spirit of all the people; and the came and
   carried on the work in the Temple of Jehovah of hosts, their God,

   15 on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of
   Darius the king. [155]

   says. He refers not, as I inadvertently apprehended, to the present

   chapter.--Ed.

   CHAPTER 2.

   1 In the seventh month, and on the twenty-first day, came the word of
   Jehovah to Haggai, the Prophet, saying,--

   2 Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah,
   and to Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to all the
   residue of the people, saying,--

   3 Who among you is alive, Who saw this house in its former glory, And
   how do ye see it now? Is it not to that as nothing in your eyes?

   4 Yet now strong be thou Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; And strong be all
   the people of the land; And work, for with you am I, Saith Jehovah of
   hosts,

   5 According to the word I covenanted with you, When ye came forth from
   Egypt, And my Spirit shall be in the midst of you, fear ye not. (354)

   6 For thus saith Jehovah of hosts,--Yet for a little while shall be
   this,

   7 And I will shake the heavens and the earth, Also the sea and the dry
   land: Yea, I will shake all nations, And come shall the choice things
   of all nations; And I will fill this house with glory, Saith Jehovah of
   hosts:

   8 Mine the silver and mine the gold, Saith Jehovah of hosts:

   9 Greater shall be the glory of this latter house than that of the
   former, Saith Jehovah of hosts; And in this place will I give peace,
   Saith Jehovah of hosts.

   10 on the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, in the second year of
   Darius, came the word of Jehovah to Haggai, the Prophet, saying,--

   11 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Ask the priests respecting the law,
   saying,--

   12 If a man carry holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his
   skirt touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any eatable, shall
   it be made holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

   13 Then said Haggai, If any one polluted in his person touch any of
   these things, shall it be polluted? The priests answered and said, It
   shall be polluted.

   14 Then answered Haggai, and said,--So is this people, and so is this
   nation, In my sight, saith Jehovah; And so is every work of their
   hands, And what they offer,--it is polluted.

   15 And now I pray, lay it to heart,--From this day and beyond it,
   Before a stone was laid on a stone In the temple of Jehovah,--

   16 Before this time, when one came to a heap of twenty, there were but
   ten measures, When he came to the vat to draw fifty, There were from
   the vat but twenty vessels:

   17 I smote you with blasting and mildew and hail, As to every work of
   your hands; And ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah.

   18 Lay it, I pray, to your heart,--From this day and beyond it, From
   the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, From the day the temple of
   Jehovah was founded;--Lay it to your heart,--

   19 Is there now seed in the barn? And as yet the vine and the fig tree,
   And the pomegranate and the olive, Have produced nothing;--From this
   day will I bless you. (378)

   20 And the word of Jehovah came again to Haggai, on the twenty-fourth
   of the month, saying,--

   21 Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, saying,--

   22 I will shake the heavens and the earth, And will overthrow the
   throne of kingdoms, And destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the
   nations; Yea, I will overthrow chariots and their riders, And down
   shall come the horses and their riders, Every one by the sword of his
   brother:

   23 In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will take Zerubbabel, The son
   of Shealtiel, my servant, saith Jehovah, And I will make thee as a
   signet, For I have chosen thee, saith Jehovah of hosts.
