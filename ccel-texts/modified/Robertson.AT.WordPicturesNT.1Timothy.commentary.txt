  1 Timothy

A.T. Robertson
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 1

   1:1 According to the commandment [kat' epitagen]. A late Koine word
   (Polybius, Diodorus), but a Pauline word also in N.T. This very idiom
   ("by way of command") in 1Co 7:6; 2Co 8:8; Ro 16:26; 1Ti 1:1; Tit 1:3.
   Paul means to say that he is an apostle under orders. Of God our
   Saviour [theou sOteros hemOn]. Genitive case with [epitagen]. In the
   LXX [sOter] (old word from [sOzO] for agent in saving, applied to
   deities, princes, kings, etc.) occurs 20 times, all but two to God. The
   Romans called the emperor "Saviour God." In the N.T. the designation of
   God as Saviour is peculiar to Lu 1:47; Jude 1:25; 1Ti 1:3; 2:3; 4:10;
   Tit 1:3; 2:10; 3:4. In the other Epistles Paul uses it of Christ (Php
   3:20; Eph 5:23) as in 2Ti 1:10. In 2Pe 1:1 we have "our God and Saviour
   Jesus Christ" as in Tit 2:13. Our hope [tes elpidos hemOn]. Like Col
   1:27. More than the author and object of hope, "its very substance and
   foundation" (Ellicott).

   1:2 True [gnesiOi]. Legitimate, not spurious. Old word from [ginomai],
   but Pauline only in N.T. (Php 4:3; 2Co 8:8; Tit 1:4). In Php 2:20 the
   adverb [gnesiOs] occurs and of Timothy again. Christ Jesus [Christou
   Iesou]. So twice already in verse 1 and as usual in the later Epistles
   (Col 1:1; Eph 1:1).

   1:3 As I exhorted [kathOs parekalesa]. There is an ellipse of the
   principal clause in verse 4 (so do I now not being in the Greek). To
   tarry [prosmeinai]. First aorist active infinitive of [prosmenO], old
   verb, attributed by Luke to Paul in Ac 13:43. That thou mightest charge
   [hina paraggeileis]. Subfinal clause with [hina] and the first aorist
   active subjunctive of [paraggellO], old verb, to transmit a message
   along [para] from one to another. See 2Th 3:4, 6, 10. Lock considers
   this idiom here an elliptical imperative like Eph 4:29; 5:33. Certain
   men [tisin]. Dative case. Expressly vague (no names as in 1:20), though
   Paul doubtless has certain persons in Ephesus in mind. Not to teach a
   different doctrine [me heterodidaskalein]. Earliest known use of this
   compound like [kakodidaskalein] of Clement of Rome. Only other N.T.
   example in 6:3. Eusebius has [heterodidaskalos]. Same idea in Ga 1:6;
   2Co 11:4; Ro 16:17. Perhaps coined by Paul.

   1:4 To give heed [prosechein]. With [noun] understood. Old and common
   idiom in N.T. especially in Luke and Acts (Ac 8:10ff.). Not in Paul's
   earlier Epistles. 1Ti 3:8; 4:1, 13; Tit 1:14. To fables [muthois].
   Dative case of old word for speech, narrative, story, fiction,
   falsehood. In N.T. only 2Pe 1:16; 1Ti 1:4; 4:7; Tit 1:14; 2Ti 4:4.
   Genealogies [genealogiais]. Dative of old word, in LXX, in N.T. only
   here and Tit 3:9. Endless [aperantois]. Old verbal compound (from [a]
   privative and [perainO], to go through), in LXX, only here in N.T.
   Excellent examples there for old words used only in the Pastorals
   because of the subject matter, describing the Gnostic emphasis on
   aeons. Questionings [ekzeteseis]. "Seekings out." Late and rare
   compound from [ekzeteO] (itself Koine word, Ro 3:11 from LXX and in
   papyri). Here only in N.T. Simplex [zetesis] in Ac 15:2; 1Ti 6:4; Tit
   3:9; 2Ti 2:23. A dispensation [oikonomian]. Pauline word (1Co 9:17; Col
   1:25; Eph 1:9; 3:9; 1Ti 1:4), Lu 16:2-4 only other N.T. examples. In
   faith [en pistei]. Pauline use of [pistis].

   1:5 The end [to telos]. See Ro 6:21; 10:4 for [telos] (the good aimed
   at, reached, result, end). Love [agape]. Not "questionings." Ro 13:9.
   "Three conditions for the growth of love" (Parry): "Out of a pure
   heart" [ek katharas kardias], O.T. conception), "and a good conscience"
   [kai suneideseOs agathes], for which see Ro 2:25), "and faith
   unfeigned" [kai pisteOs anupokritou], late compound verbal in 2Co 6:6;
   Ro 12:9).

   1:6 Having swerved [astochesantes]. First aorist active participle of
   [astocheO], compound Koine verb (Polybius, Plutarch) from [astochos]
   [a] privative and [stochos], a mark), "having missed the mark." In N.T.
   only here, 6:21; 2Ti 2:18. With the ablative case [hOn] (which). Have
   turned aside [exetrapesan]. Second aorist passive indicative of
   [ektrepO], old and common verb, to turn or twist out or aside. In
   medical sense in Heb 12:13. As metaphor in 1Ti 1:6; 6:20; 2Ti 4:4. Vain
   talking [mataiologian]. Late word from [mataiologos], only here in
   N.T., in the literary Koine.

   1:7 Teachers of the law [nomodidaskaloi]. Compound only in N.T. (here,
   Lu 5:17; Ac 5:34) and ecclesiastical writers. Though they understand
   [noountes]. Concessive participle of [noeO], old verb (Eph 3:4,20).
   Neither what [mete ha]. Relative [ha] (which things). Nor whereof [mete
   peri tinOn]. Here the interrogative [tinOn] used in sense of relative
   [hOn]. It may be regarded as the use of an indirect question for
   variety (Parry). They confidently affirm [diabebaiountai]. Present
   middle indicative of the common Koine compound, in N.T. only here and
   Tit 3:8.

   1:8 If a man use it lawfully [ean tis autOi chretai]. Condition of
   third class with [ean] and present middle subjunctive of [chraomai]
   with instrumental case.

   1:9 Is not made for [ou keitai]. The use of [keitai] for [tetheitai]
   (perfect passive of [tithemi] is a common enough idiom. See the same
   point about law in Ga 18-23; Ro 13:13. For "knowing this" [eidOs touto]
   see Eph 5:5. Unruly [anupotaktois]. Dative (like all these words) of
   the late verbal [a] privative and [hupotassO]. In N.T. only here, Tit
   1:6,10; Heb 2:8. Ungodly [asebesi]. See Ro 4:5; 5:6. Sinners
   [hamartOlois]. See Ro 3:7. Unholy [anosiois]. Common word [a] privative
   and [hosios]. In N.T. only here and 2Ti 3:2). Profane [bebelois]. Old
   word from [bainO], to go, and [belos], threshold. See Heb 12:16.
   Murderers of fathers [patrolOiais]. Late form for common Attic
   [patralOiais] (from [pater], father, and [aloiaO], to smite) only here
   in N.T. Murderers of mothers [metrolOiais]. Late form Attic
   [metralOiais]. Only here in N.T. Manslayers [andraphonois]. Old
   compound [aner], man, [phonos], murder). Only here in N.T.

   1:10 For abusers of themselves with men [arsenokoitais]. Late compound
   for sodomites. In N.T. only here and 1Co 6:9. Men-stealers
   [andrapodistais]. Old word from [andrapodizO] (from [aner], man,
   [pous], foot, to catch by the foot), to enslave. So enslavers, whether
   kidnappers (men-stealers) of free men or stealers of the slaves of
   other men. So slave-dealers. By the use of this word Paul deals a blow
   at the slave-trade (cf. Philemon). Liars [pseustais]. Old word, see Ro
   3:4. False swearers [epiorkois]. Old word [epi, orkos], oath).
   Perjurers. Only here in N.T. For similar lists, see 1Co 5:11; 6:9f.; Ga
   5:19f.; Ro 1:28f.; 13:13; Col 3:5; Eph 5:5; 2Ti 3:2f. The sound
   doctrine [tei hugiainousei didaskaliai]. Dative case after
   [antikeitai], for which verb see Ga 5:17 for the conflict between the
   Spirit and the flesh. "The healthful [hugiainO], old word for being
   well, as Lu 5:31; 3Jo 1:2, in figurative sense in N.T. only in the
   Pastorals) teaching." See Tit 1:9; 2Ti 4:3.

   1:11 Of the blessed God [tou makariou theou]. Applied to God only here
   and 6:15, but in Tit 2:13 [makarios] occurs with [elpis] (hope) of the
   "epiphany of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ." Which was
   committed to my trust [ho episteuthen egO]. "with which [ho] accusative
   retained with first aorist passive verb [episteuthen] I was entrusted."

   1:12 I thank [charin echO]. "I have gratitude to." Common phrase (Lu
   17:9), not elsewhere in Paul. That enabled me [tOi endunamOsanti me].
   First aorist active articular participle of [endunamoO]. Late verb, but
   regular Pauline idiom (Ro 4:20; Php 4:13; Eph 6:10; 1Ti 1:12; 2Ti
   4:17). Appointing me to his service [themenos eis diakonian]. Second
   aorist middle participle. Pauline phrase and atmosphere (Ac 20:24; 1Co
   3:5; 12:18, 28; 2Co 3:6; 4:1; Col 1:23; Eph. 3:7; 1Ti 4:6; 2Ti 4:5,
   11).

   1:13 Before [to proteron]. Accusative of general reference of the
   articular comparative, "as to the former-time," formerly, as in Ga
   4:13. Though I was [onta]. Concessive participle agreeing with [me].
   Blasphemer [blasphemon]. Old word either from [blax] (stupid) and
   [pheme], speech, or from [blaptO], to injure. Rare in N.T. but Paul
   uses [blasphemeO], to blaspheme in Ro 2:24. Persecutor [diOktes]. So
   far found only here. Probably made by Paul from [diOkO], which he knew
   well enough (Ac 22:4, 7; 26:14f.; Ga 1:13, 23; Php 3:6; 2Ti 3:12).
   Injurious [hubristen]. Substantive, not adjective, "an insolent man."
   Old word from [hubrizO], in N.T. only here and Ro 1:30. I obtained
   mercy [eleethen]. First aorist passive indicative of [eleeO], old verb.
   See 2Co 4:1; Ro 11:30f. Ignorantly [agnoOn]. Present active participle
   of [agnoeO], "not knowing." Old verb (Ro 2:4). In a blindness of heart.
   In unbelief [en apistiai]. See Ro 11:20,25.

   1:14 Abounded exceedingly [huperepleonasen]. Aorist active indicative
   of the late and rare (So 5:19 and in Herond.) compound [huperpleonazO]
   (here alone in N.T.), in later ecclesiastical writers. The simplex
   [pleonazO] Paul used in Ro 5:20; 6:1 and the kindred
   [hupereperisseusen] used also with [he charis]. Paul is fond of
   compounds with [huper]. For "faith in Christ Jesus" see Ga 3:26, for
   "faith and love in Christ Jesus" as here, see 2Ti 1:13.

   1:15 Faithful is the saying [pistos ho logos]. Five times in the
   Pastorals (1Ti 1:15; 3:1; 4:9; Tit 3:8; 2Ti 2:11). It will pay to note
   carefully [pistis, pisteuO, pistos]. Same use of [pistos] (trustworthy)
   applied to [logos] in Tit 1:9; Re 21:5; 22:6. Here and probably in 2Ti
   2:11 a definite saying seems to be referred to, possibly a quotation
   [hoti] of a current saying quite like the Johannine type of teaching.
   This very phrase (Christ coming into the world) occurs in Joh 9:37;
   11:27; 16:28; 18:37. Paul, of course, had no access to the Johannine
   writings, but such "sayings" were current among the disciples. There is
   no formal quotation, but "the whole phrase implies a knowledge of
   Synoptic and Johannine language" (Lock) as in Lu 5:32; Joh 12:47.
   Acceptation [apodoches]. Genitive case with [axios] (worthy of). Late
   word (Polybius, Diod., Jos.) in N.T. only here and 4:9. Chief [prOtos].
   Not [en] (I was), but [eimi] (I am). "It is not easy to think of any
   one but St. Paul as penning these words" (White). In 1Co 15:9 he had
   called himself "the least of the apostles" [elachistos tOn apostolOn].
   In Eph 3:8 he refers to himself as "the less than the least of all
   saints" [tOi elachistoterOi pantOn hagiOn]. On occasion Paul would
   defend himself as on a par with the twelve apostles (Ga 2:6-10) and
   superior to the Judaizers (2Co 11:5f.; 12:11). It is not mock humility
   here, but sincere appreciation of the sins of his life (cf. Ro 7:24) as
   a persecutor of the church of God (Ga 1:13), of men and even women (Ac
   22:4f.; 26:11). He had sad memories of those days.

   1:16 In me as chief [en emoi prOtOi]. Probably starts with the same
   sense of [prOtos] as in verse 15 (rank), but turns to order (first in
   line). Paul becomes the "specimen" sinner as an encouragement to all
   who come after him. Might shew forth [endeixetai]. First aorist middle
   subjunctive (purpose with [hina] of [endeiknumi], to point out, for
   which see Eph 2:7 (same form with [hina]. Longsuffering [makrothumian].
   Common Pauline word (2Co 6:6). For an ensample [pros hupotupOsin]. Late
   and rare word (in Galen, Sext. Emp., Diog. Laert., here only in N.T.)
   from late verb [hupotupoO] (in papyri) to outline. So substantive here
   is a sketch, rough outline. Paul is a sample of the kind of sinners
   that Jesus came to save. See [hupodeigma] in 2Pe 2:6.

   1:17 This noble doxology is a burst of gratitude for God's grace to
   Paul. For other doxologies see Ga 1:5; Ro 11:36; 16:27; Php 4:20; Eph
   3:21; 1Ti 6:16. White suggests that Paul may have often used this
   doxology in his prayers. Lock suggests "a Jewish liturgical formula" (a
   needless suggestion in view of Paul's wealth of doxologies seen above).
   For God's creative activity (King of the ages) see 1Co 10:11; Eph 2:7;
   3:9, 11. Incorruptible [aphthartOi]. As an epithet of God also in Ro
   1:23. Invisible [aoratOi]. Epithet of God in Col 1:15. The only God
   [monOi theOi]. So Ro 16:27; Joh 5:44; 17:3. For ever and ever [eis tous
   aiOnas tOn aiOnOn]. "Unto the ages of ages." Cf. Eph 3:21 "of the age
   of the ages."

   1:18 I commit [paratithemai]. Present middle indicative of old and
   common verb, to place beside [para] as food on table, in the middle to
   entrust (Lu 12:48) and used by Jesus as he was dying (Lu 23:46). Here
   it is a banking figure and repeated in 2Ti 2:2. According to the
   prophecies which went before on thee [kata tas proagousas epi se
   propheteias]. Intransitive use of [proagO], to go before. When Timothy
   first comes before us (Ac 16:2) "he was testified to" [emartureito] by
   the brethren. He began his ministry rich in hopes, prayers,
   predictions. That by them thou mayest war the good warfare [hina
   strateuei en autais ten kalen strateian]. Cognate accusative
   [strateian], old word from [strateuO], in N.T. only here and 2Co 4:4)
   with [strateuei] (second person singular middle present subjunctive of
   [strateuO], old verb chiefly in Paul in N.T., 1Co 9:7; 2Co 10:3). As if
   in defensive armour.

   1:19 Holding faith and a good conscience [echOn pistin kai agathen
   suneidesin]. Possibly as a shield (Eph 6:16) or at any rate possessing
   (Ro 2:20) faith as trust and a good conscience. A leader expects them
   of his followers and must show them himself. Having thrust from them
   [apOsamenoi]. First aorist indirect middle participle of [apOtheO], to
   push away from one. Old verb (see Ro 11:1f.). Made shipwreck
   [enauagesan]. First aorist active indicative of [nauageO], old verb
   from [nauagos] (shipwrecked, [naus], ship, [agnumi], to break), to
   break a ship to pieces. In N.T. only here and 2Co 11:25. Concerning the
   faith [peri ten pistin]. Rather, "concerning their faith" (the article
   here used as a possessive pronoun, a common Greek idiom).

   1:20 Hymenaeus [Humenaios]. The same heretic reappears in 2Ti 2:17. He
   and Alexander are the chief "wreckers" of faith in Ephesus. Alexander
   [Alexandros]. Probably the same as the one in 2Ti 4:14, but not the Jew
   of that name in Ac 19:33, unless he had become a Christian since then.
   I delivered unto Satan [paredOka tOi Satanai]. See this very idiom
   [paradounai tOi Satanai] in 1Co 5:5. It is a severe discipline of
   apostolic authority, apparently exclusion and more than mere
   abandonment (1Th 2:18; 1Co 5:11; 2Co 2:11), though it is an obscure
   matter. That they might be taught not to blaspheme [hina paideuthOsin
   me blasphemein]. Purpose clause with [hina] and first aorist passive
   subjunctive of [paideuO]. For this use of this common late verb, see
   1Co 11:32; 2Co 6:9.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2

   2:1 First of all [prOton pantOn]. Take with [parakalO]. My first
   request (first in importance). Intercessions [enteuxeis]. Late word
   (Polybius, Plutarch, etc.), only here in N.T. and 4:5, though the verb
   [entugchanO] in Ro 8:27, 34; 11:2,25. The other three words for prayer
   are common (Php 4:6). For all men [huper pantOn anthrOpOn]. The scope
   of prayer is universal including all kinds of sinners (and saints).

   2:2 For kings [huper basileOn]. And this included Nero who had already
   set fire to Rome and laid it on the Christians whom he was also
   persecuting. And all them that are in high place [kai pantOn tOn en
   huperochei ontOn]. [Huperoche] is old word (from [huperochos] and this
   from [huper] and [echO], but in N.T. only here and 1Co 2:1. That we may
   lead [hina diagOmen]. Purpose clause with present active subjunctive of
   [diagO], an old and common verb, but in N.T. only here and Tit 3:3.
   Tranquil [eremon]. Late adjective from the old adverb [erema] (stilly,
   quietly). Here only in N.T. Quiet [hesuchion]. Old adjective, once in
   LXX (Isa 66:2), in N.T. only here and 1Pe 3:4. Life [bion]. Old word
   for course of life (not [zOe]. So Lu 8:14. Gravity [semnoteti]. Old
   word from [semnos] (Php 4:8), in N.T. only here, 3:4; Tit 2:7.

   2:3 Acceptable [apodekton]. Late verbal adjective from [apodechomai].
   In inscriptions and papyri. In N.T. only here and 5:4.

   2:4 Willeth [thelei]. God's wish and will in so far as he can influence
   men. That all men should be saved [pantas anthrOpous sOthenai]. First
   aorist passive infinitive of [sOzO] with accusative of general
   reference. See 1Co 10:33; 2Co 5:18f. To the knowledge [eis epignOsin].
   "The full knowledge" as in Col 1:6; Eph 4:13 (ten times in Paul). See
   2Ti 3:7 for the whole phrase "full knowledge of the truth" [aletheia]
   14 times in the Pastorals). Paul is anxious as in Colossians and
   Ephesians that the Gnostics may not lead the people astray. They need
   the full intellectual apprehension of Christianity.

   2:5 One God [heis theos]. Regular Pauline argument for a universal
   gospel (Ga 3:20; Ro 3:30; Eph 4:6). One mediator [heis mesites]. Late
   word (Polybius, Philo) from [mesos] (middle), a middle man. In N.T.
   only here, Ga 3:20; Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24. Between God and men [theou
   kai anthrOpOn]. Ablative case (though objective genitive may explain
   it) after [mesites] (notion of separation) as in Ro 10:12; Heb 5:14.
   Himself man [anthrOpos]. No "himself" [autos] in the Greek.

   2:6 A ransom for all [antilutron huper pantOn]. "A reminiscence of the
   Lord's own saying" (Lock) in Mt 20:28 (Mr 10:45) where we have [lutron
   anti pollOn]. In the papyri [huper] is the ordinary preposition for the
   notion of substitution where benefit is involved as in this passage.
   [Anti] has more the idea of exchange and [antilutron huper] combines
   both ideas. [Lutron] is the common word for ransom for a slave or a
   prisoner. Paul may have coined [antilutron] with the saying of Christ
   in mind (only one MS. of Ps 48:9 and Orph. Litt. 588). See Ga 1:4 "who
   gave himself for our sins." The testimony [to marturion]. Either the
   nominative absolute or the accusative absolute in apposition to the
   preceding clause like [to adunaton] in Ro 8:3. In its own times
   [kairois idiois]. Locative case as in 6:15; Tit 1:3. See Ga 6:9 for
   "due season." There is no predicate or participle here, "the testimony
   in its due seasons" (plural).

   2:7 For which [eis ho]. The testimony of Jesus in his self-surrender
   (verse 6). See [eis ho] in 2Ti 1:11. I was appointed [etethen egO].
   First aorist passive indicative of [tithemi]. Preacher and apostle
   [kerux kai apostolos]. In 2Ti 1:10 Paul adds [didaskalos] (herald,
   apostle, teacher) as he does here with emphasis. In Col 1:23f. he has
   [diakonos] (minister). He frequently uses [kerussO] of himself (1Co
   1:23; 9:27; Ga 2:2; Ro 10:8f.). I speak the truth, I lie not [aletheian
   legO, ou pseudomai]. A Pauline touch (Ro 9:1). Cf. Ga 1:20; 2Co 11:31.
   Here alone he calls himself "a teacher of the Gentiles," elsewhere
   apostle (Ro 11:13), minister (Ro 15:16), prisoner (Eph 3:1).

   2:8 I desire [boulomai]. So Php 1:12. The men [tous andras]. Accusative
   of general reference with the infinitive [proseuchesthai]. The men in
   contrast to "women" [gunaikas] in 9. It is public worship, of course,
   and "in every place" [en panti topOi] for public worship. Many modern
   Christians feel that there were special conditions in Ephesus as in
   Corinth which called for strict regulations on the women that do not
   always apply now. Lifting up holy hands [epairontas hosious cheiras].
   Standing to pray. Note also [hosious] used as feminine (so in Plato)
   with [cheiras] instead of [hosias]. The point here is that only men
   should lead in public prayer who can lift up "clean hands" (morally and
   spiritually clean). See Lu 24:50. Adverb [hosiOs] in 1Th 2:10 and
   [hosiotes] in Eph 4:24. Without wrath and disputing [chOris orges kai
   dialogismou]. See Php 2:14.

   2:9 In like manner that women [hosautOs gunaikas]. [Boulomai] must be
   repeated from verse 8, involved in [hosautOs] (old adverb, as in Ro
   8:26). Parry insists that [proseuchomenas] (when they pray) must be
   supplied also. Grammatically that is possible (Lock), but it is hardly
   consonant with verses 11-15 (White). Adorn themselves [kosmein
   heautas]. Present active infinitive after [boulomai] understood. Old
   word from [kosmos] (arrangement, ornament, order, world). See Lu 21:5;
   Tit 2:10. See Co 11:5ff. for Paul's discussion of women's dress in
   public worship. In modest apparel [en katastolei kosmiOi]. [Katastole]
   is a late word (a letting down, [katastellO], of demeanour or dress,
   arrangement of dress). Only here in N.T. [Kosmios] is old adjective
   from [kosmos] and means well-arranged, becoming. W. H. have adverb in
   margin [kosmiOs]. With shamefastness [meta aidous]. Old word for shame,
   reverence, in N.T. only here and Heb 12:28. Sobriety [sOphrosunes]. Old
   word, in N.T. only here, verse 15, and Ac 26:15 (Paul also). Not with
   braided hair [me en plegmasin]. Old word from [plekO], to plait, to
   braid, for nets, baskets, here only in N.T. Cf. 1Pe 3:1 [emplokes]. And
   gold [en chrusiOi]. Locative case with [en] repeated. Some MSS. read
   [chrusOi]. Both used for gold ornaments. Or pearls [e margaritais]. See
   Mt 7:6 for this word. Or costly raiment [e himatismOi polutelei].
   [Himatismos] a common Koine word from [himatizO], to clothe.
   [Poluteles], old word from [polus] and [telos] (great price). See Mr
   14:3.

   2:10 Becometh [prepei]. Old word for seemly. Paul wishes women to wear
   "becoming" clothes, but [theosebeian] (godliness, from [theosebes], Joh
   9:31, [theos, sebomai], worship) is part of the "style" desired. Only
   here in N.T. Good dress and good works combined.

   2:11 In quietness [en hesuchiai]. Old word from [hesuchios]. In N.T.
   only here, Ac 22:2; 2Th 3:12. In all subjection [en pasei hupotagei].
   Late word (Dion. Hal., papyri), in N.T. only here, 2Co 9:13; Ga 2:5.
   See 1Co 14:33-35.

   2:12 I permit not [ouk epitrepO]. Old word [epitrepO], to permit, to
   allow (1Co 16:7). Paul speaks authoritatively. To teach [didaskein]. In
   the public meeting clearly. And yet all modern Christians allow women
   to teach Sunday school classes. One feels somehow that something is not
   expressed here to make it all clear. Nor to have dominion over a man
   [oude authentein andros]. The word [authenteO] is now cleared up by
   Kretschmer (Glotta, 1912, pp. 289ff.) and by Moulton and Milligan's
   Vocabulary. See also Nageli, Der Wortschatz des Apostels Paulus and
   Deissmann, Light, etc., pp. 88f. [AutodikeO] was the literary word for
   playing the master while [authenteO] was the vernacular term. It comes
   from [aut-hentes], a self-doer, a master, autocrat. It occurs in the
   papyri (substantive [authentes], master, verb [authenteO], to domineer,
   adjective [authentikos], authoritative, "authentic"). Modern Greek has
   [aphentes] = Effendi = "Mr."

   2:13 Was first formed [prOtos eplasthe]. Note [prOtos], not [prOton],
   first before Eve. First aorist passive indicative of [plassO], old
   verb, in N.T. only here and Ro 9:20 (cf. Ge 2:7f.).

   2:14 Being beguiled [exapatetheisa]. First aorist passive participle of
   [exapateO], old compound verb, in N.T. only by Paul (2Th 2:3; 1Co 3:18;
   2Co 11:3; Ro 7:11; 16:18; 1Ti 2:14). Not certain that [ex-] here means
   "completely deceived" in contrast to simplex [ouk epatethe] used of
   Adam, though possible. Hath fallen [gegonen]. Second perfect indicative
   active, permanent state. See 1Co 11:7.

   2:15 Through the child-bearing [dia tes teknogonias]. Late and rare
   word (in Aristotle). Here alone in N.T. From [teknogonos] and this from
   [teknon] and root [genO]. This translation makes it refer to the birth
   of the Saviour as glorifying womanhood. That is true, but it is not
   clear that Paul does not have mostly in mind that child-bearing, not
   public teaching, is the peculiar function of woman with a glory and
   dignity all its own. "She will be saved" [sOthesetai] in this function,
   not by means of it. If they continue [ean meinOsin]. Condition of third
   class, [ean] with first aorist active subjunctive of [menO], to
   continue. Note change to plural from the singular [sOthesetai].
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3

   3:1 Faithful is the saying [pistos ho logos]. Here the phrase points to
   the preceding words (not like 1:15) and should close the preceding
   paragraph. If a man seeketh [ei tis oregetai]. Condition of first
   class, assumed as true. Present middle indicative of [oregO], old verb
   to reach out after something, governing the genitive. In N.T. only
   here, 6:10; Heb 11:16. The office of a bishop [episkopes]. Genitive
   case after [oregetai]. Late and rare word outside of LXX and N.T. (in a
   Lycaonian inscription). From [episkopeO] and means "over-seership" as
   in Ac 1:20.

   3:2 The bishop [ton episkopon]. The overseer. Old word, in LXX, and
   inscriptions and papyri. Deissmann (Bible Studies, pp. 230f.) has shown
   it is applied to communal officials in Rhodes. See Ac 20:28 for its use
   for the elders (presbyters) in verse 17. So also in Tit 1:5,7. See Php
   1:1. The word does not in the N.T. have the monarchical sense found in
   Ignatius of a bishop over elders. Without reproach [anepilempton].
   Accusative case of general reference with [dei] and [einai]. Old and
   common verbal [a] privative and [epilambanO], not to be taken hold of),
   irreproachable. In N.T. only here, 5:7; 6:14. Of one wife [mias
   gunaikos]. One at a time, clearly. Temperate [nephalion]. Old
   adjective. In N.T. only here, verse 11; Tit 2:2. But see [nephO], to be
   sober in 1Th 5:6, 8. Soberminded [sOphrona]. Another old adjective
   (from [saos] or [sOs], sound, [phren], mind) in N.T. only here, Tit
   1:8; 2:2,5. Orderly [kosmion]. See on 2:9. Seemly, decent conduct.
   Given to hospitality [philoxenon]. Old word (see [philoxenia] in Ro
   12:13), from [philos] and [xenos], in N.T. only here, Tit 1:8; 1Pe 4:9.
   Apt to teach [didaktikon]. Late form for old [didaskalikos], one
   qualified to teach. In Philo and N.T. only (1Ti 3:2; 2Ti 2:24).

   3:3 No brawler [me paroinon]. Later word for the earlier [paroinios],
   one who sits long at (beside, [para] his wine. In N.T. only here and
   Tit 1:3. No striker [me plekten]. Late word from [plessO], to strike.
   In N.T. only here and Tit 1:3. Gentle [epieike]. See on Php 4:5 for
   this interesting word. Not contentious [amachon]. Old word (from [a]
   privative and [mache], not a fighter. In N.T. only here and Tit 3:2. No
   lover of money [aphilarguron]. Late word [a] privative and compound
   [phil-arguros] in inscriptions and papyri (Nageli; also Deissmann,
   Light, etc., pp. 85f.). In N.T. only here and Heb 13:5.

   3:4 Ruling [proistamenon]. Present middle participle of [proistemi],
   old word to place before and (intransitive as here) to stand before.
   See 1Th 5:12; Ro 12:8. In subjection [en hupotagei]. See verse 11.

   3:5 If a man knoweth not [ei tis ouk oiden]. Condition of first class,
   assumed as true. How to rule [prostenai]. Second aorist active
   infinitive of same verb [proistemi] and with [oiden] means "know how to
   rule," not "know that he rules." How [pOs]. Rhetorical question
   expecting negative answer. Shall he take care of [epimelesetai]. Future
   middle of [epimeleomai], old compound [epi], direction of care towards)
   verb, in LXX, in N.T. only here and Lu 10:34f. The church of God
   [ekklesias theou]. Anarthrous as in verse 15, elsewhere with article
   (1Co 10:32; 15:9; 2Co 1:1; Ga 1:13). The local church described as
   belonging to God. No one in N.T. but Paul (Ac 20:28) so describes the
   church. This verse is a parenthesis in the characteristics of the
   bishop.

   3:6 Not a novice [me neophuton]. Our "neophyte." Vernacular word from
   Aristophanes on, in LXX, and in papyri in the original sense of
   "newly-planted" [neos, phuO]. Only here in N.T. Lest [hina me]. "That
   not." Being puffed up [tuphOtheis]. First aorist passive participle of
   [tuphoO], old word (from [tuphos], smoke, pride), to raise a smoke or
   mist (a smoke-screen of pride). In N.T. only here; 6:4; 2Ti 3:4. He
   fall into [empesei eis]. Second aorist active subjunctive with [hina
   me], negative purpose, of [empiptO], old verb, to fall into. Note both
   [en] and [eis] as in Mt 12:11; Lu 10:36. The condemnation of the devil
   [krima tou diabolou]. See Ro 3:8 for [krima]. Best to take [tou
   diabolou] as objective genitive, though subjective in verse 7, "the
   condemnation passed on or received by the devil" (not just "the
   slanderer," any slanderer).

   3:7 From them that are without [apo tOn exOthen]. "From the outside (of
   the church) ones." Paul's care for the witness of outsiders is seen in
   1Th 4:12; 1Co 10:32; Col 4:5. There are, of course, two sides to this
   matter. Reproach [oneidismon]. Late word from [oneidizO]. See Ro 15:3.
   The snare of the devil [pagida tou diabolou]. Here subjective genitive,
   snare set by the devil. [Pagis], old word from [pegnumi], to make fast.
   So a snare for birds (Lu 21:35), any sudden trap (Ro 11:9), of sin (1Ti
   6:9), of the devil (1Ti 3:7; 2Ti 2:26). Ancients used it of the snares
   of love. The devil sets special snares for preachers (conceit verse 6,
   money 6:9, women, ambition).

   3:8 Deacons [diakonous]. Accusative case of general reference like the
   preceding with [dei einai] understood. Technical sense of the word here
   as in Php 1:1 which see (two classes of church officers, bishops or
   elders, deacons). Grave [semnous]. See Php 4:8. Repeated in verse 11;
   Tit 2:2. Not double-tongued [me dilogous]. Rare word [dis, legO] saying
   same thing twice. Xenophon has [dilogeO] and [dilogia]. In Pollux, but
   LXX has [diglOssos] (double-tongued, Latin bilinguis). Only here in
   N.T. One placed between two persons and saying one thing to one,
   another to the other. Like Bunyan's Parson "Mr. Two-Tongues." Not given
   to much wine [me oinOi pollOi prosechontas]. "Not holding the mind [ton
   noun] understood as usual with [prosechO], 1Ti 1:4) on much wine"
   [oinOi], dative case). That attitude leads to over-indulgence. Not
   greedy of filthy lucre [me aischrokerdeis]. Old word from [aischros]
   (Eph 5:12) and [kerdos] (Php 1:21). "Making small gains in mean ways"
   (Parry). Not genuine in verse 3. In N.T. only here and Tit 1:7 (of
   bishops).

   3:9 The mystery of the faith [to musterion tes pisteOs]. "The inner
   secret of the faith," the revelation given in Christ. See for
   [musterion] in Paul (2Th 2:7; 1Co 2:7; Ro 16:25; Col 1:26; Eph 3:9). In
   a pure conscience [en katharai suneidesei]. See 1:19. "The casket in
   which the jewel is to be kept" (Lock).

   3:10 First be proved [dokimazesthOsan prOton]. Present passive
   imperative third plural of [dokimazO], old and common verb, to test as
   metals, etc. (1Th 2:4, and often in Paul). How the proposed deacons are
   to be "first" tested before approved Paul does not say. See Php 1:10
   for the two senses (test, approve) of the word. Let them serve as
   deacons [diakoneitOsan]. Present active imperative of [diakoneO] (same
   root as [diakonos], common verb, to minister, here "to serve as
   deacons." Cf. [diakonein] in Ac 6:2. See also verse 13. If they be
   blameless [anegkletoi ontes]. "Being blameless" (conditional
   participle, [ontes]. See 1Co 1:8; Col 1:22 for [anegkletos].

   3:11 Women [gunaikas]. Accusative with [dei einai] understood
   [hosautOs], likewise) as in verse 8. Apparently "women as deacons" (Ro
   16:1 about Phoebe) and not women in general or just "wives of deacons."
   See Pliny (Ep. X. 97) ministrae. Not slanderers [me diabolous].
   Original meaning of [diabolos] (from [diaballO], Lu 16:1), the devil
   being the chief slanderer (Eph 6:11). "She-devils" in reality (Tit
   2:3). "While men are more prone to be [dilogous], double-tongued, women
   are more prone than men to be slanderers" (White). Faithful in all
   things [pistas en pasin]. Perhaps as almoners (Ellicott) the
   deaconesses had special temptations.

   3:12 Of one wife [mias gunaikos]. At a time as in verse 2. Ruling well
   [proistamenoi kalOs]. As in 4.

   3:13 Gain to themselves [heautois peripoiountai]. Present middle
   indicative of [peripoieO], old verb, to make besides [peri], around,
   over), to lay by. Reflexive (indirect) middle with reflexive pronoun
   [heautois] repeated as often happens in the Koine. In N.T. only here,
   Lu 17:33; Ac 20:28 (Paul also, quoting Isa 43:21). A good standing
   [bathmon kalon]. Late word from [bainO], in LXX for steps at a door
   (1Sa 5:5). In plural the steps of a stair. In the inscriptions it means
   a good foothold or standing. The ecclesiastical writers (Theodoret)
   take it to be a higher grade or rank, but it is doubtful if Paul means
   that here. Much boldness [pollen parresian]. A Pauline phrase (2Co
   3:12; 7:4; Php 1:20). In the faith which is in Christ Jesus [en pistei
   tei en ChristOi Iesou]. Pauline phrase again (Ac 26:18; Ga 3:26; Col
   1:4; Eph 1:15; 2Ti 1:13; 3:15).

   3:14 Shortly [en tachei]. Old idiom (locative case of [tachos],
   quickness, speed). See Ro 16:20. A pseudonymous writer would hardly
   have put in this phrase. Paul's hopes were not to be realized, but he
   did not know that.

   3:15 But if I tarry long [ean de bradunO]. Condition of third class
   with [ean] and the present active subjunctive of [bradunO], old verb,
   to be slow (usually intransitive), from [bradus] (slow, dull, Lu
   24:25), in N.T. only here and 2Pe 3:9. That thou mayest know [hina
   eideis]. Final clause with [hina] and second perfect active subjunctive
   of [oida], to know. How men ought [pOs dei]. "How it is necessary for
   thee" (supply [se] more naturally than [tina], any one). Indirect
   question. To behave themselves [anastrephesthai]. Present middle
   (direct) infinitive of [anastrephO], old verb, to turn up and down. See
   2Co 1:12; Eph 2:3. In the house of God [en oikOi theou]. Probably here
   "household of God," that is "the family of God" rather than "the house
   (or temple) of God." Christians as yet had no separate houses of
   worship and [oikos] commonly means "household." Christians are the
   [naos] (sanctuary) of God (1Co 3:16f.; 2Co 6:16), and Paul calls them
   [oikeioi tou theou] (Eph 2:19) "members of God's family." It is conduct
   as members of God's family [oikos] that Paul has in mind. Which
   [hetis]. "Which very house of God," agreeing (feminine) with the
   predicate word [ekklesia] (church). The church of the living God
   [ekklesia theou zOntos]. Probably here the general church or kingdom as
   in Colossians and Ephesians, though the local church in verse 5. The
   pillar and ground of the truth [stulos kai hedraiOma tes aletheias].
   Paul changes the metaphor again as he often does. Those words are in
   apposition to [ekklesia] and [oikos]. On [stulos], old word for pillar,
   see Ga 2:9; Re 3:12 (only other N.T. examples). [HedraiOma], late and
   rare word (from [hedraioO], to make stable) occurs here first and only
   in ecclesiastical writers later. Probably it means stay or support
   rather than foundation or ground. See Co 1:23; 2Ti 2:19 for similar
   idea. See also Mt 16:18f.

   3:16 Without controversy [homologoumenOs]. Old adverb from the
   participle [homologoumenos] from [homologeO]. Here only in N.T.
   "Confessedly." Great [mega]. See Eph 5:32. "A great mystery." The
   mystery of godliness [to tes eusebeias musterion]. See verse 9 "the
   mystery of the faith," and 2:2 for [eusebeia]. Here the phrase explains
   "a pillar and stay of the truth" (verse 15). See in particular Co 1:27.
   "The revealed secret of true religion, the mystery of Christianity, the
   Person of Christ" (Lock). He who [hos]. The correct text, not [theos]
   (God) the reading of the Textus Receptus (Syrian text) nor [ho] (neuter
   relative, agreeing with [musterion] the reading of the Western
   documents. Westcott and Hort print this relative clause as a fragment
   of a Christian hymn (like Eph 5:14) in six strophes. That is probably
   correct. At any rate [hos] (who) is correct and there is asyndeton (no
   connective) in the verbs. Christ, to whom [hos] refers, is the mystery
   (Col 1:27; 2:2). Was manifested [ephanerOthe]. First aorist passive
   indicative of [phaneroO], to manifest. Here used to describe the
   incarnation [en sarki] of Christ (an answer also to the Docetic
   Gnostics). The verb is used by Paul elsewhere of the incarnation (Ro
   16:26; Col 1:26) as well as of the second coming (Col 3:4). Justified
   in the spirit [edikaiOthe en pneumati]. First aorist passive indicative
   of [dikaioO], to declare righteous, to vindicate. Christ was vindicated
   in his own spirit (Heb 9:14) before men by overcoming death and rising
   from the dead (Ro 1:3f.). Seen of angels [Ophthe aggelois]. First
   aorist passive indicative of [horaO], to see, with either the
   instrumental or the dative case of angels [aggelois]. The words were
   probably suggested by the appearance of Jesus [Ophthe], the usual form
   for the resurrection appearances of Christ) of the angels at the tomb
   and at the ascension of Christ. See Php 2:10; 1Pe 3:22 for the
   appearance of Jesus to the angels in heaven at the ascension. Some
   would take "angels" here to be "messengers" (the women). Preached among
   the nations [ekeruchthe en ethnesin]. First aorist passive indicative
   of [kerussO], to proclaim. The word [ethnos] may mean "all creation"
   (Col 1:23) and not just Gentiles as distinct from Jews. Paul had done
   more of this heralding of Christ among the Gentiles than any one else.
   It was his glory (Eph 3:1,8). Cf. 2:7. Believed on in the world
   [episteuthe en kosmOi]. First aorist indicative passive again of
   [pisteuO], to believe (2Th 1:10). Cf. 1:15; 2Co 5:19. Received up in
   glory [anelemphthe en doxei]. First aorist passive again (six verbs in
   the same voice and tense in succession, a rhythmic arrangement like a
   hymn). Cf. Ro 8:29f. This time the verb is [analambanO], the verb used
   of the ascension (Ac 1:11, 22, which see). In a wonderful way this
   stanza of a hymn presents the outline of the life of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4

   4:1 Expressly [retOs]. Late adverb, here alone in N.T., from verbal
   adjective [retos] (from root [reO]. The reference is to the Holy
   Spirit, but whether to O.T. prophecy (Ac 1:16) or to some Christian
   utterance (2Th 2:2; 1Co 14:1ff.) we do not know. Parry recalls the
   words of Jesus in Mt 24:10,24. In later times [en husterois kairois].
   Old adjective (Mt 21:31) usually as adverb, [husteron] (Mt 4:2).
   Relative time from the prediction, now coming true (a present danger).

   [aphistemi], intransitive use, shall stand off from, to fall away,
   apostatize (2Co 12:8). From the faith [tes pisteOs]. Ablative case
   (separation). Not creed, but faith in God through Christ. Giving heed
   [prosechontes]. Supply [ton noun] (the mind) as in 3:8. Seducing

   active sense (deceiving). As substantive in 2Co 6:8. Probably some
   heathen or the worst of the Gnostics. Doctrines of devils [didaskaliais
   daimoniOn]. "Teachings of [daimons]." Definite explanation of the
   preceding. Cf. 1Co 10:20f.

   4:2 Through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies [en hupokrisei
   pseudologOn]. For [hupokrisis], see Ga 2:13. [Pseudologos] [pseudes,
   legO] Koine word from Aristophanes on. Here only in N.T. "A good
   classical word for liars on a large scale" (Parry). Branded in their
   own conscience as with a hot iron [kekausteriasmenOn ten idian
   suneidesin]. Accusative case [suneidesin] retained with the perfect
   passive participle of [kausteriazO], a rare verb only here and once in
   Strabo. Branded with the mark of Satan (2Ti 2:26) as Paul was with the
   marks of Christ (Ga 6:17). Agreeing in case with [pseudologOn].

   4:3 Forbidding to marry [kOluontOn gamein]. Present active participle
   of common verb [kOluO], to hinder, genitive case agreeing with
   [pseudologOn]. See Col 2:16, 21f., where Paul condemns the ascetic
   practices of the Gnostics. The Essenes, Therapeutae and other oriental
   sects forbade marriage. In 1Co 7 Paul does not condemn marriage. To
   abstain from meats [apechesthai brOmatOn]. Infinitive dependent, not on
   [kOluontOn], but on the positive idea [keleuontOn] (implied, not
   expressed). Ablative case of [brOmatOn] after [apechesthai] (present
   direct middle, to hold oneself away from). See 1Co 8-10; Ro 14; 15 for
   disputes about "meats offered to idols" and Col 1:22f. for the Gnostic
   asceticism. Which God created [ha ho theos ektisen]. First active
   indicative of [ktizO] (Co 1:16). Cf. 1Co 10:25. To be received [eis
   metalempsin]. "For reception." Old word, only here in N.T. By them that
   believe and know [tois pistois kai epegnOkosi]. Dative case, "for the
   believers and those who (one article unites closely) have known fully"
   (perfect active participle of [epiginOskO], a Pauline use of the word
   (Col 1:6).

   4:4 Creature [ktisma]. Late word from [ktizO], result of creating. See
   Ge 1:31; Mr 7:15; Ro 14:14 for the idea stated. To be rejected
   [apobleton]. Old verbal adjective in passive sense from [apoballO], to
   throw away, here only in N.T. If it be received [lambanomenon]. "Being
   received." Present passive participle of [lambanO], in conditional
   sense, "with thanksgiving."

   4:5 It is sanctified [hagiazetai]. Present passive indicative of
   [hagiazO], here "rendered holy" rather than "declared holy." Cf. verse
   4. Through the word of God and prayers [dia logou theou kai enteuxeOs].
   See 2:1 for [enteuxis]. Paul seems to refer to Genesis 1. It is almost
   a hendiadys "by the use of Scripture in prayer."

   4:6 If thou put the brethren in mind of these things [tauta
   hupotithemenos tois adelphois]. Present middle participle of
   [hupotithemi], to place under, to suggest, old and common verb, here
   only in N.T., "suggesting these things to the brethren." Thou shalt be
   a good minister of Christ Jesus [kalos esei diakonos Christou Iesou].
   This beautiful phrase covers one's whole service for Christ (3:1-7).
   Nourished in [entrephomenos]. Present passive participle of [entrephO],
   old verb, to nourish in, used by Plato of "nourished in the laws," here
   only in the N.T. The words of the faith [tois logois tes pisteOs].
   Locative case. The right diet for babes in Christ. The Bolshevists in
   Russia are feeding the children on atheism to get rid of God. Which
   thou hast followed [hei parekolouthekas]. Perfect active indicative of
   [parakoloutheO], old verb, to follow beside, of persons (often in old
   Greek) or of ideas and things (Lu 1:3; 1Ti 4:6; 2Ti 3:10). With
   associative instrumental case [hei] (which).

   4:7 Refuse [paraitou]. Present middle imperative second person singular
   of [paraiteO], old verb, to ask of one and then to beg off from one as
   in Lu 14:18f.; Ac 25:11; 1Ti 4:7; 5:11; Tit 3:10; 2Ti 2:23. Profane
   [bebelous]. See 1:9. Old wives' fables [graOdeis muthous]. On [muthos],
   see 1:4. [GraOdeis], late word (Strabo, Galen) from [graus], old woman,
   and [eidos] (look, appearance). Such as old women tell to children like
   the Gnostic aeons. Exercise thyself [gumnaze seauton]. Present active
   imperative of [gumnazO], originally to exercise naked [gumnos]. Old and
   common verb, but in N.T. only here and Heb 5:14; 12:11.

   4:8 Bodily exercise [he sOmatike gumnasia]. [Gumnasia] (from [gumnazO],
   also a common old word, here only in N.T. So also [sOmatike] (from
   [sOma], body) in N.T. only here and Lu 3:22. Profitable [Ophelimos].
   Another old word (from [OpheleO], to help, to profit), in N.T. only
   here, Tit 3:8; 2Ti 3:16. For a little [pros oligon]. "For little."
   Probably extent in contrast to [pros panta] (for all things), though in
   Jas 4:14 it is time "for a little while." Which now is [tes nun]. "The
   now life." Of that which is to come [tes mellouses]. "Of the coming
   (future) life."

   4:9 See 1:15 for these very words, but here the phrase points to the
   preceding words, not to the following as there.

   4:10 To this end [eis touto]. The godliness [eusebeia] of verse 8. See
   2Co 6:10 as Paul's own commentary. We labour [kopiOmen], Col 1:29) and
   strive [kai agOnizometha], Col 1:29). Both Pauline words. Because we
   have set our hope [hoti elpikamen]. Perfect active indicative of
   [elpizO] (Ro 15:12). Saviour of all men [sOter pantOn anthrOpOn]. See
   1:1 for [sOter] applied to God as here. Not that all men "are saved" in
   the full sense, but God gives life (6:13) to all (Ac 17:28). Specially
   of them that believe [malista pistOn]. Making a distinction in the
   kinds of salvation meant. "While God is potentially Saviour of all, He
   is actually Saviour of the [pistoi]" (White). So Jesus is termed
   "Saviour of the World" (Joh 4:42). Cf. Ga 6:10.

   4:12 Despise [kataphroneitO]. Imperative active third singular of
   [kataphroneO], old verb, to think down on, to despise (Ro 2:4). Thy
   youth [sou tes neotetos]. Genitive case of old word (from [neos] as in
   Mr 10:20. Be thou [ginou]. Present middle imperative of [ginomai].
   "Keep on becoming thou." An ensample [tupos]. Old word from [tuptO], a
   type. Pauline use of the word (1Th 1:7; 2Th 3:9; Php 3:17; Tit 2:7). To
   them that believe [tOn pistOn]. Objective genitive. In word [en logOi].
   In conversation as well as in public speech. In manner of life [en
   anastrophei]. "In bearing" (Ga 1:13; Eph 4:22). In purity [en
   hagneiai]. Old word from [hagneuO] [hagnos]. Sinlessness of life. Used
   of a Nazirite (Nu 6:2,21). Only here and 5:2 in N.T.

   4:13 Till I come [heOs erchomai]. "While I am coming" (present
   indicative with [heOs], not "till I come" [heOs elthO]. Give heed
   [proseche]. Present active imperative, supply [ton noun], "keep on
   putting thy mind on." The reading [tei anagnOsei]. Old word from
   [anaginOskO]. See 2Co 3:14. Probably in particular the public reading
   of the Scriptures (Ac 13:15), though surely private reading is not to
   be excluded. To exhortation [tei paraklesei], to teaching [tei
   didaskaliai]. Two other public functions of the minister. Probably Paul
   does not mean for the exhortation to precede the instruction, but the
   reverse in actual public work. Exhortation needs teaching to rest it
   upon, a hint for preachers today.

   4:14 Neglect not [me amelei]. Present active imperative in prohibition
   of [ameleO], old verb, rare in N.T. (Mt 22:5; 1Ti 4:14; Heb 2:3; 8:9).
   From [ameles] [a] privative and [melei], not to care). Use with
   genitive. The gift that is in thee [tou en soi charismatos]. Late word
   of result from [charizomai], in papyri (Preisigke), a regular Pauline
   word in N.T. (1Co 1:7; 2Co 1:11; Ro 1:11; etc.). Here it is God's gift
   to Timothy as in 2Ti 1:6. By prophecy [dia propheteias]. Accompanied by
   prophecy (1:18), not bestowed by prophecy. With the laying on of the
   hands of the presbytery [meta epitheseOs tOn cheirOn tou presbuteriou].
   In Ac 13:2f., when Barnabas and Saul were formally set apart to the
   mission campaign (not then ordained as ministers, for they were already
   that), there was the call of the Spirit and the laying on of hands with
   prayer. Here again [meta] does not express instrument or means, but
   merely accompaniment. In 2Ti 1:6 Paul speaks only of his own laying on
   of hands, but the rest of the presbytery no doubt did so at the same
   time and the reference is to this incident. There is no way to tell
   when and where it was done, whether at Lystra when Timothy joined
   Paul's party or at Ephesus just before Paul left Timothy there (1:3).
   [Epithesis] [from epitithemi], to lay upon) is an old word, in LXX,
   etc. In the N.T. we find it only here, 2Ti 1:16; Ac 8:18; Heb 6:2, but
   the verb [epitithemi] with [tas cheiras] more frequently (Ac 6:6 of the
   deacons; 8:19; 13:3; 1Ti 5:22, etc.). [Presbuterion] is a late word
   (ecclesiastical use also), first for the Jewish Sanhedrin (Lu 22:66; Ac
   22:5), then (here only in N.T.) of Christian elders (common in
   Ignatius), though [presbuteros] (elder) for preachers (bishops) is
   common (Ac 11:30; 15:2; 20:17, etc.).

   4:15 Be diligent in these things [tauta meleta]. Old verb from [melete]
   (care, practice), present active imperative, "keep on practising these
   things." In N.T. only here and Ac 4:25. Give thyself wholly to them [en
   toutois isthi]. Present imperative second person singular of [eimi],
   "keep on in these things." Note five uses of [en] in verse 12 and three
   datives in verse 14. Plutarch (Pomp. 656 B) says Caesar was [en
   toutois] ("in these things"). It is like our "up to his ears" in work
   [in medias res] and sticking to his task. Thy progress [sou he
   prokope]. Koine word from [prokoptO], to cut forward, to blaze the way,
   in N.T. only here and Php 1:12,25. Paul's concern (purpose, [hina] and
   present subjunctive [ei] of [eimi] is that Timothy's "progress" may be
   "manifest to all." It is inspiring to see a young preacher grow for
   then the church will grow with him.

   4:16 Take heed to thyself [epeche seautOi]. Present active imperative
   of old verb [epechO], to hold upon (Php 2:1,16), but here [ton noun]
   (the mind) must be supplied as in Ac 3:5 and as is common with
   [prosechO]. With dative case [seautOi]. "Keep on paying attention to
   thyself." Some young preachers are careless about their health and
   habits. Some are too finical. And to the teaching [kai tei
   didaskaliai]. This is important also. Continue in these things [epimene
   autois]. Present active imperative of [epimenO], old and common verb to
   stay by the side of a person or thing. See Ro 6:1; Col 1:23. "Stay by
   them," "stick to them," "see them through." "Stick to the business of
   framing your own life and your teaching on right lines" (Parry). Thou
   shalt save [sOseis]. Future active of [sOzO], effective future, finally
   save. Cf. 1Co 9:27; Joh 10:9.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 5

   5:1 Rebuke not an elder [presbuterOi me epiplexeis]. Dative case
   [presbuterOi] used in the usual sense of an older man, not a minister
   (bishop as in 3:2) as is shown by "as a father." First aorist
   (ingressive) active subjunctive with negative [me] (prohibition against
   committing the act) of [epiplessO], to strike upon, old verb, but here
   only in N.T. and in figurative sense with words rather than with fists.
   Respect for age is what is here commanded, an item appropriate to the
   present time. The younger men as brethren [neOterous hOs adelphous].
   Comparative adjective [neOteros] from [neos] (young). No article,
   "younger men." Wise words for the young minister to know how to conduct
   himself with old men (reverence) and young men (fellowship, but not
   stooping to folly with them).

   5:2 The elder women as mothers [presbuteras hOs meteras]. Anarthrous
   again, "older women as mothers." Respect and reverence once more. The
   younger as sisters, in all purity [neOteras hOs adelphas en pasei
   hagniai]. Anarthrous also and comparative form as in verse 1. See 4:12
   for [hagnia]. No sort of behavior will so easily make or mar the young
   preacher as his conduct with young women.

   5:3 That are widows indeed [tas ontOs cheras]. For [ontOs] (actually,
   really), see Lu 23:47; 1Co 14:25; and verse 5. For widows [chera] see
   Mr 12:40,42; Ac 6:1; 1Co 7:8. Parry notes that in verses 3-8 Paul
   discusses widows who are in distress and 9-16 those who are in the
   employment of the local church for certain work. Evidently, as in Acts
   6:1-6, so here in Ephesus there had arisen some trouble over the widows
   in the church. Both for individual cases of need and as a class Timothy
   is to show proper respect [tima], keep on honouring) the widows.

   5:4 Grandchildren [ekgona]. Old word from [ekginomai], here only in
   N.T. Let them learn [manthanetOsan]. The children and grandchildren of
   a widow. Present active imperative third person plural of [manthanO].
   "Let them keep on learning." First [prOton]. Adverb, first before
   anything else. No "corban" business here. No acts of "piety" toward God
   will make up for impiety towards parents. To shew piety [eusebein].
   Present active infinitive with [manthanetOsan] and old verb, in N.T.
   only here and Ac 17:23. From [eusebes] [eu, sebomai], pious, dutiful.
   Their own family [ton idion oikon]. "Their own household." Filial piety
   is primary unless parents interfere with duty to Christ (Lu 14:26). To
   requite [amoibas apodidonai]. Present active infinitive of [apodidOmi],
   to give back, old and common verb (Ro 2:6), to keep on giving back.
   [Amoibas] (from [ameibomai], to requite like for like) is old and
   common word, but here only in N.T. Their parents [tois progonois].
   Dative case of old and common word [progonos] (from [proginomai], to
   come before), "ancestor." In N.T. only here and 2Ti 1:3. See 2:3 for
   "acceptable" [apodekton].

   5:5 Desolate [memonOmene]. Perfect passive participle of [monoO] (from
   [monos], "left alone," old verb, here alone in N.T. Without husband,
   children, or other close kin. Hath her hope set on God [elpiken epi
   theon]. Perfect active indicative of [elpizO], "hath placed her hope
   (and keeps it) on God." Text doubtful whether God [theon] or Lord
   [Kurion]. Continues [prosmenei]. See on 1:3. With dative case here.
   Night and day [nuktos kai hemeras]. "By night and by day" (genitive,
   not accusative). Paul does not say that she should pray "all night and
   day."

   5:6 She that giveth herself to pleasure [he spatalOsa]. Present active
   participle of [splatalaO], late verb (Polybius) from [spatale]
   (riotous, luxurious living). In N.T. only here and Jas 5:5.

   5:7 That they may be without reproach [hina anepilemptoi Osin]. See 3:2
   for [anepilemptos]. Final clause with [hina] and present subjunctive.

   5:8 Provideth not for his own [tOn idiOn ou pronoei]. Condition of
   first class with [ei] and present active (or middle [pronoeitai]
   indicative of [pronoeO], old verb, to think beforehand. Pauline word in
   N.T. only here, 2Co 8:21; Ro 12:7. With genitive case. He hath denied
   the faith [ten pistin ernetai]. Perfect middle indicative of old verb
   [arneomai]. His act of impiety belies (Tit 1:16) his claim to the faith
   (Re 2:13). Worse than an unbeliever [apistou cheirOn]. Ablative case of
   [apistou] after the comparative [cheirOn]. Who makes no profession of
   piety.

   5:9 Let none be enrolled as a widow [chera katalegesthO]. Present
   passive imperative of [katalegO], old verb, to set down in an official
   list, only here in N.T. "Let a widow be enrolled," the negative coming
   later, "having become of no less than sixty years" [me elatton etOn
   hexekonta gegonuia]. Second perfect active participle of [ginomai]. For
   the case of [etOn], see Lu 2:42. This list of genuine widows (verses 3,
   5) apparently had some kind of church work to do (care for the sick,
   the orphans, etc.). The wife of one man [henos andros gune]. Widows on
   this list must not be married a second time. This interpretation is not
   so clear for 3:2, 12; Tit 1:6.

   5:10 If she hath brought up children [ei eteknotrophesen]. Condition of
   first class. Late and rare word (Aristotle, Epictetus), first aorist
   active indicative of [teknotropheO] [teknotrophos], from [teknon,
   trephO], here only in N.T. Qualification for her work as leader. If she
   hath used hospitality to strangers [ei exenodochesen]. First aorist
   again and same condition. Late form (Dio Cassius) of old verb
   [xenodokeO] (Herodotus), to welcome strangers [xenous dechomai]. Only
   here in N.T. Hospitality another qualification for such leadership
   (3:2). If she hath washed the saints' feet [ei hagiOn podas enipsen].
   Same condition and tense of [niptO] (old form [nizO], common in N.T.
   (Joh 13:5). Proof of her hospitality, not of its being a church
   ordinance. If she hath relieved the afflicted [ei thlibomenois
   eperkesen]. Same condition and tense of [eparkeO], to give sufficient
   aid, old word, in N.T. only here and verse 16. Experience that
   qualified her for eleemosynary work. If she hath diligently followed
   [ei epekolouthesen]. Same condition and tense of [epakoloutheO], old
   verb, to follow close upon [epi]. So here, verse 24; 1Pe 2:21. In a
   word such a widow must show her qualifications for leadership as with
   bishops and deacons.

   5:11 But younger widows refuse [neOteras de cheras paraitou]. Present
   middle imperative as in 4:7. "Beg off from." They lack experience as
   above and they have other ambitions. When they have waxed wanton [hotan
   katastreniasOsin]. First aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of
   [katastreniaO], late compound (only here and Ignatius), to feel the
   impulse of sexual desire, but simplex [streniaO] (Re 18:7,9). Souter
   renders it here "exercise youthful vigour against Christ" [tou
   Christou], genitive case after [kata] in composition).

   5:12 Condemnation [krima]. See 3:6. They have rejected [ethetesan].
   First aorist passive of [atheteO], late verb (first in LXX and
   Polybius), to reject, set aside (from [athetos]. See 1Th 4:8; Ga 2:21.
   Their first faith [ten prOten pistin]. "Their first pledge" (promise,
   contract) to Christ. It is like breaking the marriage contract.
   Evidently one of the pledges on joining the order of widows was not to
   marry. Parry suggests a kind of ordination as with deacons and bishops
   (technical use of [krima] and [pistis].

   5:13 And withal [hama de kai]. See Phm 1:22 for this very phrase, "and
   at the same time also." Such young enrolled widows have other perils
   also. They learn to be idle [argai manthanousin]. There is no [einai]
   (to be) in the Greek. This very idiom without [einai] after [manthanO]
   occurs in Plato and Dio Chrysostom, though unusual. [Argai] (idle) is
   old adjective [a] privative and [ergon], without work). See Mt 20:3;
   Tit 1:12. Going about [perierchomenai]. Present middle participle of
   [perierchomai], old compound verb. See Ac 19:13 of strollers. From
   house to house [tas oikias]. Literally "the houses," "wandering around
   the houses." Vivid picture of idle tattlers and gossipers. But tattlers
   also [alla kai phluaroi]. Old word from [phluO] (to boil up, to throw
   up bubbles, like blowing soap bubbles). Only here in N.T. [PhluareO] in
   3Jo 1:10 only in N.T. And busybodies [kai periergoi]. Old word (from
   [peri, ergon], busy about trifles to the neglect of important matters.
   In N.T. only here and Ac 19:19. See 2Th 3:11 for [periergazomai].
   Things which they ought not [ta me deonta]. "The not necessary things,"
   and, as a result, often harmful. See Tit 1:11 [ha me dei] (which things
   are not necessary).

   5:14 I desire [boulomai]. See 2:8. The younger widows [neOteras]. No
   article and no word for widows, though that is clearly the idea.
   [NeOteras] is accusative of general reference with [gamein] (to marry)
   the object (present infinitive active) of [boulomai]. Bear children
   [teknogonein]. A compound verb here only in N.T. and nowhere else save
   in Anthol. See [teknogonia] in 2:15. Rule the household
   [oikodespotein]. Late verb from [oikodespotes] (Mr 14:14), twice in the
   papyri, only here in N.T. Note that the wife is here put as ruler of
   the household, proper recognition of her influence, "new and improved
   position" (Liddon) . Occasion [aphormen]. Old word [apo, horme], a base
   to rush from, Pauline use in 2Co 5:12; 11:12; Ga 5:13. To the adversary
   [tOi antikeimenOi]. Dative case of the articular participle of
   [antikeimai], a Pauline idiom (Php 1:28). Reviling [loidorias]. Old
   word (from [loidoreO], in N.T. only here and 1Pe 3:9. Genitive case
   with [charin].

   5:15 Are turned aside [exetrapesan]. Second aorist (effective) passive
   indicative of [ektrepO]. See 1:6. After Satan [opisO tou Satana].
   "Behind Satan." Late use of [opisO] (behind) as a preposition. Used by
   Jesus of disciples coming behind (after) him (Mt 16:24).

   5:16 That believeth [piste]. "Believing woman." Hath widows [echei
   cheras]. The "any believing woman" is one of the household-rulers of
   verse 14. The "widows" here are the widows dependent on her and who are
   considered as candidates to be enrolled in the list. Let her relieve
   them [eparkeitO autais]. For this verb (imperative present active) see
   verse 10. Let not be burdened [me bareisthO]. Present passive
   imperative (in prohibition [me] of [bareO], old verb [baros], burden),
   Pauline word (2Co 1:8). That are widows indeed [tais ontOs cherais].
   Dative case with [eparkesei] (first aorist active subjunctive with
   [hina], final clause). See verse 3 for this use of [ontOs] with
   [cherais] "the qualified and enrolled widows." Cf. verse 9.

   5:17 The elders that rule well [hoi kalOs proestOtes presbuteroi]. See
   verse 1 for ordinary sense of [presbuteros] for "older man." But here
   of position in same sense as [episkopos] (3:2) as in Tit 1:5 =
   [episkopos] in verse 7. Cf. Luke's use of [presbuteros] (Ac 20:17) =
   Paul's [episkopous] (Ac 20:28). [ProestOtes] is second perfect active
   participle of [proistemi] (intransitive use) for which see 3:4. Let be
   counted worthy [axiousthOsan]. Present passive imperative of [axioO],
   to deem worthy (2Th 1:11). With genitive case here. Of double honour
   [diples times]. Old and common contract adjective [diploos], two-fold,
   in opposition to [haploos], single fold). But why "of double honour"?
   See 6:1 for "of all honour." White suggests "remuneration" rather than
   "honour" for [times] (a common use for price or pay). Liddon proposes
   "honorarium" (both honour and pay and so "double"). Wetstein gives
   numerous examples of soldiers receiving double pay for unusual
   services. Some suggest twice the pay given the enrolled widows.
   Especially those who labour in word and teaching [malista hoi kopiOntes
   en logOi kai didaskaliai]. Either those who work hard or toil (usual
   meaning of [kopiaO], 2Ti 2:6) in preaching and teaching (most probable
   meaning. See verse 18) or those who teach and preach and not merely
   preside (a doubtful distinction in "elders" at this time). See Tit
   1:8f. See both [kopiaO] and [proistamai] used for same men (elders) in
   1Th 5:12 and the use of [kopiaO] in 1Co 15:10; 16:16.

   5:18 Thou shalt not muzzle [ou phimOseis]. Prohibition by [ou] and
   future (volitive) indicative of [phimoO] (from [phimos], muzzle), old
   word, quoted also in 1Co 9:9 as here from De 25:4, and for the same
   purpose, to show the preacher's right to pay for his work. See 1Co 9:9
   for [aloOnta] (when he treadeth out the corn). The labourer is worthy
   of his hire [axios ho ergates tou misthou autou]. These words occur in
   precisely this form in Lu 10:7. It appears also in Mt 10:10 with [tes
   trophes] (food) instead of [tou misthou]. In 1Co 9:14 Paul has the
   sense of it and says: "so also the Lord ordained," clearly meaning that
   Jesus had so said. It only remains to tell whether Paul here is quoting
   an unwritten saying of Jesus as he did in Ac 20:35 or even the Gospel
   of Luke or Q (the Logia of Jesus). There is no way to decide this
   question. If Luke wrote his Gospel before A.D. 62 as is quite possible
   and Acts by A.D. 63, he could refer to the Gospel. It is not clear
   whether Scripture is here meant to apply to this quotation from the
   Lord Jesus. For [ergates] (labourer) see Php 3:2.

   5:19 Against an elder [kata presbuterou]. In the official sense of
   verses 17f. Receive not [me paradechou]. Present middle imperative with
   [me] (prohibition) of [paradechomai], to receive, to entertain. Old
   verb. See Ac 22:18. Accusation [kategorian]. Old word (from
   [kategoros]. In N.T. only here, Tit 1:6; Joh 18:29 in critical text.
   Except [ektos ei me]. For this double construction see 1Co 14:5; 15:2.
   At the mouth of [epi]. Idiomatic use of [epi] (upon the basis of) as in
   2Co 13:1.

   5:20 Them that sin [tous hamartanontas]. The elders who continue to sin
   (present active participle). In the sight of all [enOpion pantOn]. "In
   the eye of [ho en opi On], the one who is in the eye of, then combined
   = [enOpion] all" the elders (or even of the church). See next verse 21
   and Ga 1:20. Public rebuke when a clear case, not promiscuous gossip.
   May be in fear [phobon echOsin]. Present active subjunctive with [hina]
   (final clause), "may keep on having fear" (of exposure). Possibly, "the
   rest of the elders."

   5:21 The elect angels [tOn eklektOn aggelOn]. For this triad of God,
   Christ, angels, see Lu 9:26. "Elect" in the sense of the "holy" angels
   who kept their own principality (Jude 1:6) and who did not sin (2Pe
   2:4). Paul shows his interest in angels in 1Co 4:9; 11:10. Observe
   [phulaxeis]. First aorist active subjunctive of [phulassO], to guard,
   to keep (Ro 2:26). Subfinal use of [hina]. Without prejudice [chOris
   prokrimatos]. Late and rare word (from [prokinO], to judge beforehand),
   three times in the papyri, here only in N.T. "Without prejudgment." By
   partiality [kata prosklisin]. Late word from [prosklinO], to incline
   towards one (Ac 5:36), only here in N.T.

   5:22 Lay hands hastily [cheiras tacheOs epitithei]. Present active
   imperative of [epitithemi] in the sense of approval (ordination) as in
   Ac 6:6; 13:3. But it is not clear whether it is the case of ministers
   just ordained as in 4:14 [epithesis], or of warning against hasty
   ordination of untried men, or the recognition and restoration of
   deposed ministers (verse 20) as suits the context. The prohibition
   suits either situation, or both. Be partakers of other men's sins
   [koinOnei hamartiais allotriais]. Present active imperative of
   [koinOneO] (from [koinOnos], partner) with [me] in prohibition with
   associative instrumental case as in 2Jo 1:11; Ro 12:13. On [allotrios]
   (belonging to another) see Ro 14:4. Keep thyself pure [seauton hagnon
   terei]. "Keep on keeping thyself pure." Present active imperative of
   [tereO].

   5:23 Be no longer a drinker of water [meketi hudropotei]. Present
   active imperative (prohibition) of [hudropoteO], old verb (from
   [hudropotes], water drinker, [hudOr, pinO], here only in N.T. Not
   complete asceticism, but only the need of some wine urged in Timothy's
   peculiar physical condition (a sort of medical prescription for this
   case). But use a little wine [alla ainOi oligOi chrO]. Present middle
   imperative of [chraomai] with instrumental case. The emphasis is on
   [oligOi] (a little). For thy stomach's sake [dia ton stomachon]. Old
   word from [stoma] (mouth). In Homer throat, opening of the stomach
   (Aristotle), stomach in Plutarch. Here only in N.T. Our word "stomach."
   Thine often infirmities [tas puknas sou astheneias]. [Puknos] is old
   word, dense, frequent. In N.T. only here, Lu 5:33; Ac 24:26.

   in N.T. only here and Heb 7:24. Going before unto judgment [proagousai
   eis krisin]. See 1:18 for [proagO]. The sins are so plain that they
   receive instant condemnation. And some men also they follow after
   [tisin de kai epakolouthousin]. Associative instrumental case [tisin]
   with [epakolouthousin] for which verb see verse 10, "dog their steps"
   (Parry) like 1Pe 2:21, not clearly manifest at first, but come out
   plainly at last. How true that is of secret sins.

Chapter 6

   6:1 Under the yoke [hupo zugon]. As slaves [douloi], bondsmen). Perhaps
   under heathen masters (1Pe 2:18). For the slave problem, see also Phm
   1; Col 3:22; Eph 6:5; Tit 2:9. See Mt 11:29 for Christ's "yoke"
   [zugon], from [zeugnumi], to join). Their own masters [tous idious
   despotas]. That is always where the shoe pinches. Our "despot" is this
   very Greek word, the strict correlative of slave [doulos], while
   [kurios] has a wider outlook. Old word only here, Tit 2:9; 2Ti 2:21;
   1Pe 2:18 for human masters. Applied to God in Lu 2:29; Ac 4:24, 29 and
   to Christ in 2Pe 2:1. The name of God [to onoma tou theou]. See Ro
   2:24. If the heathen could say that Christian slaves were not as

   6:2 Let not despise them [me kataphroneitOsan]. Negative imperative
   active third plural of [kataphroneO], to think down on. See 4:12. He
   must not presume on the equality of Christian brotherhood not allowed
   by the state's laws. Some of these Christian slaves might be pastors of
   churches to which the master belonged. For the difficulty of the
   Christian master's position, see 1Co 7:22; Phm 1:16. But rather [alla
   mallon]. Render the Christian Master better service. They that partake
   of the benefit [hoi tes energesias antilambanomenoi]. For [euergesias]

   [me] instead of [ou]. [Proserchomai] (old verb, to come to, to
   approach, with dative) is common enough in N.T. (Heb 4:16; 7:25, etc.),

   sayings in Lock's opinion like 5:18; Ac 20:35, at least in the Spirit

   kinds of evil [riza pantOn tOn kakOn]. A root [riza]. Old word, common
   in literal (Mt 3:10) and metaphorical sense (Ro 11:11-18). Field (Ot.
   Norv.) argues for "the root" as the idea of this predicate without
   saying that it is the only root. Undoubtedly a proverb that Paul here
   quotes, attributed to Bion and to Democritus [ten philargurian einai
   metropolin pantOn tOn kakOn], where "metropolis" takes the place of
   "root." Surely men today need no proof of the fact that men and women
