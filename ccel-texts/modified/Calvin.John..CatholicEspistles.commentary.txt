   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   THE Dedication to King Edward the Sixth is remarkably interesting, as
   it refers to the character of Popery at that day, and to its manoeuvres
   with regard to a General Council. The language is strong, and perhaps
   rougher than what would be at present used, but still true according to
   all we gather from history as to the state of things in those days. The
   main principles of Popery are still the same, and similar are its
   proceedings, though they may be more disguised, and its spirit is
   equally intolerant and persecuting. Like Mahomedanism, it is exclusive,
   and ever injurious to the harmony and peace of society.

   The order in which the Epistles are arranged is not the same as in our
   version. There has not been a uniformity in this respect among the
   ancients. The reason for the arrangement here adopted was probably
   this, that the First Epistle of Peter, and the First of John, had, from
   the beginning, been universally acknowledged as genuine, while the
   Epistle of James, the Second of Peter, and that of Jude, had not from
   the first been universally received as canonical, though they were
   eventually so received. The Second and the Third Epistle of John were
   evidently not deemed by Calvin as "catholic;" and for this reason, as
   it seems, he omitted them.

   The word "Catholic," or General, as applied to the Epistles here
   explained, has been differently understood. Some have thought that they
   have been thus called, because they contain catholic truths; but other
   Epistles might, for this reason, be also called catholic. Others have
   supposed that catholic is synonymous with canonical; but in this case
   also there is no more reason for applying the word to these Epistles
   than to any other Epistles. But the more probable opinion is, that they
   were called Catholic, or General, because they were not written to any
   particular Church, but to Jewish or to Gentile Christians generally.
   Moreover, the term was not given them at first, but in subsequent ages.

   The most probable dates of the five Epistles here explained are the
   following: --

   BOOK

                               DATE

   The Epistle of James,

                               A.D. 61

   The First Epistle of Peter,

                               A.D. 65

   The Second Epistle of Peter,

                               A.D. 65

   The Epistle of Jude,

                               A.D. 66

   The First, Epistle of John

                               A.D. 68


   This is the order according to the dates most approved by the learned.
   There is, for the most part, a unanimity as to the dates of the three
   first Epistles; but with regard to the Epistle of Jude, and the First
   Epistle of John, there is not the same agreement. There are many who
   fix later dates: to Jude, 90, and to John, 91 or 92. But this is a
   matter of no great consequence.

   No doubt can be justly entertained but that James, called the Less, was
   the author of the Epistle. He was the son of Alphaeus or Cleopas, and
   of Mary, probably a cousin, not a sister, of Mary the mother of our
   Lord. Hence he is called our Lord's brother, (Galatians 1:19;) that is,
   a near relative, as the Word brother is often taken in Scripture. He
   took a leading part in the council held at Jerusalem, mentioned in Acts
   15; and, according to Jerome, he resided there thirty years, and
   presided over the Church. He was put to death, as Hegesippus relates,
   who flourished in the second century, by a tumultuous mob, excited by
   Jewish zealots, in the year 62.

   The canonicity of James's Epistle has been a subject of dispute, though
   almost universally allowed in the present day. The facts respecting it,
   according to Basnage, are these, -- During the three first centuries it
   was not extensively known; in the fourth century its authenticity was
   by some disputed; but in the fifth century it was universally
   acknowledged as genuine; and it has ever since been so acknowledged,
   with a very few exceptions. What seems to be a sufficient evidence in
   its favor is the fact, that it is found as a part of Holy Scripture in
   the first Syriac Version, which was made early in the second century.

   The occasion of writing the Epistle appears to have been the abuse made
   of the doctrine of free grace by professing Christians, -- a subject
   referred to also by Paul in Romans vi., and in his other Epistles.
   Abounding grace is at one time despised and rejected; at another time
   it is turned into licentiousness: these are evils which have ever
   prevailed in the Church. The Pharisee is too proud to receive grace;
   the Antinomian pretends to receive and magnify grace, that he may
   gratify the inclinations of his sinful nature. It was against the
   Antinomian that James wrote his Epistle.

   According to Lardner and Macknight, the Epistle was addressed to the
   whole Jewish nation, at home and abroad, believers and unbelievers;
   according to Grotius and Wall, to the Jews dispersed abroad
   indiscriminately, believing and unbelieving; according to Michaelis, to
   the believing Jews, while the unbelieving were not overlooked; but
   according to Beza and Scott, to the scattered Jews who professed the
   Christian faith. And this last opinion has the strongest reasons and
   evidence in its favor. [1]

   With regard to the First Epistle of Peter, there has never been a doubt
   respecting its genuineness. This Apostle took a prominent part at first
   in the cause of Christianity, but of his labors after the council at
   Jerusalem, in the year 49, recorded in Acts 15, we have no account in
   Scripture. Mention is indeed made, in Galatians 2:11, of his being
   afterwards at Antioch. It has been justly concluded from the
   superscription of this Epistle that he exercised his ministry in those
   parts which are here mentioned.

   It was thought by Beza and Grotius that the Epistle was addressed to
   converted Jews; but by Doddridge, Macknight, and Scott, to Christians
   in general, both Jews and Gentiles. The latter opinion is the most
   probable. The arguments assigned by Horne, in his Introduction, in
   favor of the former opinion, are by no means satisfactory.

   With regard to the Second Epistle of Peter, doubts have been
   entertained by some as to its authenticity. It appears that it was not
   at first so widely known as his First Epistle; and this was probably
   the reason why there were some during the first three centuries who did
   not regard it as genuine. But it has been quoted as a part of Scripture
   by some of the earliest Fathers, and fully acknowledged as authentic by
   those of the fourth and succeeding centuries.

   The First Epistle of John has from the beginning been uniformly
   received as a portion of Divine Revelation. Some difference has existed
   as to the persons for whom it was especially intended, -- a matter of
   no great importance. Some have supposed it to have been written for the
   Jewish Christians in Judea; but others, with more probability, for
   Christians generally, both Jewish and Gentile.

   Though there is no name attached to it, yet there has been universal
   consent from the beginning that John was its author; and indeed the
   style of it throughout is sufficient to shew that he was the writer of
   it; for his Gospel and the Book of Revelation are in this respect
   exactly alike; and it is a style peculiarly his own.

   Jude, or Judas, was, as he says, the brother of James, and therefore
   the son of Alphaeus or Cleopas. Though he does not call himself an
   apostle, yet he proved himself to be so by saying that he was the
   brother of James. He is called, as James was, the brother of our Lord,
   Matthew 13:55. We have in Scripture no account of his ministry after
   the day of Pentecost.

   His Epistle was not at first universally received as canonical. This is
   acknowledged by Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome; at the same time, they
   themselves so regarded it; and Jerome says that in his day it was by
   most received as genuine; and it has been quoted as a part of Scripture
   by Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Cyril of Jerusalem, Athanasius,
   Ambrose, and Augustine. [2]

   That some of the Epistles were not universally received as authentic at
   first is no matter of wonder, when we consider the scattered condition
   of the Church, and the scanty means of communication. The fact, that
   some had doubts respecting them does not in the least degree invalidate
   their genuineness; on the contrary, it has conduced to strengthen the
   evidence in their favor; for the doubts of some must have occasioned a
   more minute inquiry as to their authenticity. And it was not long
   before all the Epistles, about which there had been some doubts, had
   attained the universal approbation of the Church; and what Lardner
   states is worthy of special attention, -- That no writings, received by
   the primitive Church as genuine, have been since proved to be spurious;
   and that no writings, regarded by it as spurious, have been since
   proved to be genuine.

   The Editor must mention here, what perhaps he ought to have mentioned
   before, -- that in his translations he has not always retained what is
   called the historical present tense, which is often used by Calvin,
   according to the practice of Latin and Greek writers, and also of the
   Prophets and the Evangelists. This mode of writing does not accord with
   the usage of the present day.

   Our translators have not been uniform in this respect either in the New
   or the Old Testament; for they sometimes departed from the original as
   to this tense, though, for the most part, they retained it. As, for
   instance, in John 11:39-40, the historical present is not retained in
   the 39th, while it is retained in the 40th verse. The anomalies as to
   the tenses often met with, especially in the Psalms, have arisen from
   overlooking this peculiarity. The future in Hebrew is very often used
   for the present; and this is the historical present, and ought to be
   rendered in our language in the past tense.

   DEDICATION

   TO HIS MOST SERENE HIGHNESS,

   EDWARD THE SIXTH

   THE KING OF ENGLAND, THE LORD OF IRELAND, AND A MOST CHRISTIAN PRINCE,

   JOHN CALVIN.

   Behold, I return to you again, most excellent King. For though I did
   not expect that the Commentaries on Isaiah, which I lately dedicated to
   your Majesty, were a worthy gift, yet it was offered with my hearty
   good wishes. I have, therefore, thought of adding the Catholic
   Epistles, as they are commonly called, as a supplement to make up a
   full measure, so that both might come to your hands at the same time.
   And doubtless, since they were written either to Gentiles far distant,
   or to such as inhabited various countries far asunder, it is nothing
   new to them to pass over the sea, and to make a long circuit in coming
   to your Majesty. At the same time I thus as a private individual offer
   to you, most illustrious King, my labors, that being published under
   your name, they may profit all.

   And truly, if there has ever been a time when the truth of God ought to
   have been freely and boldly maintained, it has never been more
   necessary than in the present day, as all must see. Not to mention the
   atrocious cruelty exercised towards its professors, to omit also all
   those machinations by which Satan fights against it, sometimes covertly
   and sometimes openly, there are places in which the pure doctrine of
   Religion lately prevailed, but where now the satellites of the Roman
   Antichrist, by their spurious deformations so mock Christ as though
   they gave a reed in his hand instead of a scepter, and laid a crown of
   thorns on his head. When these crafty corrupters of the purity of the
   Gospel hope by their arts gradually to extinguish it, with what
   cowardice do they connive at these mockeries offered to Christ, who
   ought to have hazarded their life a hundred times rather than to redeem
   it for a very short time by their perfidious silence?

   In the meantime, the Pope himself, to complete the last tragedy of
   crucifying the Son of God, is said to have summoned again his own
   masked council. Though he marches with his savage soldiery to
   obliterate the name of Christ and to destroy his Church, yet every kind
   of council is to him as a sacred sword, to make slaughter as it were a
   solemn rite. Thus Paulus the Third, when he had resolved to kill and
   destroy all by whom the defense of truth was preferred to their own
   life, made a show at Trent of that odious spectre, though disguised in
   fine colors, that he might put an end to the Gospel as it were by its
   thunders. But all that preparation, when the good fathers had begun,
   through some gleams emitted at the sessions, to dazzle the eyes of the
   simple, was put an end to by a secret and sudden blast from the holy
   seat, and vanished into smoke, except that for the purpose of
   continuing the terror, a little cloud rested for a time on Bononia.

   Hence Julius, his successor, who had performed his part previously at
   Trent, is said to be preparing himself now for this stratagem, as
   though this only remained as means to obliterate the Gospel from the
   memory of men, that is, to fulminate against us with the horrible and
   terrific decrees of council; though many think that he only makes a
   pretense. But it signifies but little whether he pretends or really
   means to call a council. It is indeed a thing clear and well proved,
   that since the Papacy began to decline through the efforts of Luther,
   whoever occupied that citadel of tyranny, though they might hope to
   obtain some support from a council, they yet have shunned this kind of
   remedy in way similar to a sick man, who, being all over full of
   ulcers, dreads even the touch of the most tender physician. Therefore
   common even among children is the saying, that the Papacy cannot
   otherwise be assisted by a council than by cauterizing or amputation.

   But I see no cause why the Popes dread councils so much, except that
   fear is an inseparable companion of a bad conscience. For what, I pray,
   was the late rabble at Trent, (to which yet they gave the name of a
   holy, general, and ecumenical synod,) but a sort of empty apparition,
   which no more disturbed the pleasures of the Pope than the clangor of
   trumpets, or the sound of drums, with which he daily amuses himself?
   Were, indeed, a synod from all parts really assembled, here might be
   some cause of fear, lest a disturbance, arising in so great a
   multitude, should occasion a greater tumult. But by such fictitious
   councils as that of Trent, who can believe that a Pope could be
   terrified any more than by children's rattles, but that on the contrary
   he would sweetly slumber as through the blandishments of a quieter
   sleep? For example, two or three cardinals shall be chosen by the Pope,
   being his bosom friends, who shall wield all the authority. The same
   tyrant will hire from his courtiers some greedy fellow for a few ducats
   a month, who, being clothed in the mask of a patriarch, will servilely
   declare as his own opinion what had been dictated to him. Such was that
   blind Robert at Trent, whom I saw some time ago at Ratisbon, busying
   himself, not less foolishly than wickedly, in behalf of the Pope, when
   by his inveiglements he tried to draw me to a conference with
   Contarenus. There will fly together from all Italy the three-halfpenny
   bishops, of whom there will be a vast abundance. There will come also
   from France and Spain some of the light-headed and fatuitous, and
   others infamous for the vices of their former life; who afterwards
   returning home will boast that they had rendered a good and faithful
   service to the Catholic Church. Moreover, there will come forth from
   the caves of monks a great conflux of frogs into that marsh, who by
   their eager croaking will banish far away every truth. What! do I
   imagine here a new thing, or do I not, on the contrary, correctly
   describe the assembly which was lately seen at Trent?

   Why then is it that the Pope dreads these guardians of his own
   tribunal, who are all, in the first place, his own servile creatures;
   and who, in the second place, seek no other thing than to gain by any
   means his favor?

   Our Julius especially, who is a veteran in matters of this kind, can in
   mockery, whenever he pleases, compose such a council as this, so as, in
   the meantime, to leave as usual the thing undone. And, indeed, as he
   has given to many of the Dominicans the red cap, it seems to be no
   obscure prelude of such an event. This order, as they say, has ever
   been in favor with him; but such profusion arises from a higher cause.
   He, indeed, knows well, that none are more shameless than these
   beggarly fellows, as he has often employed at his nod their illiberal
   and sordid services. When he raised them again to this dignity, he knew
   that whatever he might bid them to do, none would be more audacious or
   more cruel than they. Besides, he is not ignorant that most of these
   hungry dogs, feeding on the same rewards, would rush into any
   contentions he wishes. I do not, however, say that they are mistaken
   who declare that he does not desire a council. But when he has arranged
   his own theater, some sudden storm will be raised with no great
   trouble, which will disturb the whole proceeding. Hence, at the very
   beginning, if his own advantage so require it, he will fold up the
   curtains. A council, however, though an empty phantom, he thinks to be
   to him like Hercules's club, to lay Christ prostrate, and to break in
   pieces the remnant of the Church.

   When this prince of impiety so wickedly tramples upon the glory of our
   God and the salvation of men, does it become us by silence to betray
   the sacred cause? nay, we ought to undergo hundred deaths, were that
   possible, rather than to suffer so unworthy, wicked, and barbarous
   oppression of sound doctrine to continue unknown through our sloth.

   But let us grant what is hardly credible, that the Pope with his band
   does seriously intend to call a council. In that case Christ will not,
   at the first view, be so grossly mocked; yet in this way a wicked
   conspiracy would be formed against him: nay, the greater the fame of
   the gravity and splendor of the Papal council, the more injurious would
   it be to the Church, and a more dreadful pest would it prove. For it
   cannot possibly be hoped, that an assembly gathered under the authority
   of Antichrist, should be governed by the Spirit, or that the slaves of
   Satan should exercise any moderation. In the first place, the Pope, the
   professed and sworn enemy of Christ, would occupy there the chief place
   of authority. Though he would especially pretend to ask the opinions of
   the Fathers sitting there, yet being terrified by his presence, they
   would all follow what would please him. But in an assembly fully
   agreeing in every impiety, what need would there be of dissimulation?
   Such, I have no doubt, is every one of the cardinals. In that very
   college, which pretends to be a holier senate, there prevails, it is
   evident, an Epicurean contempt of God, a savage hatred of truth, a
   rabid fury against all the pious. Then the order of bishops, does it
   not consist nearly of the same monsters? except that many among them
   are slothful asses, who neither openly despise God, nor hostilely
   oppose sound doctrine; yet they are so enamoured with their own
   depraved state, that they cannot endure any reformation. Add to this,
   that authority will reside almost wholly with the few, who, being
   indeed altogether destitute of any concern for true religion, will shew
   themselves the most fierce supporters of the Roman See: others will
   make up the number. As every one of these will speak the most atrocious
   things against us, there will be many not only of those who may only
   give their votes, but also of the princes, who will subscribe either
   willingly and gladly according to their own inclinations, or from
   ambition, or from fear.

   I am not however, so unjust as not to concede that some of these have a
   sounder judgment and are not otherwise ill disposed; but they do not
   possess so much courage, that they will dare to resist the wickedness
   of the whole body. There will be perhaps, amidst a thousand, two or
   three who may dare to give a half-uttered word for Christ, (as Peter
   Paul Vergerius at Trent) but the holy council of the Fathers will have
   a remedy at hand, so that such may not create any further trouble; for
   being cast into prison, they will be presently driven to a recantation,
   or they will have to pay the penalty of death for too much freedom of
   speech, or they will have to drink the cup of perpetual silence.

   But such is the equity with which we are treated, that we are
   untameable and hopelessly perverse heretics, except we seek from the
   holy council the rule for the necessary reformation, except we
   acquiesce without any demur in its decrees, whatever they may be. We,
   indeed, do not shun the authority of a legitimate council, (if such
   could be had,) as we have already made sufficiently evident by clear
   proofs. But when they require that we are to bow to the judgment of the
   chief adversary of Christ without any appeal, and indeed on this
   condition, that religion is to be defined at their will and pleasure,
   and not by the Word of God, what reason have we for submission, except
   we are prepared willingly and knowingly to deny Christ? There is no
   reason for any one to object and say, that we distrust before the time.
   Let them give us a council in which there will be a free liberty given
   to defend the cause of truth: if to that we refuse to come, and to give
   a reason for all that we have done, then they will justly charge us
   with contumacy. But so far will a permission be given us freely to
   speak, that there is no doubt but that we shall be prevented from
   making even a suitable defense. For how can they listen to the
   clear-sounding thunders of truth, who can by no means bear warnings
   however bland and conveyed in soft whispers? But this they publicly do
   -- They invite us; is it that they may grant us some place on the
   lowest seats? Nay, they declare that it is not lawful to admit any one
   to their sittings except the anointed and the mitred. Then let them
   sit, provided we are heard, declaring the truth while standing. They
   answer, that they freely promise a hearing; that is, that having
   presented a suppliant petition, being ordered immediately to depart,
   after the turbulent clamours of some days, we shall be recalled for the
   purpose of being condemned. I say clamours, not that any altercation of
   dissidents is to be in that assembly, but that the sacred ears of
   bishops having been so irreverently offended by us, the indignity will
   appear to them intolerable. It is not unknown how tumultuous is their
   violence. Surely, when they ought to determine the cause with reason,
   this can never be obtained from them, when not even a slight hearing
   can be hoped for.

   We shall endeavor to restore God's worship to its purity, purged from
   the innumerable superstitions by which it has been corrupted. Here the
   profane orators will chatter about nothing but the institutes, the old
   rites and ceremonies of the Fathers, as though the Church taught by the
   celestial ministry of the prophets and of Christ knew no other way of
   worshipping God than by adopting, in brutal stupidity, the dregs of
   Romulus, made fascinating by the anile dotages of Numa Pompilius. But
   where is that simplicity of obedience which the Lord everywhere makes
   so much of and so distinctly requires?

   If the controversy be concerning the depravity of human nature, the
   miserable and lost state of mankind, the grace and power of Christ, or
   the freeness of our salvation, they will immediately bring forward and
   dogmatically allege the putrid axioms of the schools, as things that
   ought to be received without dispute. The Holy Spirit teaches us in
   Scripture, that our mind is smitten with so much blindness, that the
   affections of our heart are so depraved and perverted, that our whole
   nature is so vitiated, that we can do nothing but sin, until he forms a
   new will within us. He constrains us, condemned to eternal death, to
   renounce all confidence in our own works, and to flee to our only
   asylum, the mercy of God, and to trust in it for all our righteousness.
   He also, inviting us to God, testifies that God is reconciled to us
   only through the blood of Christ, and bids us to rely on Christ's
   merits, and to come boldly to the heavenly tribunal. That none of these
   things may be heard, those endless decrees are adduced, to violate
   which is deemed more unlawful than to disbelieve God and all his
   angels.

   Of the sacraments they will not permit a word to be said, differing
   from the notions entertained of them. And what else is this but to
   preclude the possibility of any reformation? But it is easy to show how
   preposterous is the administration of the sacraments under the Papacy,
   so that hardly anything bears an affinity to the genuine doctrine of
   Christ. What spurious corruptions have crept in, nay, what disgraceful
   sacrileges have entered! It is not lawful to move a question on this
   subject. Hence it is a common saying with theologians, which they have
   published everywhere in their books: That the Church may remain safe,
   care must especially be taken that the council should not admit a doubt
   respecting the chief controversies of the present day. Come forth also
   has lately, in the Italian language, the insipid book of one Mutius,
   witlessly breathing nothing but carnage, in which he dwells profusely
   on this point, that nothing else is to be done by the reverend Fathers,
   when they meet in council, but to pronounce what already appears to
   them right on the whole subject, and to compel us to subscribe to their
   sanguinary edicts. I should not indeed have thought it necessary to
   mention the hoarse chatterings of this unlucky owl, had not Pope Julius
   recommended the work. Hence readers may judge what sort of council
   Mutius recommends, and is to be expected from Julius his approver.

   As then we see that these antichrists rush on with desperate
   pertinacity in order to destroy sound doctrine, and with equal
   insolence boldly exult that they will set up a masked council for no
   other purpose than that, having put to flight the gospel, they may
   celebrate their own victory; let us also in our turn gather courage to
   follow the banner of our leader, having put on the armor of truth. Were
   only the pure and simple doctrine of Scripture to shine forth as it
   ought, every one, who refuses not to open his eyes, would acknowledge
   the Papacy to be a savage and an execrable monster, made up, through
   Satan's arts, of innumerable masses of errors. For we make it evident
   by the most solid proofs, that the glory of God is so distributed by a
   sacrilegious rending among fictitious idols, that hardly a hundredth
   portion of his right remains to him. And further, when they reserve for
   him some portion of worship, we can show that no part of it is sincere,
   inasmuch as all things are full of the superstitious inventions of men;
   the law of God is also loaded with similar devices, for miserable
   consciences are held bound under the yoke of men, rather than ruled by
   God's commandments; and they groan and toil under the unjust burden of
   so many traditions, nay, they are oppressed with a cruel tyranny. We
   declare that, prevaricating obedience can avail nothing except to lead
   men to a deeper labyrinth. We shew clearly from Scripture, that
   Christ's power under the Papacy is almost abolished, that his grace is
   in a great measure made void, that unhappy souls removed from him, are
   inflated with a fatal confidence in their own power and works. We prove
   that prayer to God, such as is prescribed by his word, (which yet is
   the only true asylum of salvation) is wholly subverted. We plainly shew
   that the sacraments are adulterated by extraneous inventions, and are
   also transferred to a foreign purpose; for the power of the Spirit is
   impiously tied to them, and what is peculiar to Christ is ascribed to
   them. Then we disown the number seven, which they have presumptuously
   adopted. The mass also, which they imagine to be a sacrifice, we prove
   to be a disgraceful denial of the sacrifice of Christ. There are many
   other sacrilegious things of which we make it evident that they are
   guilty.

   Doubtless, were only the Scripture allowed its own authority, there are
   none of these things respecting which our adversaries would not be
   constrained to be mute. And this is what they by no means dissemble,
   when they contend that owing to the ambiguous meaning of Scripture, we
   ought to stand solely on the judgment of the Church. Who, I pray, does
   not see, that by laying aside the word of God, the whole right of
   defining things is thus transferred to them? Though they may kiss the
   closed copies of the Scripture as a kind of worship, when yet they
   charge it with being obscure and ambiguous, they allow it no more
   authority than if no part of it existed in writing. Let them assume
   specious titles as they please, that they may not appear to allege
   anything besides the dictates of the Spirit, (as they are wont to
   boast,) yet it is a settled and fixed thing with them, that all reasons
   being laid aside, their will alone ought to be believed (autopistos.)

   Then, lest the faithful should be carried about by every wind of
   imposture, lest they should be exposed to the crafty cavils of the
   ungodly, being taught by the sure experiment of faith, let them know
   that nothing is more firm or certain than the teaching of Scripture,
   and on that support let them confidently recumb. And since we see that
   it is shamefully deformed by the false comments of the Sophists, and
   that at this day the hired rabble of the Pope are bent on this
   artifice, in order that by their smoke they may obscure the light, it
   behoves us to be more intent on the restoration of its brightness.

   I, indeed, have in an especial manner resolved to devote myself to this
   work, as long as I live, whenever time and opportunity shall be
   afforded me. In the first place, the Church to which I belong shall
   thus receive the fruit of this labor, so that it may hereafter continue
   the longer; for though a small portion of time remains to me from the
   duties of my office, yet that, how small soever it may be, I have
   determined to devote to this kind of writing.

   But to return to you, most, illustrious King, here you have a small
   pledge, my Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles, where many things
   have been deemed obscure and recondite, which I have endeavored so to
   explain, that an easy access to the true meaning might be open to a
   reader not altogether slothful. And as interpreters of Scripture,
   according to their opportunity, are to supply weapons to fight against
   Antichrist, so also you must bear in mind that it is a duty which
   belongs to your Majesty, to vindicate from unworthy calumnies the true
   and genuine interpretation of Scripture, so that pure religion may
   flourish. It was not without reason that God commanded by Moses, that
   as soon as a king was appointed over his people, he should take care to
   have a copy of the Law written out for himself. Why so, if he had, as a
   private individual, already exercised himself diligently in this work,
   but that he might know that kings have themselves need of this
   remarkable doctrine, and are especially enjoined to defend and maintain
   it; the Lord has assigned to his Law a sacred habitation in their
   palaces. Moreover, since the heroic greatness of your mind far
   surpasses the measure of your age, there is no reason why I should add
   more words to stimulate you.

   Farewell, most noble King. May the Lord protect your Majesty as he has
   already done, govern you and your counsellors with the spirit of wisdom
   and fortitude, and keep your whole kingdom in safety and peace.

   Geneva, Jan. 24, 1551.

   COMMENTARIES

   ON

   THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER
     __________________________________________________________________

   THE ARGUMENT

   The design of Peter in this Epistle is to exhort the faithful to a
   denial of the world and a contempt of it, so that being freed from
   carnal affections and all earthly hindrances, they might with their
   whole soul aspire after the celestial kingdom of Christ, that being
   elevated by hope, supported by patience, and fortified by courage and
   perseverance, they might overcome all kinds of temptations, and pursue
   this course and practice throughout life.

   Hence at the very beginning he proclaims in express words the grace of
   God made known to us in Christ; and at the same time he adds, that it
   is received by faith and possessed by hope, so that the godly might
   raise up their minds and hearts above the world. Hence he exhorts them
   to holiness, lest they should render void the price by which they were
   redeemed, and lest they should suffer the incorruptible seed of the
   Word, by which they had been regenerated into eternal life, to be
   destroyed or to die. And as he had said, that they had been born again
   by God's Word, he makes mention of their spiritual infancy. Moreover,
   that their faith might not vacillate or stagger, because they saw that
   Christ was despised and rejected almost by the whole world, he reminds
   them that this was only the fulfillment of what had been written of
   him, that he would be the stone of stumbling. But he further teaches
   them that he would be a firm foundation to those who believe in him.
   Hence he again refers to the great honor to which God had raised them,
   that they might be animated by the contemplation of their former state,
   and by the perception of their present benefits, to devote themselves
   to a godly life.

   He afterwards comes to particular exhortations, -- that they were to
   conduct themselves in humility and obedience under the government of
   princes, that servants were to be subject to their masters, that wives
   were to obey their husbands and to be modest and chaste, and that, on
   the other hand, husbands were to treat their wives with kindness. And
   then he commands them to observe what was just and right towards one
   another; and that they might do this the more willingly, he sets before
   them what would be the fruit -- a peaceable and happy life.

   As, however, it happened to Christians, that how much soever they
   sought peace, they were often harassed by many injuries, and had the
   world for no just cause inimical to them, he exhorts them calmly to
   bear their persecutions, which they knew would promote their salvation.
   For this purpose he brings forward the example of Christ. On the other
   hand, he reminds them what unhappy end awaits the ungodly, whilst in
   the meantime God wonderfully delivers his Church from death by death.
   He still further refers to the example of Christ to enforce the
   mortification of the flesh. To this exhortation he adds various and
   brief sentences; but shortly after he returns to the doctrine of
   patience, so that the faithful might mingle consolation with their
   evils, regarding it as good for them to be chastised by the paternal
   hand of God.

   At the beginning of the fifth chapter he reminds the elders of their
   duty, that they were not to tyrannize over the Church, but to preside
   under Christ with moderation. He recommends to the young modesty and
   teachableness. At length, after a short exhortation, he closes the
   Epistle with a prayer.

   As to the place from which he wrote, all do not agree. There is,
   however, no reason that I see why we should doubt that he was then at
   Babylon, as he expressly declares. [3] But as the persuasion had
   prevailed, that he had moved from Antioch to Rome, and that he died at
   Rome, the ancients, led by this sole argument, imagined that Rome is
   here allegorically called Babylon. But as without any probable
   conjecture they rashly believed what they have said of the Roman
   episcopate of Peter, so also this allegorical figment ought to be
   regarded as nothing. It is indeed much more probable that Peter,
   according to the character of his apostleship, traveled over those
   parts in which most of the Jews resided; and we know that a great
   number of them were in Babylon and in the surrounding countries.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] Horne, in his Introduction, vol. 4, p. 425, mentions four opinions
   on this subject. According to Bishop Pearson, Mill, and Le Clerc, it
   was Babylon in Egypt; according to Erasmus, Drusius, Beza, Dr.
   Lightfoot, Basnage, Beausobre, Dr. Cave, Wetstein, Drs. Benson and A.
   Clarke, it was Babylon in Assyria; according to Michaelis, it was
   Babylon in Mesopotamia; and according to Grotius, Drs. Whitby, Lardner,
   Macknight, and Hales, Bishop Tomline, and all the learned of the Romish
   communion, it is to be taken figuratively for Rome, according to what
   was done by John in Revelation 17 and 18.What renders the last opinion
   very improbable is, that to date an epistle at a place to which a
   figurative name is given, is without another instance in Scripture, and
   the thing itself seems quite absurd. The language of prophecy is quite
   a different matter. Paul wrote several of his epistles at Rome, and in
   no instance did he do anything of this kind. Such an opinion would have
   never gained ground, had there not been from early times a foolish
   attempt to connect Peter with Rome. And it is to be regretted that some
   learned Protestants have been duped on this subject by a mass of
   fictitious evidence which has been collected by the partisans of the
   Romish Church. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Peter 1:1-2

   1. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
   throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

   1. Petrus, apostolus Jesu Christi, electis inquilinis qui dispersi sunt
   per Ponturn, Galatiam, Cappadociam, Asiam et Bithyniam,

   2. Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
   sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the
   blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.

   2. Secundum precognitionem Dei Patris in sanctificatione Spiritus, in
   obedientiam et aspersionem sanguinis Jesu Christi; Gratia vobis et pax
   multiplicetur.


   1 Peter, an apostle What in this salutation is the same with those of
   Paul, requires no new explanation. When Paul prayed for grace and
   peace, the verb is left out; but Peter adds it, and says, be
   multiplied; still the meaning is the same; for Paul did not wish to the
   faithful the beginning of grace and peace, but the increase of them,
   that is, that God would complete what he had begun.

   To the elect, or the elected. It may be asked, how could this be found
   out, for the election of God is hid, and cannot be known without the
   special revelation of the Spirit; and as every one is made sure of his
   own election by the testimony of the Spirit, so he can know nothing
   certain of others. To this I answer, that we are not curiously to
   inquire about the election of our brethren, but ought on the contrary
   to regard their calling, so that all who are admitted by faith into the
   church, are to be counted as the elect; for God thus separates them
   from the world, which is a sign of election. It is no objection to say
   that many fall away, having nothing but the semblance; for it is the
   judgment of charity and not of faith, when we deem all those elect in
   whom appears the mark of God's adoption. And that he does not fetch
   their election from the hidden counsel of God, but gathers it from the
   effect, is evident from the context; for afterwards he connects it with
   the sanctification of the Spirit As far then as they proved that they
   were regenerated by the Spirit of God, so far did he deem them to be
   the elect of God, for God does not sanctify any but those whom he has
   previously elected.

   However, he at the same time reminds us whence that election flows, by
   which we are separated for salvation, that we may not perish with the
   world; for he says, according to the foreknowledge of God This is the
   fountain and the first cause: God knew before the world was created
   whom he had elected for salvation.

   But we ought wisely to consider what this precognition or foreknowledge
   is. For the sophists, in order to obscure the grace of God, imagine
   that the merits of each are foreseen by God, and that thus the
   reprobate are distinguished from the elect, as every one proves himself
   worthy of this or that lot. But Scripture everywhere sets the counsel
   of God, on which is founded our salvation, in opposition to our merits.
   Hence, when Peter calls them elect according to the precognition of
   God, he intimates that the cause of it depends on nothing else but on
   God alone, for he of his own free will has chosen us. Then the
   foreknowledge of God excludes every worthiness on the part of man. We
   have treated this subject more at large in [2]the first chapter of the
   Epistle to the Ephesians, and in other places.

   As however in our election he assigns the first place to the gratuitous
   favor of God, so again he would have us to know it by the effects, for
   there is nothing more dangerous or more preposterous than to overlook
   our calling and to seek for the certainty of our election in the hidden
   prescience of God, which is the deepest labyrinth. Therefore to obviate
   this danger, Peter supplies the best correction; for though in the
   first place he would have us to consider the counsel of God, the cause
   of which is alone in himself; yet he invites us to notice the effect,
   by which he sets forth and bears witness to our election. That effect
   is the sanctification of the Spirit, even effectual calling, when faith
   is added to the outward preaching of the gospel, which faith is
   begotten by the inward operation of the Spirit.

   To the sojourners [4] They who think that all the godly are thus
   called, because they are strangers in the world, and are advancing
   towards the celestial country, are much mistaken, and this mistake is
   evident from the word dispersion which immediately follows; for this
   can apply only to the Jews, not only because they were banished from
   their own country and scattered here and there, but also because they
   had been driven out of that land which had been promised to them by the
   Lord as a perpetual inheritance. He indeed afterwards calls all the
   faithful sojourners, because they are pilgrims on the earth; but the
   reason here is different. They were sojourners, because they had been
   dispersed, some in Pontus, some in Galatia, and some in Bithynia. It is
   nothing strange that he designed this Epistle more especially for the
   Jews, for he knew that he was appointed in a particular manner their
   apostle, as Paul teaches us in Galatians 2:8. In the countries he
   enumerates, he includes the whole of Asia Minor, from the Euxine to
   Cappadocia. [5]

   Unto obedience He adds two things to sanctification, and seems to
   understand newness of life by obedience, and by the sprinkling of the
   blood of Christ the remission of sins. But if these be parts or effects
   of sanctification, then sanctification is to be taken here somewhat
   different from what it means when used by Paul, that is, more
   generally. God then sanctifies us by an effectual calling; and this is
   done when we are renewed to an obedience to his righteousness, and when
   we are sprinkled by the blood of Christ, and thus are cleansed from our
   sins. And there seems to be an implied allusion to the ancient rite of
   sprinkling used under the law. For as it was not then sufficient for
   the victim to be slain and the blood to be poured out, except the
   people were sprinkled; so now the blood of Christ which has been shed
   will avail us nothing, except our consciences are by it cleansed. There
   is then to be understood here a contrast, that, as formerly under the
   law the sprinkling of blood was made by the hand of the priest; so now
   the Holy Spirit sprinkles our souls with the blood of Christ for the
   expiation of our sins.

   Let us now state the substance of the whole; which is, that our
   salvation flows from the gratuitous election of God; but that it is to
   be ascertained by the experience of faith, because he sanctifies us by
   his Spirit; and then that there are two effects or ends of our calling,
   even renewal into obedience and ablution by the blood of Christ; and
   further, that both are the work of the Holy Spirit. [6] We hence
   conclude, that election is not to be separated from calling, nor the
   gratuitous righteousness of faith from newness of life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4] Inquilinis; they are those who dwell in a hired house, tenants. The
   original, parepidemois, means those who dwell among a people, that is,
   not their own. Sojourners or pilgrims would be the best word. The
   sentence literally is, "To the sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus."
   etc. -- Ed.

   [5] On this question both ancient and modern divines have differed. It
   is to be decided by the contents of the Epistle only. There is nothing
   decisive in favor of the opinion that it was written only to believing
   Jews; but there is a passage, 1 Peter 4:3, which seems clearly to shew
   that Peter included the believing Gentiles; for "the abominable
   idolatries" could only refer to them, as the Jews, since the Babylonian
   captivity, had never fallen into idolatry. -- Ed.

   [6] The meaning would be more clear, were we to make a change in the
   order of the words, "Elected, according to the foreknowledge of God,
   unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, through
   (or, by) the sanctification of the Spirit," that is, they were elected
   in order that they might obey the gospel, and be cleansed from the
   guilt of sin by the blood of Christ, through the sanctifying power of
   the Spirit. It was not their obedience that made them the elect, but
   they were chosen that they might obey, and thus obey through the
   influence of the Spirit. This is clearly the doctrine of this passage.
   See 2 Thessalonians 2:13 -- Ed.

   1 Peter 1:3-5

   3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
   according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively
   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

   3. Benedictus Deus et Pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, qui secundum
   multam suam misericordiam regenuit nos in spem vivare, per
   resurrectionem Jesu Christi ex mortuis,

   4. To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not
   away, reserved in heaven for you,

   4. In haereditatem incorruptibilem et incontaminatam et
   immarcescibilem, repositum in caelis erga vos,

   5. Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready
   to be revealed in the last time.

   5. Qui virtute Dei custodimini per fidem in salutem, qut parata est
   revelari tempore ultimo.


   3 Blessed be God We have said that the main object of this epistle is
   to raise us above the world, in order that we may be prepared and
   encouraged to sustain the spiritual contests of our warfare. For this
   end, the knowledge of God's benefits avails much; for, when their value
   appears to us, all other things will be deemed worthless, especially
   when we consider what Christ and his blessings are; for everything
   without him is but dross. For this reason he highly extols the
   wonderful grace of God in Christ, that is, that we may not deem it much
   to give up the world in order that we may enjoy the invaluable treasure
   of a future life; and also that we may not be broken down by present
   troubles, but patiently endure them, being satisfied with eternal
   happiness.

   Further, when he gives thanks to God, he invites the faithful to
   spiritual joy, which can swallow up all the opposite feelings of the
   flesh.

   And Father of our Lord Jesus Christ Understand the words thus, --
   "Blessed be God who is the Father of Jesus Christ." For, as formerly,
   by calling himself the God of Abraham, he designed to mark the
   difference between him and all fictitious gods; so after he has
   manifested himself in his own Son, his will is, not to be known
   otherwise than in him. Hence they who form their ideas of God in his
   naked majesty apart from Christ, have an idol instead of the true God,
   as the case is with the Jews and the Turks. Whosoever, then, seeks
   really to know the only true God, must regard him as the Father of
   Christ; for, whenever our mind seeks God, except Christ be thought of,
   it will wander and be confused, until it be wholly lost. Peter meant at
   the same time to intimate how God is so bountiful and kind towards us;
   for, except Christ stood as the middle person, his goodness could never
   be really known by us.

   Who hath begotten us again He shews that supernatural life is a gift,
   because we are born the children of wrath; for had we been born to the
   hope of life according to the flesh, there would have been no necessity
   of being begotten again by God. Therefore Peter teaches us, that we who
   are by nature destined to eternal death, are restored to life by God's
   mercy. And this is, as it were, our second creation, as it is said in
   the first chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians. Lively or living
   hope, means the hope of life. [7] At the same time there seems to be an
   implied contrast between the hope fixed on the incorruptible kingdom of
   God, and the fading and transient hopes of man.

   According to his abundant mercy He first mentions the efficient cause,
   and then he points out the mediating cause, as they say. He shews that
   God was induced by no merits of ours to regenerate us unto a living
   hope, because he assigns this wholly to his mercy. But that he might
   more completely reduce the merits of works to nothing, he says, great
   (multam) mercy. All, indeed, confess that God is the only author of our
   salvation, but they afterwards invent extraneous causes, which take
   away so much from his mercy. But Peter commends mercy alone; and he
   immediately connects the way or manner, by the resurrection of Christ;
   for God does not in any other way discover his mercy; hence Scripture
   ever directs our attention to this point. And that Christ's death is
   not mentioned, but his resurrection, involves no inconsistency, for it
   is included; because a thing cannot be completed without having a
   beginning; and he especially brought forward the resurrection, because
   he was speaking of a new life.

   4 To an inheritance [8] The three words which follow are intended to
   amplify God's grace; for Peter (as I have before said) had this object
   in view, to impress our minds thoroughly as to its excellency.
   Moreover, these two clauses, "to an inheritance incorruptible," etc.,
   and "to salvation ready to be revealed," I deem as being in apposition,
   the latter being explanatory of the former; for he expresses the same
   thing in two ways.

   Every word which follows is weighty. The inheritance is said to be
   reserved, or preserved, that we may know that it is beyond the reach of
   danger. For, were it not in God's hand, it might be exposed to endless
   dangers. If it were in this world, how could we regard it as safe
   amidst so many changes? That he might then free us from every fear, he
   testifies that our salvation is placed in safety beyond the harms which
   Satan can do. But as the certainty of salvation can bring us but little
   comfort, except each one knows that it belongs to himself, Peter adds,
   for you For consciences will calmly recumb here, that is, when the Lord
   cries to them from heaven, "Behold, your salvation is in my hand and is
   kept for you." But as salvation is not indiscriminately for all, he
   calls our attention to faith, that all who are endued with faith, might
   be distinguished from the rest, and that they might not doubt but that
   they are the true and legitimate heirs of God. For, as faith penetrates
   into the heavens, so also it appropriates to us the blessings which are
   in heaven.

   5 Who are kept by the power of God We are to notice the connection when
   he says, that we are kept while in the world, and at the same time our
   inheritance is reserved in heaven; otherwise this thought would
   immediately creep in, "What does it avail us that our salvation is laid
   up in heaven, when we are tossed here and there in this world as in a
   turbulent sea? What can it avail us that our salvation is secured in a
   quiet harbour, when we are driven to and fro amidst thousand
   shipwrecks?" The apostle, therefore, anticipates objections of this
   kind, when he shews, that though we are in the world exposed to
   dangers, we are yet kept by faith; and that though we are thus nigh to
   death, we are yet safe under the guardianship of faith. But as faith
   itself, through the infirmity of the flesh, often quails, we might be
   always anxious about the morrow, were not the Lord to aid us. [9]

   And, indeed, we see that under the Papacy a diabolical opinion
   prevails, that we ought to doubt our final perseverance, because we are
   uncertain whether we shall be tomorrow in the same state of grace. But
   Peter did not thus leave us in suspense; for he testifies that we stand
   by the power of God, lest any doubt arising from a consciousness of our
   own infirmity, should disquiet us. How weak soever we may then be, yet
   our salvation is not uncertain, because it is sustained by God's power.
   As, then, we are begotten by faith, so faith itself receives its
   stability from God's power. Hence is its security, not only for the
   present, but also for the future.

   Unto salvation As we are by nature impatient of delay, and soon succumb
   under weariness, he therefore reminds us that salvation is not deferred
   because it is not yet prepared, but because the time of its revelation
   is not yet come. This doctrine is intended to nourish and sustain our
   hope. Moreover, he calls the day of judgment the last time, because the
   restitution of all things is not to be previously expected, for the
   intervening time is still in progress. What is elsewhere called the
   last time, is the whole from the coming of Christ; it is so called from
   a comparison with the preceding ages. But Peter had a regard to the end
   of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [7] "This is a Hebraism," says Macknight, "for a hope of life.
   Accordingly, the Syriac version hath here, in spem vitae -- to a hope
   of life." The begetting again seems not to refer to inward renovation,
   but to what God did by raising Christ from the dead. To beget,
   sometimes means to put one in a new state or condition; as the
   expression, "This day have I begotten thee," means, that God had then
   constituted his Son a king, publicly invested him, as it were, with
   that office. Similar is the meaning here: God through the resurrection
   of Christ restored to the hope of life his desponding followers: hence
   the import of the word "again;" though Macknight thinks the reference
   to be to the covenant of grace made with our first parents after the
   fall, and that believers were begotten the second time to the same hope
   by the resurrection of Christ. The word for "begetting again," is only
   found here, and in a passive sense in the 23d verse, where it has a
   different meaning, as it evidently refers to the renovation of the
   heart. -- Ed.

   [8] Pareus puts, "that is, to an inheritance," making this sentence
   explanatory of "the hope," as hope here is a metonymy for its object.
   It is an inheritance "incorruptible," not to be destroyed by a flood or
   by fire, -- "undefiled," not like the land of Canaan, its type, which
   was defiled by its inhabitants, -- "unfading," different from any
   worldly inheritance, for the world passeth away. -- Ed.

   [9] The meaning would be somewhat different, but the sentence would be
   more intelligible, were we to render it thus, "Who are kept by faith in
   the power of God unto salvation." Salvation here means that of the body
   as well as of the soul at the resurrection. -- Ed.

   1 Peter 1:6-9

   6. Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye
   are in heaviness through manifold temptations:

   6. In quo exultatis, paulisper nunc, si opus esti, contristati in
   variis tentationibus;

   7. That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold
   that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto
   praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:

   7. Ut probatio fidel vestrae multo pretiosior auro, quod perit et tamen
   per ignem probatur, reperiatur in laudem et honorem et gloriam, quum
   revelabitur Jesus Christus:

   8. Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not,
   yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:

   8. Quem quum non videritis, diligitis, in quem nunc credentes, quum eum
   non aspicitis, exultatis gaudio inenarrabili et glorificato;

   9. Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.

   9. Reportantes finem fidei vestrae, salutem animarum.


   6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, or, In which ye exult. Though the
   termination of the Greek verb is doubtful, yet the meaning requires
   that we read, "ye exult," rather than "exult ye." In which refers to
   the whole that is said of the hope of salvation laid up in heaven. But
   he rather exhorts than praises them; for his object was to shew what
   fruit was to come from the hope of salvation, even spiritual joy, by
   which not only the bitterness of all evil might be mitigated, but also
   all sorrow overcome. At the same time to exult is more expressive than
   to rejoice. [10]

   But it seems somewhat inconsistent, when he says that the faithful, who
   exulted with joy, were at the same time sorrowful, for these are
   contrary feelings. But the faithful know by experience, how these
   things can exist together, much better than can be expressed in words.
   However, to explain the matter in a few words, we may say that the
   faithful are not logs of wood, nor have they so divested themselves of
   human feelings, but that they are affected with sorrow, fear danger,
   and feel poverty as an evil, and persecutions as hard and difficult to
   be borne. Hence they experience sorrow from evils; but it is so
   mitigated by faith, that they cease not at the same time to rejoice.
   Thus sorrow does not prevent their joy, but, on the contrary, give
   place to it. Again, though joy overcomes sorrow, yet it does not put an
   end to it, for it does not divest us of humanity. And hence it appears
   what true patience is; its beginning, and, as it were, its root, is the
   knowledge of God's blessings, especially of that gratuitous adoption
   with which he has favored us; for all who raise hither their minds,
   find it an easy thing calmly to bear all evils. For whence is it that
   our minds are pressed down with grief, except that we have no
   participation of spiritual things? But all they who regard their
   troubles as necessary trials for their salvation, not only rise above
   them, but also turn them to an occasion of joy.

   Ye are in heaviness, or, Ye are made sorrowful. Is not sorrow also the
   common lot of the reprobate? for they are not free from evils. But
   Peter meant that the faithful endure sorrow willingly, while the
   ungodly murmur and perversely contend with God. Hence the godly bear
   sorrow, as the tamed ox the yoke, or as a horse, broken in, the bridle,
   though held by a child. God by sorrow afflicts the reprobate, as when a
   bridle is by force put in the mouth of a ferocious and refractory
   horse; he kicks and offers every resistance, but all in vain. Then
   Peter commends the faithful, because they willingly undergo sorrow, and
   not as though forced by necessity.

   By saying, though now for a season, or, a little while, he supplied
   consolation; for the shortness of time, however hard evils may be, does
   not a little lessen them; and the duration of the present life is but a
   moment of time. If need be; the condition is to be taken for a cause;
   for he purposed to shew, that God does not, without reason, thus try
   his people; for, if God afflicted us without a cause, to bear it would
   be grievous. Hence Peter took an argument for consolation from the
   design of God; not that the reason always appears to us, but that we
   ought to be fully persuaded that it ought to be so, because it is God's
   will.

   We must notice that he does not mention one temptation, but many; and
   not temptations of one kind, but manifold temptations It is, however,
   better to seek the exposition of this passage in [3]the first chapter
   of James

   7. Much more precious than of gold The argument is from the less to the
   greater; for if gold, a corruptible metal, is deemed of so much value
   that we prove it by fire, that it may become really valuable, what
   wonder is it that God should require a similar trial as to faith, since
   faith is deemed by him so excellent? And though the words seem to have
   a different meaning, he yet compares faith to gold, and makes it more
   precious than gold, that hence he might draw the conclusion, that it
   ought to be fully proved. [11] It is moreover uncertain how far he
   extends the meaning of the words, "tried" dokimazesthai and "trial"
   dokimion

   Gold is, indeed, tried twice by fire; first, when it is separated from
   its dross; and then, when a judgment is to be formed of its purity.
   Both modes of trial may very suitably be applied to faith; for when
   there is much of the dregs of unbelief remaining in us, and when by
   various afflictions we are refined as it were in God's furnace, the
   dross of our faith is removed, so that it becomes pure and clean before
   God; and, at the same time, a trial of it is made, as to whether it be
   true or fictitious. I am disposed to take these two views, and what
   immediately follows seems to favor this explanation; for as silver is
   without honor or value before it be refined, so he intimates that our
   faith is not to be honored and crowned by God until it be duly proved.

   At the appearing of Jesus Christ, or, when Jesus Christ shall be
   revealed. This is added, that the faithful might learn to hold on
   courageously to the last day. For our life is now hidden in Christ, and
   will remain hidden, and as it were buried, until Christ shall appear
   from heaven; and the whole course of our life leads to the destruction
   of the external man, and all the things we suffer are, as it were, the
   preludes of death. It is hence necessary, that we should cast our own
   eyes on Christ, if we wish in our afflictions to behold glory and
   praise. For trials as to us are full of reproach and shame, and they
   become glorious in Christ; but that glory in Christ is not yet plainly
   seen, for the day of consolation is not yet come. [12]

   8 Whom having not seen, or, Whom though ye have not seen. He lays down
   two things, that they loved Christ whom they had not seen, and that
   they believed on him whom they did not then behold. But the first
   arises from the second; for the cause of love is faith, not only
   because the knowledge of those blessings which Christ bestows on us,
   moves us to love him, but because he offers us perfect felicity, and
   thus draws us up to himself. He then commends the Jews, because they
   believed in Christ whom they did not see, that they might know that the
   nature of faith is to acquiesce in those blessings which are hid from
   our eyes. They had indeed given some proof of this very thing, though
   he rather directs what was to be done by praising them.

   The first clause in order is, that faith is not to be measured by
   sight. For when the life of Christians is apparently miserable, they
   would instantly fail, were not their happiness dependent on hope.
   Faith, indeed, has also its eyes, but they are such as penetrate into
   the invisible kingdom of God, and are contented with the mirror of the
   Word; for it is the demonstration of invisible things, as it is said in
   Hebrews 11:1. Hence true is that saying of Paul, that

   we are absent from the Lord while we are in the flesh;
   for we walk by faith and not by sight.
   (2 Corinthians 5:6-7.)

   The second clause is, that faith is not a cold notion, but that it
   kindles in our hearts love to Christ. For faith does not (as the
   sophists prattle) lay hold on God in a confused and implicit manner,
   (for this would be to wander through devious paths;) but it has Christ
   as its object. Moreover, it does not lay hold on the bare name of
   Christ, or his naked essence, but regards what he is to us, and what
   blessings he brings; for it cannot be but that the affections of man
   should be led there, where his happiness is, according to that saying,

   "Where your treasure is, there is also your heart." (Matthew 6:21.)

   Ye rejoice, or, Ye exult. He again refers to the fruit of faith which
   he had mentioned, and not without reason; for it is an incomparable
   benefit, that consciences are not only at peace before God, but
   confidently exult in the hope of eternal life. And he calls it joy
   unspeakable, or unutterable, because the peace of God exceeds all
   comprehension. What is added, full of glory, or glorified, admits of
   two explanations. It means either what is magnificent and glorious, or
   what is contrary to that which is empty and fading, of which men will
   soon be ashamed. Thus "glorified" is the same with what is solid and
   permanent, beyond the danger of being brought to nothing. [13] Those
   who are not elevated by this joy above the heavens, so that being
   content with Christ alone, they despise the world, in vain boast that
   they have faith.

   9 Receiving the end of your faith He reminds the faithful where they
   ought to direct all their thoughts, even to eternal salvation. For this
   world holds all our affections ensnared by is allurements; this life
   and all things belonging to the body are great impediments, which
   prevent us from applying our minds to the contemplation of the future
   and spiritual life. Hence the Apostle sets before us this future life
   as a subject of deep meditation, and he indirectly intimates that the
   loss of all other things is to be deemed as nothing, provided our souls
   be saved. By saying receiving, he takes away all doubt, in order that
   they might more cheerfully go on, being certain of obtaining salvation.
   [14] In the meantime, however, he shews what the end of faith is, lest
   they should be over-anxious, because it is as yet deferred. For our
   adoption ought now to satisfy us; nor ought we to ask to be introduced
   before the time into the possession of our inheritance. We may also
   take the end for reward; but the meaning would be the same. For we
   learn from the Apostle's words, that salvation is not otherwise
   obtained than by faith; and we know that faith leans on the sole
   promise of gratuitous adoption; but if it be so, doubtless salvation is
   not owing to the merits of works, nor can it be hoped for on their
   account.

   But why does he mention souls only, when the glory of a resurrection is
   promised to our bodies? As the soul is immortal, salvation is properly
   ascribed to it, as Paul sometimes is wont to speak, --

   "That the soul may be saved in the day of the Lord."
   (1 Corinthians 5:5.)

   But it is the same as though he had said "Eternal salvation." For there
   is an implied comparison between it and the mortal and fading life
   which belongs to the body. At the same time, the body is not excluded
   from a participation of glory when annexed to the soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [10] Some take the verb in a future sense, "At which (time) ye shall
   exult;" and some as being an imperative, "On account of which exult
   ye;" but neither of these comports with the context; for the 8th verse
   proves that he speaks of present joy, and that he states the case as it
   was among them. It is better with Calvin to refer "wherein," or, "on
   account of which," to the fact stated in the previous verse, that they
   were kept by God's power for salvation ready to be revealed. -- Ed.

   [11] The seeming difference in meaning referred to, arises from this,
   that the Apostle uses two nouns (a common thing in Scripture) instead
   of a noun and an adjective or participle -- "the trial of your faith,"
   instead of "your tried faith," or, "your faith when tried." -- Ed.

   [12] The "praise, honor, and glory," refer to tried faith; it will be
   praised or approved by the Judge, honored before men and angels, and
   followed by eternal glory. -- Ed.

   [13] After "unspeakable," "glorified" must mean something greater, or
   it may be viewed as more specific, it is a joy unspeakable, it being a
   glorified joy in a measure, or the joy of the glorified in heaven.
   According to this view the words may be thus rendered, "with joy
   unspeakable and heavenly." Doddridge gives this paraphrase, "With
   unutterable and even glorified joy, with such a joy as seems to
   anticipate that of the saints in glory." -- Ed.

   [14] It is necessary either to give a future meaning to this
   participle, "Being about to receive;" or to view the Apostle as
   speaking of the salvation of the soul now, as distinct from the
   salvation of the soul and body hereafter. The latter view seems most
   appropriate to the passage. The soul is now saved by faith. The end of
   faith, its object and accomplishment, is reconciliation with God, and
   reconciliation is salvation. -- Ed.

   1 Peter 1:10-12

   10. Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
   diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:

   10. De qua salute exquisierunt et scrutati sunt prophetee, qui de
   futura erga nos gratia vaticinati sunt;

   11. Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which
   was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of
   Christ, and the glory that should follow.

   11. Scrutantes in quem aut cujusmodi temporis articulum significaret
   qui in illis erat Spiritus Christi; prius testificans ventufas in
   Christum afflictiones, et quee sequuturae erant glorias;

   12. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us
   they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them
   that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down
   from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.

   12. Quibus revelatum est quod non sibi ipsis, sed nobis ministrabant
   haec, quae nunc annunciata sunt vobis per cos qui vobis praedicarunt
   evangelitum, per Spiritum sanctum missum e coelo; in quae desiderant
   angeli prospicere.


   He hence commends the value of salvation, because the prophets had
   their minds intensely fixed on it; for it must have been a great
   matter, and possessing peculiar excellency, which could have thus
   kindled in the prophets a spirit of inquiry respecting it. But still
   more clearly does God's goodness toward us shine forth in this case,
   because much more is now made known to us than what all the prophets
   attained by their long and anxious inquiries. At the same time he
   confirms the certainty of salvation by this very antiquity; for from
   the beginning of the world it had received a plain testimony from the
   Holy Spirit.

   These two things ought to be distinctly noticed: he declares that more
   has been given to us than to the ancient fathers, in order to amplify
   by this comparison the grace of the gospel; and then, that what is
   preached to us respecting salvation, cannot be suspected of any
   novelty, for the Spirit had formerly testified of it by the prophets.
   When, therefore, he says that the prophets searched and sedulously
   inquired, this does not belong to their writings or doctrine, but to
   the private desire with which every one boiled over. What is said
   afterwards is to be referred to their public office.

   But that each particular may be more evident, the passage must be
   arranged under certain propositions. Let the first then be this, --
   that the Prophets who foretold of the grace which Christ exhibited at
   his coming, diligently inquired as to the time when full revelation was
   to be made. The second is, -- that the Spirit of Christ predicted by
   them of the future condition of Christ's kingdom, such as it is now,
   and such as it is expected yet to be, even that it is destined that
   Christ and his whole body should, through various sufferings, enter
   into glory. The third is, -- that the prophets ministered to us more
   abundantly than to their own age, and that this was revealed to them
   from above; for in Christ only is the full exhibition of those things
   of which God then presented but an obscure image. The fourth is, --
   that in the Gospel is contained a clear confirmation of prophetic
   doctrine, but also a much fuller and plainer explanation; for the
   salvation which he formerly proclaimed as it were at a distance by the
   prophets, he now reveals openly to us, and as it were before our eyes.
   The last proposition is, -- that it hence appears evident how wonderful
   is the glory of that salvation promised to us in the Gospel, because
   even angels, though they enjoy God's presence in heaven, yet burn with
   the desire of seeing it. Now all these things tend to shew this one
   thing, that Christians, elevated to the height of their felicity, ought
   to surmount all the obstacles of the world; for what is there which
   this incomparable benefit does not reduce to nothing?

   10 Of which salvation Had not the fathers the same salvation as we
   have? Why then does he say that the fathers inquired, as though they
   possessed not what is now offered to us? The answer to this is plain,
   that salvation is to be taken here for that clear manifestation of it
   which we have through the coming of Christ. The words of Peter mean no
   other thing than those of Christ, when he said,

   "Many kings and prophets have desired to see the things which ye see,
   and have not seen them." (Matthew 13:17.)

   As then the prophets had but a limited knowledge of the grace brought
   by Christ, as to its revelation they justly desired something more.
   When Simeon, after seeing Christ, prepared himself calmly and with a
   satisfied mind for death, he shewed that he was before unsatisfied and
   anxious. Such was the feeling of all the godly.

   11. And what they inquired is pointed out when he adds, Searching what,
   or what manner of time There was a difference between the law and the
   gospel, a veil as it were being interposed, that they might not see
   those things nearer which are now set before our eyes. Nor was it
   indeed proper, while Christ the Sun of righteousness was yet absent,
   that the full light should shine as at mid-day. And though it was their
   duty to confine themselves within their prescribed limits, yet it was
   no superstition to sigh with a desire of having a nearer sight. For
   when they wished that redemption should be hastened, and desired daily
   to see it, there was nothing in such a wish to prevent them patiently
   to wait as long as it pleased the Lord to defer the time. Moreover, to
   seek as to prophecies the particular time, seems to me unprofitable;
   for what is spoken of here is not what the prophets taught, but what
   they wished. Where the Latin interpreters render, "of future grace," it
   is literally, "of the grace which is to you." But as the meaning
   remains the same, I was not disposed to make any change.

   It is more worthy of observation, that he does not say that the
   prophets searched according to their own understanding as to the time
   when Christ's kingdom would come, but that they applied their minds to
   the revelation of the Spirit. Thus they have taught us by their example
   a sobriety in learning, for they did not go beyond what the Spirit
   taught them. And doubtless there will be no limits to man's curiosity,
   except the Spirit of God presides over their minds, so that they may
   not desire anything else than to speak from him. And further, the
   spiritual kingdom is a higher subject than what the human mind can
   succeed in investigating, except the Spirit be the guide. May we also
   therefore submit to his guidance.

   The Spirit of Christ which was in them First, "who was in them," and
   secondly, "testifying," that is, giving a testimony, by which
   expression he intimates that the prophets were endued with the Spirit
   of knowledge, and indeed in no common manner, as those who have been
   teachers and witnesses to us, and that yet they were not partakers of
   that light which is exhibited to us. At the same time, a high praise is
   given to their doctrine, for it was the testimony of the Holy Spirit;
   the preachers and ministers were men, but he was the teacher. Nor does
   he declare without reason that the Spirit of Christ then ruled; and he
   makes the Spirit, sent from heaven, to preside over the teachers of the
   Gospel, for he shews that the Gospel comes from God, and that the
   ancient prophecies were dictated by Christ.

   The sufferings of Christ That they might bear submissively their
   afflictions, he reminds them that they had been long ago foretold by
   the Spirit. But he includes much more than this, for he teaches us,
   that the Church of Christ has been from the beginning so constituted,
   that the cross has been the way to victory, and death a passage to
   life, and that this had been clearly testified. There is, therefore, no
   reason why afflictions should above measure depress us, as though we
   were miserable under them, since the Spirit of God pronounces us
   blessed.

   The order is to be noticed; he mentions sufferings first, and then adds
   the glories which are to follow. For he intimates that this order
   cannot be changed or subverted; afflictions must precede glory. So
   there is to be understood a twofold truth in these words, -- that
   Christians must suffer many troubles before they enjoy glory, -- and
   that afflictions are not evils, because they have glory annexed to
   them. Since God has ordained this connection, it does not behove us to
   separate the one from the other. And it is no common consolation, that
   our condition, such as we find it to be, has been foretold so many ages
   ago.

   Hence we learn, that it is not in vain that a happy end is promised to
   us; secondly, we hence know that we are not afflicted by chance, but
   through the infallible providence of God; and lastly, that prophecies
   are like mirrors to set forth to us in tribulations the image of
   celestial glory.

   Peter, indeed, says, that the Spirit had testified of the coming
   afflictions of Christ; but he does not separate Christ from his body.
   This, then, is not to be confined to the person of Christ, but a
   beginning is to be made with the head, so that the members may in due
   order follow, as Paul also teaches us, that we must be conformed to him
   who is the first-born among his brethren. In short, Peter does not
   speak of what is peculiar to Christ, but of the universal state of the
   Church. But it is much fitted to confirm our faith, when he sets forth
   our afflictions as viewed in Christ, for we thereby see better the
   connection of death and life between us and him. And, doubtless, this
   is the privilege and manner of the holy union, that he suffers daily in
   his members, that after his sufferings shall be completed in us, glory
   also may have its completion. See more on this subject in [4]the third
   chapter of the Epistle to the Colossians, and in [5]the fourth of the
   first Epistle to Timothy.

   12 Unto whom it was revealed This passage has been strangely perverted
   by fanatics, so as to exclude the fathers who lived under the law from
   the hope of eternal salvation. For it does not deny that the prophets
   usefully ministered to their own age, and edified the church, but
   teaches us that their ministry is more useful to us, because we are
   fallen on the ends of the world. We see how highly they extolled the
   kingdom of Christ, how assiduous they were in adorning it, how
   diligently they stimulated all to seek it; but they were by death
   deprived of the privilege of seeing it as it now is. What else then was
   this, but that they spread the table, that others might afterwards feed
   on the provisions laid on it. They indeed tasted by faith of those
   things which the Lord has by their hands transmitted to be enjoyed by
   us; and they also partook of Christ as the real food of their souls.
   But what is spoken of now is the exhibition of this blessing, and we
   know that the prophetic office was confined as it were within limits,
   in order that they might support themselves and others with the hope of
   Christ, who was to come. They therefore possessed him as one hidden,
   and as it were absent -- absent, I say, not in power or grace, but
   because he was not yet manifested in the flesh. Therefore his kingdom
   also was as yet hid as it were under coverings. At length descending on
   earth, he in a manner opened heaven to us, so that we might have a near
   view of those spiritual riches, which before were under types exhibited
   at a distance. This fruition then of Christ as manifested, forms the
   difference between us and the prophets. Hence we learn how they
   ministered to us rather than to themselves.

   But though the prophets were admonished from above that the grace which
   they proclaimed would be deferred to another age, yet they were not
   slothful in proclaiming it, so far were they from being broken down
   with weariness. But if their patience was so great, surely we shall be
   twice and thrice ungrateful, if the fruition of the grace denied to
   them will not sustain us under all the evils which are to be endured.

   Which are now reported to you, or announced to you. He again marks the
   difference between the ancient doctrine and the preaching of the
   gospel. For as the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel,
   having a testimony from the law and the prophets, so also the glory of
   Christ, of which the Spirit testified formerly, is now openly
   proclaimed. And at the same time he hence proves the certainty of the
   gospel, because it contains nothing but what had been long ago
   testified by the Spirit of God. He further reminds them, that under the
   banner of the same Spirit, by his dictation and guidance, the gospel
   was preached, lest they might think of anything human in this case.

   Which things the angels desire to look into It is indeed the highest
   praise to the gospel, that it contains treasures of wisdom, as yet
   concealed and hidden from angels. But some one may object, and say that
   it is not reasonable that things should be open and known to us which
   are hidden from angels, who always see the face of God, and are his
   ministers in ruling the church, and in the administration of all his
   blessings. To this I answer, that things are open to us as far as we
   see them in the mirror of the word; but our knowledge is not said to be
   higher than that of angels; Peter only means that such things are
   promised to us as angels desire to see fulfilled. Paul says that by the
   calling of the Gentiles the wonderful wisdom of God was made known to
   angels. for it was a spectacle to them, when Christ gathered into one
   body the lost world, alienated for so many ages from the hope of life.
   Thus daily they see with admiration the magnificent works of God in the
   government of his church. How much greater will their admiration be, at
   witnessing the last display of divine justice, when the kingdom of
   Christ shall be completed! This is as yet hidden, the revelation of
   which they still expect and justly wish to see.

   The passage indeed admits of a twofold meaning; either that the
   treasure we have in the gospel fills the angels with a desire to see
   it, as it is a sight especially delightful to them; or that they
   anxiously desire to see the kingdom of Christ, the living image of
   which is set forth in the gospel. But the last seems to me to be the
   most suitable meaning.

   1 Peter 1:13-16

   13. Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the
   end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of
   Jesus Christ;

   13. Quare succincti lumbis mentis vestrae, sobrii, perfecte sperate in
   eam quae ad vos defertur gratiam, in revelatione Jesu Christi;

   14. As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the
   former lusts in your ignorance:

   14. Tanquam filii obedientes, non conformati pristinis, quae in
   ignorantia vestra regnarunt, cupiditatibus:

   15. But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
   manner of conversation;

   15. Sed quaemadmodum is qui vos vocavit sanctus est, ita ipsi sancti in
   tota conversatione reddamini;

   16. Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

   16. Propterea quòd scriptum est, Sancti estote, quia ego sanctus sum.
   (Leviticus 11:44; 19:2; 20:7.)


   From the greatness and excellency of grace he draws an exhortation,
   that it surely behoved them the more readily to receive the grace of
   God, as the more bountifully he bestowed it upon them. And we must
   notice the connection: he had said, that so elevated was the kingdom of
   Christ, to which the gospel calls us, that even angels in heaven desire
   to see it; what then ought to be done by us who are in the world?
   Doubtless, as long as we live on earth, so great is the distance
   between us and Christ, that in vain he invites us to himself. It is
   hence necessary for us to put off the image of Adam and to cast aside
   the whole world and all hinderances, that being thus set at liberty we
   may rise upwards to Christ. And he exhorted those to whom he wrote, to
   be prepared and sober, and to hope for the graces offered to them, and
   also to renounce the world and their former life, and to be conformed
   to the will of God. [15]

   Then the first part of the exhortation is, to gird up the loins of
   their mind and to direct their thoughts to the hope of the grace
   presented to them. In the second par, he prescribes the manner, that
   having their minds changed, they were to be formed after the image of
   God.

   13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind It is a similitude taken
   from an ancient custom; for when they had long garments, they could not
   make a journey, nor conveniently do any work, without being girded up.
   Hence these expressions, to gird up one's-self for a work or an
   undertaking. He then bids them to remove all impediments, that being
   set at liberty they might go on to God. Those who philosophize more
   refinedly about the loins, as though he commanded lusts to be
   restrained and checked, depart from the real meaning of the Apostle,
   for these words mean the same with those of Christ,

   "Let your loins be girded about, and burning lamps in your hands,"
   (Luke 12:35,)

   except that Peter doubles the metaphor by ascribing loins to the mind.
   And he intimates that our minds are held entangled by the passing cares
   of the world and by vain desires, so that they rise not upward to God.
   Whosoever, then, really wishes to have this hope, let him learn in the
   first place to disentangle himself from the world, and gird up his mind
   that it may not turn aside to vain affections. And for the same purpose
   he enjoins sobriety, which immediately follows; for he commends not
   temperance only in eating and drinking, but rather spiritual sobriety,
   when all our thoughts and affections are so kept as not to be
   inebriated with the allurements of this world. For since even the least
   taste of them stealthily draws us away from God, when one plunges
   himself into these, he must necessarily become sleepy and stupid, and
   he forgets God and the things of God.

   Hope to the end, or, Perfectly hope. He intimates that those who let
   their minds loose on vanity, did not really and sincerely hope for the
   grace of God; for though they had some hope, yet as they vacillated and
   were tossed to and fro in the world, there was no solidity in their
   hope. Then he says, for the grace which will be brought to you, in
   order that they might be more prompt to receive it. God ought to be
   sought, though far off; but he comes of his own will to meet us. How
   great, then, must be our ingratitude if we neglect the grace that is
   thus set before us! This amplification, then, is especially intended to
   stimulate our hope.

   What he adds, At the revelation of Jesus Christ, may be explained in
   two ways: that the doctrine of the Gospel reveals Christ to us; and
   that, as we see him as yet only through a mirror and enigmatically, a
   full revelation is deferred to the last day. The first meaning is
   approved by Erasmus, nor do I reject it. The second seems, however, to
   be more suitable to the passage. For the object of Peter was to call us
   away beyond the world; for this purpose the fittest thing was the
   recollection of Christ's coming. For when we direct our eyes to this
   event, this world becomes crucified to us, and we to the world.
   Besides, according to this meaning, Peter used the expression shortly
   before. Nor is it a new thing for the apostles to employ the
   preposition en in the sense of eis. Thus, then, I explain the passage,
   -- "You have no need to make a long journey that you may attain the
   grace of God; for God anticipates you; inasmuch as he brings it to
   you." But as the fruition of it will not be until Christ appears from
   heaven, in whom is hid the salvation of the godly, there is need, in
   the meantime, of hope; for the grace of Christ is now offered to us in
   vain, except we patiently wait until the coming of Christ.

   14 As obedient children He first intimates that we are called by the
   Lord to the privilege and honor of adoption through the Gospel; and,
   secondly, that we are adopted for this end, that he might have us as
   his obedient children. For though obedience does not make us children,
   as the gift of adoption is gratuitous, yet it distinguishes children
   from aliens. How far, indeed, this obedience extends, Peter shews, when
   he forbids God's children to conform to or to comply with the desires
   of this world, and when he exhorts them, on the contrary, to conform to
   the will of God. The sum of the whole law, and of all that God requires
   of us, is this, that his image should shine forth in us, so that we
   should not be degenerate children. But this cannot be except we be
   renewed and put off the image of old Adam.

   Hence we learn what Christians ought to propose to themselves as an
   object throughout life, that is, to resemble God in holiness and
   purity. But as all the thoughts and feelings of our flesh are in
   opposition to God, and the whole bent of our mind is enmity to him,
   hence Peter begins with the renunciation of the world; and certainly,
   whenever the Scripture speaks of the renewal of God's image in us, it
   begins here, that the old man with his lusts is to be destroyed.

   In your ignorance The time of ignorance he calls that before they were
   called into the faith of Christ. We hence learn that unbelief is the
   fountain of all evils. For he does not use the word ignorance, as we
   commonly do; for that Platonic dogma is false, that ignorance alone is
   the cause of sin. But yet, how much soever conscience may reprove the
   unbelieving, nevertheless they go astray as the blind in darkness,
   because they know not the right way, and they are without the true
   light. According to this meaning, Paul says,

   "Ye henceforth walk not as the Gentiles, in the vanity of their mind,
   who have the mind darkened, being alienated from the life of God,
   because of the ignorance that is in them."
   (Ephesians 4:17.)

   Where the knowledge of God is not, there darkness, error, vanity,
   destitution of light and life, prevail. These things, however, do not
   render it impossible that the ungodly should be conscious of doing
   wrong when they sin, and know that their judge is in heaven, and feel
   an executioner within them. In short, as the kingdom of God is a
   kingdom of light, all who are alienated from him must necessarily be
   blind and go astray in a labyrinth.

   We are in the meantime reminded, that we are for this end illuminated
   as to the knowledge of God, that we may no longer be carried away by
   roving lusts. Hence, as much progress any one has made in newness of
   life, so much progress has he made in the knowledge of God.

   Here a question arises, -- Since he addressed the Jews, who were
   acquainted with the law, and were brought up in the worship of the only
   true God, why did he charge them with ignorance and blindness, as
   though they were heathens? To this I answer, that it hence appears how
   profitless is all knowledge without Christ. When Paul exposed the vain
   boasting of those who wished to be wise apart from Christ, he justly
   said in one short sentence, that they did not hold the head.
   (Colossians 2:19.) Such were the Jews; being otherwise imbued with
   numberless corruptions, they had a veil over the eyes, so that they did
   not see Christ in the Law. The doctrine in which they had been taught
   was indeed a true light; but they were blind in the midst of light, as
   long as the Sun of Righteousness was hid to them. But if Peter declares
   that the literal disciples even of the Law were in darkness like the
   heathens, as long as they were ignorant of Christ, the only true wisdom
   of God, with how much greater care it behoves us to strive for the
   knowledge of him!

   15 He who hath called you is holy He reasons from the end for which we
   are called. God sets us apart as a peculiar people for himself; then we
   ought to be free from all pollutions. And he quotes a sentence which
   had been often repeated by Moses. For as the people of Israel were on
   every side surrounded by heathens, from whom they might have easily
   adopted the worst examples and innumerable corruptions, the Lord
   frequently recalled them to himself, as though he had said, "Ye have to
   do with me, ye are mine; then abstain from the pollutions of the
   Gentiles." We are too ready to look to men, so as to follow their
   common way of living. Thus it happens, that some lead others in troops
   to all kinds of evil, until the Lord by his calling separates them.

   In bidding us to be holy like himself, the proportion is not that of
   equals; but we ought to advance in this direction as far as our
   condition will bear. And as even the most perfect are always very far
   from coming up to the mark, we ought daily to strive more and more. And
   we ought to remember that we are not only told what our duty is, but
   that God also adds, "I am he who sanctify you."

   It is added, In all manner of conversation, or, in your whole conduct.
   There is then no part of our life which is not to be redolent with this
   good odour of holiness. For we see that in the smallest things and
   almost insignificant, the Lord accustomed his people to the practice of
   holiness, in order that they might exercise a more diligent care as to
   themselves.

   1 Peter 1:17-22

   17. And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
   judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning
   here in fear:

   17. Et si Patrem invocatis, eum qui sine personae acceptione secundum
   cujusque opus judicat, in timore conversantes, tempus incolatus vestri
   transigite;

   18. Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible
   things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by
   tradition from your fathers;

   18. Scientes quòd non corruptibilibus, argento vel auro, redempti sitis
   à vana conversatione à patribus tradita;

   19. But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish
   and without spot:

   19. Sed pretioso sanguine velut agni immaculati et incontaminati
   Christi;

   20. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but
   was manifest in these last times for you,

   20. Qui praeordinatus quidem fuerat ante conditum mundum, manifestatus
   autem est extremis temporibus propter vos;

   21. Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and
   gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.

   21. Qui per ipsum creditis in Deum, qui eum suscitavit ex mortuis, et
   gloriam illi dedit, ut fides vestra et spes sit in Deum;

   22. Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the
   Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one
   another with a pure heart fervently:

   22. Purificantes animas vestras in obedientia veritatis per Spiritum,
   in fraternam charitatem non fictam, ex puro corde diligite vos mutuò
   impensè.


   17 And if ye call on the Father They are said here to call on God the
   Father, who professed themselves to be his children, as Moses says,
   that the name of Jacob was called on Ephraim and Manasseh, that they
   might be counted his children. (Genesis 48:16.) According to this
   meaning also, we say in French reclamer But he had a regard to what he
   had said before, "as obedient children." And from the character of the
   Father himself, he shews what sort of obedience ought to be rendered.
   He judges, he says, without looking on the person, that is, no outward
   mask is of any account with him, as the case is with men, but he sees
   the heart, (1 Samuel 16:7;) and his eyes look on faithfulness.
   (Jeremiah 5:3.) This also is what Paul means when he says that God's
   judgment is according to truth, (Romans 2:2;) for he there inveighs
   against hypocrites, who think that they deceive God by a vain pretense.
   The meaning is, that we by no means discharge our duty towards God,
   when we obey him only in appearance; for he is not a mortal man, whom
   the outward appearance pleases, but he reads what we are inwardly in
   our hearts. He not only prescribes laws for our feet and hands, but he
   also requires what is just and right as to the mind and spirit.

   By saying, According to every man's work, he does not refer to merit or
   to reward; for Peter does not speak here of the merits of works, nor of
   the cause of salvation, but he only reminds us, that there will be no
   looking to the person before the tribunal of God, but that what will be
   regarded will be the real sincerity of the heart. In this place faith
   also is included in the work. It hence appears evident how foolish and
   puerile is the inference that is drawn, -- "God is such that he judges
   every one of us by the integrity of his conscience, not by the outward
   appearance; then we obtain salvation by works."

   The fear that is mentioned, stands opposed to heedless security, such
   as is wont to creep in, when there is a hope of deceiving with
   impunity. For, as God's eyes are such that they penetrate into the
   hidden recesses of the heart, we ought to walk with him carefully and
   not negligently. He calls the present life a sojourning, not in the
   sense in which he called the Jews to whom he was writing sojourners, at
   the beginning of the Epistle, but because all the godly are in this
   world pilgrims. (Hebrews 11:13,38.)

   18 Forasmuch as ye know, or, knowing. Here is another reason, drawn
   from the price of our redemption, which ought always to be remembered
   when our salvation is spoken of. For to him who repudiates or despises
   the grace of the gospel, not only his own salvation is worthless, but
   also the blood of Christ, by which God has manifested its value. But we
   know how dreadfully sacrilegious it is to regard as common the blood of
   the Son of God. There is hence nothing which ought so much to stimulate
   us to the practice of holiness, as the memory of this price of our
   redemption.

   Silver and gold For the sake of amplifying he mentions these things in
   contrast, so that we may know that the whole world, and all things
   deemed precious by men, are nothing to the excellency and value of this
   price.

   But he says that they had been redeemed from their vain conversation,
   [16] in order that we might know that the whole life of man, until he
   is converted to Christ, is a ruinous labyrinth of wanderings. He also
   intimates, that it is not through our merits that we are restored to
   the right way, but because it is God's will that the price, offered for
   our salvation, should be effectual in our behalf. Then the blood of
   Christ is not only the pledge of our salvation, but also the cause of
   our calling.

   Moreover, Peter warns us to beware lest our unbelief should render this
   price void or of no effect. As Paul boasts that he worshipped God with
   a pure conscience from his forefathers, (2 Timothy 1:3,) and as he also
   commends to Timothy for his imitation the piety of his grandmother
   Lois, and of his mother Eunice, (2 Timothy 1:5,) and as Christ also
   said of the Jews that they knew whom they worshipped (John 4:22,) it
   may seem strange that Peter should assert that the Jews of his time
   learnt nothing from their fathers but mere vanity. To this I answer,
   that Christ, when he declared that the way or the knowledge of true
   religion belonged to the Jews, referred to the law and the commandments
   of God rather than to the people; for the temple had not to no purpose
   been built at Jerusalem, nor was God worshipped there according to the
   fancies of men, but according to what was prescribed in the Law; he,
   therefore, said that the Jews were not going astray while observing the
   Law. As to Paul's forefathers, and as to Lois, Eunice, and similar
   cases, there is no doubt but that God ever had at least a small remnant
   among that people, in whom sincere piety continued, while the body of
   the people had become wholly corrupt, and had plunged themselves into
   all kinds of errors. Innumerable superstitions were followed, hypocrisy
   prevailed, the hope of salvation was built on the merest trifles; they
   were not only imbued with false opinions, but also fascinated with the
   grossest dotages; and they who had been scattered to various parts of
   the world, were implicated in still greater corruptions. In short, the
   greater part of that nation had either wholly fallen away from true
   religion, or had much degenerated. When, therefore, Peter condemned the
   doctrine of the fathers, he viewed it as unconnected with Christ, who
   is the soul and the truth of the Law.

   But we hence learn, that as soon as men depart from Christ, they go
   fatally astray. In vain is pretended in this case the authority of the
   Fathers or an ancient custom. For the Prophet Ezekiel cried to the
   Jews,

   "Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers."
   (Ezekiel 20:18.)

   This ought also to be no less attended to by us in the present day;
   for, in order that the redemption of Christ may be effectual and useful
   to us, we must renounce our former life, though derived from the
   teaching and practice of our fathers. Thrice foolish, then, are the
   Papists, who think that the name of Fathers is a sufficient defense for
   all their superstitions, so that they boldly reject whatever is brought
   forward from the Word of God.

   19 As of a lamb He means by this similitude, that we have in Christ
   whatever had been shadowed forth by the ancient sacrifices, though he
   especially alludes to the Paschal lamb. But let us hence learn what
   benefit the reading of the Law brings us in this respect; for, though
   the rite of sacrificing is abolished, yet it assists our faith not a
   little, to compare the reality with the type, so that we may seek in
   the former what the latter contains. Moses ordered a whole or perfect
   lamb, without blemish, to be chosen for the Passover. The same thing is
   often repeated as to the sacrifices, as in Leviticus 23; in Numbers 28;
   and in other places. Peter, by applying this to Christ, teaches us that
   he was a suitable victim, and approved by God, for he was perfect,
   without any blemish; had he had any defect in him, he could not have
   been rightly offered to God, nor could he pacify his wrath.

   20 Who verily was foreordained He again by a comparison amplifies the
   grace of God, with which he had peculiarly favored the men of that age.
   For it was not a common or a small favor that God deferred the
   manifestation of Christ to that time, when yet he had ordained him in
   his eternal council for the salvation of the world. At the same time,
   however, he reminds us, that it was not a new or a sudden thing as to
   God that Christ appeared as a Savior; and this is what ought especially
   to be known. For, in addition to this, that novelty is always
   suspicious, what would be the stability of our faith, if we believed
   that a remedy for mankind had suddenly occurred at length to God after
   some thousands of years? In short, we cannot confidently recumb on
   Christ, except we are convinced that eternal salvation is in him, and
   always has been in him. Besides, Peter addressed the Jews, who had
   heard that he had already been long ago promised; and though they
   understood nothing true or clear or certain respecting his power and
   office, yet there remained among them a persuasion, that a Redeemer had
   been promised by God to the fathers.

   It may yet be asked, As Adam did not fall before the creation of the
   world, how was it that Christ had been appointed the Redeemer? for a
   remedy is posterior to the disease. My reply is, that this is to be
   referred to God's foreknowledge; for doubtless God, before he created
   man, foresaw that he would not stand long in his integrity. Hence he
   ordained, according to his wonderful wisdom and goodness, that Christ
   should be the Redeemer, to deliver the lost race of man from ruin. For
   herein shines forth more fully the unspeakable goodness of God, that he
   anticipated our disease by the remedy of his grace, and provided a
   restoration to life before the first man had fallen into death. If the
   reader wishes for more on this subject, he may find it in my
   Institutes.

   But was manifest, or manifested. Included in these words, as I think,
   is not only the personal appearance of Christ, but also the
   proclamation of the Gospel. For, by the coming of Christ, God executed
   what he had decreed; and what he had obscurely indicated to the fathers
   is now clearly and plainly made known to us by the Gospel. He says that
   this was done in these last times, meaning the same as when Paul says,

   "In the fullness of time," (Galatians 4:4;)

   for it was the mature season and the full time which God in his counsel
   had appointed.

   For you He does not exclude the fathers, to whom the promise had not
   been useless; but as God has favored us more than them, he intimates
   that the greater the amplitude of grace towards us, the more reverence
   and ardor and care are required of us.

   21 Who believe The manifestation of Christ refers not to all
   indiscriminately, but belongs to those only on whom he by the Gospel
   shines. But we must notice the words, Who by him believe in God: here
   is shortly expressed what faith is. For, since God is incomprehensible,
   faith could never reach to him, except it had an immediate regard to
   Christ. Nay, there are two reasons why faith could not be in God,
   except Christ intervened as a Mediator: first, the greatness of the
   divine glory must be taken to the account, and at the same time the
   littleness of our capacity. Our acuteness is doubtless very far from
   being capable of ascending so high as to comprehend God. Hence all
   knowledge of God without Christ is a vast abyss which immediately
   swallows up all our thoughts. A clear proof of this we have, not only
   in the Turks and the Jews, who in the place of God worship their own
   dreams, but also in the Papists. Common is that axiom of the schools,
   that God is the object of faith. Thus of hidden majesty, Christ being
   overlooked, they largely and refinedly speculate; but with what
   success? They entangle themselves in astounding dotages, so that there
   is no end to their wanderings. For faith, as they think, is nothing
   else but an imaginative speculation. Let us, therefore, remember, that
   Christ is not in vain called the image of the invisible God,
   (Colossians 1:15;) but this name is given to him for this reason,
   because God cannot be known except in him.

   The second reason is, that as faith unites us to God, we shun and dread
   every access to him, except a Mediator comes who can deliver us from
   fear. For sin, which reigns in us, renders us hateful to God and him to
   us. Hence, as soon as mention is made of God, we must necessarily be
   filled with dread; and if we approach him, his justice is like fire,
   which will wholly consume us.

   It is hence evident that we cannot believe in God except through
   Christ, in whom God in a manner makes himself little, that he might
   accommodate himself to our comprehension; and it is Christ alone who
   can tranquillize consciences, so that we may dare to come in confidence
   to God.

   That raised him up from the dead He adds, that Christ had been raised
   up from the dead, in order that their faith and hope, by which they
   were supported, might have a firm foundation. And hereby again is
   confuted the gloss respecting universal and indiscriminate faith in
   God; for had there been no resurrection of Christ, still God would
   remain in heaven. But Peter says that he would not have been believed
   in, except Christ had risen. It is then evident, that faith is
   something else than to behold the naked majesty of God. And rightly
   does Peter speak in this manner; for it belongs to faith to penetrate
   into heaven, that it may find the Father there: how could it do so,
   except it had Christ as a leader?

   "By him," says Paul, "we have confidence of access."
   (Ephesians 3:12.)

   It is said also, in Hebrews 4:16, that relying on our high priest, we
   can come with confidence to the throne of grace. Hope is the anchor of
   the soul, which enter into the inner part of the sanctuary; but not
   without Christ going before. (Hebrews 6:19.) Faith is our victory
   against the world, (1 John 5:4) and what is it that makes it
   victorious, except that Christ, the Lord of heaven and earth, has us
   under his guardianship and protection?

   As, then, our salvation depends on the resurrection of Christ and his
   supreme power, faith and hope find here what can support them. For,
   except he had by rising again triumphed over death, and held now the
   highest sovereignty, to protect us by his power, what would become of
   us, exposed to so great a power as that of our enemies, and to such
   violent attacks? Let us, therefore, learn to what mark we ought to
   direct our aim, so that we may really believe in God.

   22 Seeing ye have purified your souls, or, Purifying your souls.
   Erasmus badly renders the words, "Who have purified," etc. For Peter
   does not declare what they had done, but reminds them of what they
   ought to do. The participle is indeed in the past tense, but it may be
   rendered as a gerund, "By purifying, etc." The meaning is, that their
   souls would not be capable of receiving grace until they were purified,
   and by this our uncleanness is proved. [17] But that he might not seem
   to ascribe to us the power of purifying our souls, he immediately adds,
   through the Spirit; as though he had said, "Your souls are to be
   purified, but as ye cannot do this, offer them to God, that he may take
   away your filth by his Spirit." He only mentions souls, though they
   needed to be cleansed also from the defilements of the flesh, as Paul
   bids the Corinthians, (2 Corinthians 7:1;) but as the principal
   uncleanness is within, and necessarily draws with it that which is
   outward, Peter was satisfied with mentioning only the former, as though
   he had said, that not outward actions only ought to be corrected, but
   the very hearts ought to be thoroughly reformed.

   He afterwards points out the manner, for purity of soul consists in
   obedience to God. Truth is to be taken for the rule which God
   prescribes to us in the Gospel. Nor does he speak only of works, but
   rather faith holds here the primacy. Hence Paul specially teaches us in
   the first and last chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, that faith is
   that by which we obey God; and Peter in Acts, the fifteenth chapter,
   bestows on it this eulogy, that God by it purifies the heart.

   Unto love of the brethren, or, Unto brotherly love. He briefly reminds
   us what God especially requires in our life, and the mark to which all
   our endeavors should be directed. So Paul in the first chapter of the
   Epistle to the Ephesians, when speaking of the perfection of the
   faithful, makes it to consist in love. And this is what we ought the
   more carefully to notice, because the world makes its own sanctity to
   consist of the veriest trifles, and almost overlooks this the chief
   thing. We see how the Papists weary themselves beyond measure with
   thousand invented superstitions: in the meantime, the last thing is
   that love which God especially commends. This, then, is the reason why
   Peter calls our attention to it, when speaking of a life rightly
   formed.

   He had before spoken of the mortification of the flesh, and of our
   conformity with the will of God; but he now reminds us of what God
   would have us to cultivate through life, that is, mutual love towards
   one another; for by that we testify also that we love God; and by this
   evidence God proves who they are who really love him.

   He calls it unfeigned, (anupokriton), as Paul calls faith in 1 Timothy
   1:5; for nothing is more difficult than to love our neighbors in
   sincerity. For the love of ourselves rules, which is full of hypocrisy;
   and besides, every one measures his love, which he shews to others, by
   his own advantage, and not by the rule of doing good. He adds,
   fervently; for the more slothful we are by nature, the more ought every
   one to stimulate himself to fervor and earnestness, and that not only
   once, but more and more daily.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [16] The verb lutroo means properly to redeem by a price from tyranny
   or bondage, but its meaning here, and in Luke 24:21, and Titus 2:14, is
   merely to deliver. "Vain conversation" signifies a useless, profitless
   mode of living. -- Ed.

   [17] It is better to keep the tense of the participle, -- "Having
   purified (or, since ye have purified) your souls by obeying the truth
   through the Spirit to an unfeigned love of the brethren, love ye one
   another fervently from a pure heart; having been born again," etc. The
   order here is similar to what is often found in Scripture; purification
   is mentioned before regeneration, as being the most visible and the
   effect; then what goes before it as being in a manner the cause. -- Ed.

   1 Peter 1:23-25

   23. Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by
   the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

   23. Regeniti non ex semine corruptibili, sed incorruptibili, per
   sermonem viventis Dei et manentis in aeternum.

   24. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower
   of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:

   24. Quandoquidem omnis caro tanquam herba, et omnis gloria ejus tanquam
   flos herbae; exaruit herba et flos ejus decidit:

   25. But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
   which by the gospel is preached unto you.

   25. Verbum autem Domini manet in aeternum; hoc autem est verbum quod
   annuntiatum est vobis.


   23 Being born again Here is another reason for an exhortation, -- that
   since they were new men and born again of God, it behoved them to form
   a life worthy of God and of their spiritual regeneration. And this
   seems to be connected with a verse in the next chapter respecting the
   milk of the word, which they were to seek, that their way of living
   might correspond with their birth. It may, however, be extended wider,
   so as to be connected also with what has gone before; for Peter
   collected together those things which may lead us to an upright and a
   holy life. The object, then, of Peter was to teach us that we cannot be
   Christians without regeneration; for the Gospel is not preached, that
   it may be only heard by us, but that it may, as a seed of immortal
   life, altogether reform our hearts. [18] Moreover, the corruptible seed
   is set in opposition to God's word, in order that the faithful might
   know that they ought to renounce their former nature, and that it might
   be more evident how much is the difference between the children of Adam
   who are born only into the world, and the children of God who are
   renewed into a heavenly life. But as the construction of the Greek text
   is doubtful, we may read, "the living word of God," as well as, "the
   word of the living God." As, however, the latter reading is less
   forced, I prefer it; though it must be observed, that the term is
   applied to God owing to the character of the passage. For, as in
   Hebrews 4:12, because God sees all things, and nothing is hid from him,
   the apostle argues that the word of God penetrates into the inmost
   marrow, so as to discern thoughts and feelings; so, when Peter in this
   place calls him the living God, who abides for ever, he refers to the
   word, in which the perpetuity of God shines forth as in a living
   mirror.

   24 For all flesh He aptly quotes the passage from Isaiah to prove both
   clauses; that is, to make it evident how fading and miserable is the
   first birth of man, and how great is the grace of the new birth. For as
   the Prophet there speaks of the restoration of the Church, to prepare
   the way for it, he reduces men to nothing lest they should flatter
   themselves. I know that the words are wrongly turned by some to another
   sense; for some explain them of the Assyrians, as though the Prophet
   said, that there was no reason for the Jews to fear so much from flesh,
   which is like a fading flower. Others think that the vain confidence
   which the Jews reposed in human aids, is reproved. But the Prophet
   himself disproves both these views, by adding, that the people were as
   grass; for he expressly condemns the Jews for vanity, to whom he
   promised restoration in the name of the Lord. This, then, is what I
   have already said, that until their own emptiness has been shewn to
   men, they are not prepared to receive the grace of God. In short, such
   is the meaning of the Prophet: as exile was to the Jews like death, he
   promised them a new consolation, even that God would send prophets with
   a command of this kind. The Lord, he says, will yet say, "Comfort ye my
   people;" and that in the desert and the waste, the prophetic voice
   would yet be heard, in order that a way might be prepared for the Lord.
   (Isaiah 40:6.)

   And as the obstinate pride which filled them, must have been
   necessarily purged from their minds, in order that an access might be
   open for God, the Prophet added what Peter relates here respecting the
   vanishing glory of the flesh. What is man? he says -- grass; what is
   the glory of man? the flower of the grass. For as it was difficult to
   believe that man, in whom so much excellency appears, is like grass,
   the Prophet made a kind of concession, as though he had said, "Be it,
   indeed, that flesh has some glory; but lest that should dazzle your
   eyes, know that the flower soon withers." He afterwards shews how
   suddenly everything that seems beautiful in men vanishes, even through
   the blowing of the Spirit of God; and by this he intimates, that man
   seems to be something until he comes to God, but that his whole
   brightness is as nothing in his presence; that, in a word, his glory is
   in this world, and has no place in the heavenly kingdom.

   The grass withereth, or, has withered. Many think that this refers only
   to the outward man; but they are mistaken; for we must consider the
   comparison between God's word and man. For if he meant only the body
   and what belongs to the present life, he ought to have said, in the
   second place, that the soul was far more excellent. But what he sets in
   opposition to the grass and its flower, is the word of God. It then
   follows, that in man nothing but vanity is found. Therefore, when
   Isaiah spoke of flesh and its glory, he meant the whole man, such as he
   is in himself; for what he ascribed as peculiar to God's word, he
   denied to man. In short, the Prophet speaks of the same thing as Christ
   does in John 3:3, that man is wholly alienated from the kingdom of God,
   that he is nothing but an earthly, fading, and empty creature, until he
   is born again.

   25 But the word of God The Prophet does not shew what the word of God
   is in itself, but what we ought to think of it; for since man is vanity
   in himself, it remains that he ought to seek life elsewhere. Hence
   Peter ascribes power and efficacy to God's word, according to the
   authority of the Prophet, so that it can confer on us what is real,
   solid, and eternal. For this was what the Prophet had in view, that
   there is no permanent life but in God, and that this is communicated to
   us by the word. However fading, then, is the nature of man, yet he is
   made eternal by the word; for he is re-moulded and becomes a new
   creature.

   This is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you, or, which
   has been declared to you. He first reminds us, that when the word of
   God is mentioned, we are very foolish if we imagine it to be remote
   from us in the air or in heaven; for we ought to know that it has been
   revealed to us by the Lord. What, then, is this word of the Lord, which
   gives us life? Even the Law, the Prophets, the Gospel. Those who wander
   beyond these limits of revelation, find nothing but the impostures of
   Satan and his dotages, and not the word of the Lord. We ought the more
   carefully to notice this, because impious and Luciferian men, craftily
   allowing to God's word its own honor, at the same time attempt to draw
   us away from the Scriptures, as that unprincipled man, Agrippa, who
   highly extols the eternity of God's word, and yet treats with
   scurrility the Prophets, and thus indirectly laughs to scorn the Word
   of God.

   In short, as I have already reminded you, no mention is here made of
   the word which lies hid in the bosom of God, but of that which has
   proceeded from his mouth, and has come to us. So again it ought to be
   borne in mind, that God designed by the Apostles and Prophets to speak
   to us, and their mouths is the mouth of the only true God.

   Then, when Peter says, Which has been announced, or declared, to you,
   he intimates that the word is not to be sought elsewhere than in the
   Gospel preached to us; and truly we know not the way of eternal life
   otherwise than by faith. But there can be no faith, except we know that
   the word is destined for us.

   To the same purpose is what Moses said to the people,

   "Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, etc.; nigh is
   the word, in thy mouth and in thy heart."
   (Deuteronomy 30:12.)

   That these words agree with what Peter says, Paul shews Romans 10:6,
   where he teaches us that it was the word of faith which he preached.

   There is here, besides, no common eulogy on preaching; for Peter
   declares that what is preached is the life-giving word. God alone is
   indeed he who regenerates us; but for that purpose he employs the
   ministry of men; and on this account Paul glories that the Corinthians
   had been spiritually begotten by him. (1 Corinthians 4:15.) It is
   indeed certain that those who plant and those who water, are nothing;
   but whenever God is pleased to bless their labor, he makes their
   doctrine efficacious by the power of his Spirit; and the voice which is
   in itself mortal, is made an instrument to communicate eternal life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [18] Most commentators, like Calvin, represent the seed as the word;
   but the construction does not admit this; the words are, "Having been
   begotten from a seed, not corruptible, but incorruptible, through the
   living word of God, and for-ever abiding." The "seed" denotes evidently
   the vital principle of grace, the new nature, the restored image of
   God; it is the same with what John means when he says, "His seed (that
   is, of God) remaineth in him." (1 John 3:9.) Then "the word" is set
   forth as the means or instrument by which this seed is implanted. The
   "living" here does not mean life-giving, as some interpret it, but
   stands opposed to what ceases to be valid: and "for-ever abiding" more
   fully expresses its meaning. The metaphor in the parable of the sower
   is quite different: the word there is compared to a seed sown on bad or
   good ground; but here the turning of a bad into a good ground is the
   subject; and in this process the word is employed as an instrument. --

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Peter 2:1-5

   1. Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
   and envies, and all evil speakings,

   1. Proinde deposita omni malitia et omni dolo et simulationibus et
   invidiis et omnibus obtrectationibus,

   2. As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may
   grow thereby:

   2. Tanquam modò geniti infantes, lac rationale et dolo vacuum appetite,
   ut per illud subolescatis:

   3. If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

   3. Si quidem gustastis quòd benignus sit Dominus;

   4. To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,
   but chosen of God, and precious,

   4. Ad quem accedentes, qui est lapis vivus, ab hominibus quidera
   reprobatus, apud Deum vero electus ac pretiosus;

   5. Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy
   priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by
   Jesus Christ.

   5. Ipsi quoque tanquam vivi lapides, aedificamini, domus spirituales,
   sacerdotium sanctum, ad offerendas spirituales hostias, acceptas Deo
   per Jesum Christum.


   After having taught the faithful that they had been regenerated by the
   word of God, he now exhorts them to lead a life corresponding with
   their birth. For if we live in the Spirit, we ought also to walk in the
   Spirit, as Paul says. (Galatians 5:25.) It is not, then, sufficient for
   us to have been once called by the Lord, except we live as new
   creatures. This is the meaning. But as to the words, the Apostle
   continues the same metaphor. For as we have been born again, he
   requires from us a life like that of infants; by which he intimates
   that we are to put off the old man and his works. Hence this verse
   agrees with what Christ says,

   "Except ye become like this little child,
   ye shall not enter into the kingdom of God."
   (Matthew 18:3.)

   Infancy is here set by Peter in opposition to the ancientness of the
   flesh, which leads to corruption; and under the word milk, he includes
   all the feelings of spiritual life. For there is also in part a
   contrast between the vices which he enumerates and the sincere milk of
   the word; as though he had said, "Malice and hypocrisy belong to those
   who are habituated to the corruptions of the world; they have imbibed
   these vices: what pertains to infancy is sincere simplicity, free from
   all guile. Men, when grown up, become imbued with envy, they learn to
   slander one another, they are taught the arts of mischief; in short,
   they become hardened in every kind of evil: infants, owing to their
   age, do not yet know what it is to envy, to do mischief, or the like
   things." He then compares the vices, in which the oldness of the flesh
   indulges, to strong food; and milk is called that way of living
   suitable to innocent nature and simple infancy.

   1. All malice There is not here a complete enumeration of all those
   things which we ought to lay aside; but when the Apostles speak of the
   old man, they lay down as examples some of those vices which mark his
   whole character.

   "Known," says Paul, "are the works of the flesh, which are these,"
   (Galatians 5:19;)

   and yet he does not enumerate them all; but in those few things, as in
   a mirror, we may see that immense mass of filth which proceeds from our
   flesh. So also in other passages, where he refers to the new life, he
   touches only on a few things, by which we may understand the whole
   character.

   What, then, he says amounts to this, -- "Having laid aside the works of
   your former life, such as malice, deceit, dissimulations, envyings, and
   other things of this kind, devote yourselves to things of an opposite
   character, cultivate kindness, honesty," etc. He, in short, urges this,
   that new morals ought to follow a new life.

   2. The sincere milk of the word This passage is commonly explained
   according to the rendering of Erasmus, "Milk not for the body but for
   the soul;" as though the Apostle reminded us by this expression that he
   spoke metaphorically. I rather think that this passage agrees with that
   saying of Paul,

   "Be ye not children in understanding, but in malice."
   (1 Corinthians 14:20.)

   That no one might think that infancy, void of understanding and full of
   fatuity, was commended by him, he in due time meets this objection; so
   he bids them to desire milk free from guile, and yet mixed with right
   understanding. We now see for what purpose he joins these two words,
   rational and guileless, (logikon kai adolos.) For simplicity and
   quickness of understanding are two things apparently opposite; but they
   ought to be mixed together, lest simplicity should become insipid, and
   lest malicious craftiness should creep in for want of understanding.
   This mingling, well regulated, is according, to what Christ says,

   "Be ye wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."
   (Matthew 10:16.)

   And thus is solved the question which might have been otherwise raised.
   [19]

   Paul reproves the Corinthians because they were like children, and
   therefore they could not take strong food, but were fed with milk. (1
   Corinthians 3:1.) Almost the same words are found in Hebrews 5:12. But
   in these passages those are compared to children who remain always
   novices and ignorant scholars in the doctrine of religion, who
   continued in the first elements, and never penetrated into the higher
   knowledge of God. Milk is called the simpler mode of teaching, and one
   suitable to children, when there is no progress made beyond the first
   rudiments. Justly, then, does Paul charge this as a fault, as well as
   the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. But milk, here, is not
   elementary doctrine, which one perpetually learns; and never comes to
   the knowledge of the truth, but a mode of living which has the savor of
   the new birth, when we surrender ourselves to be brought up by God. In
   the same manner infancy is not set in opposition to manhood, or full
   age in Christ, as Paul calls it in Ephesians 4:13, but to the
   ancientness of the flesh and of former life. Moreover, as the infancy
   of the new life is perpetual, so Peter recommends milk as a perpetual
   aliment, for he would have those nourished by it to grow.

   3 If so be that ye have tasted; or, If indeed ye have tasted. He
   alludes to Psalm 34:8,

   "Taste and see that the Lord is good."

   But he says that this taste is to be had in Christ, as, doubtless, our
   souls can find no rest anywhere but in him. But he has drawn the ground
   of his exhortation from the goodness of God, because his kindness,
   which we perceive in Christ, ought to allure us; for what follows,

   To whom coming, is not to be referred simply to God, but to him as he
   is revealed to us in the person of Christ. Now, it cannot be but that
   the grace of God must powerfully draw us to himself and inflame us with
   the love of him by whom we obtain a real perception of it. If Plato
   affirmed this of his Beautiful, of which a shadowy idea only he beheld
   afar off, much more true is this with regard to God.

   Let it then be noticed, that Peter connects an access to God with the
   taste of his goodness. For as the human mind necessarily dreads and
   shuns God, as long as it regards him as rigid and severe; so, as soon
   as he makes known his paternal love to the faithful, it immediately
   follows that they disregard all things and even forget themselves and
   hasten to him. In short, he only makes progress in the Gospel, who in
   heart comes to God.

   But he also shews for what end and to what purpose we ought to come to
   Christ, even that we may have him as our foundation. For since he is
   constituted a stone, he ought to be so to us, so that nothing should be
   appointed for him by the Father in vain or to no purpose. But he
   obviates an offense when he allows that Christ is rejected by men; for,
   as a great part of the world reject him, and even many abhor him, he
   might for this reason be despised by us; for we see that some of the
   ignorant are alienated from the Gospel, because it is not everywhere
   popular, nor does it conciliate favor to its professors. But Peter
   forbids us to esteem Christ the less, however despised he may be by the
   world, because he, notwithstanding, retains his own worth and honor
   before God.

   5. Ye also, as lively or living stones, are built up The verb may be in
   the imperative as well as in the indicative mood, for the termination
   in Greek is ambiguous. But in whatever way it is taken, Peter no doubt
   meant to exhort the faithful to consecrate themselves as a spiritual
   temple to God; for he aptly infers from the design of our calling what
   our duty is. We must further observe, that he constructs one house from
   the whole number of the faithful. For though every one of us is said to
   be the temple of God, yet all are united together in one, and must be
   joined together by mutual love, so that one temple may be made of us
   all. Then, as it is true that each one is a temple in which God dwells
   by his Spirit, so all ought to be so fitted together, that they may
   form one universal temple. This is the case when every one, content
   with his own measure, keeps himself within the limits of his own duty;
   all have, however, something to do with regard to others.

   By calling us living stones and spiritual building, as he had before
   said that Christ is a living stone, he intimates a comparison between
   us and the ancient temple; and this serves to amplify divine grace. For
   the same purpose is what he adds as to spiritual sacrifices For by how
   much the more excellent is the reality than the types, by so much the
   more all things excel in the kingdom of Christ; for we have that
   heavenly exemplar, to which the ancient sanctuary was conformable, and
   everything instituted by Moses under the Law.

   A holy priesthood It is a singular honor, that God should not only
   consecrate us as a temple to himself, in which he dwells and is
   worshipped, but that he should also make us priests. But Peter mentions
   this double honor, in order to stimulate us more effectually to serve
   and worship God. Of the spiritual sacrifices, the first is the offering
   of ourselves, of which Paul speaks in Romans 12:1; for we can offer
   nothing, until we offer to him ourselves as a sacrifice; which is done
   by denying ourselves. Then, afterwards follow prayers, thanksgiving,
   almsdeeds, and all the duties of religion.

   Acceptable to God. It ought also to add not a little to our alacrity,
   when we know that the worship we perform to God is pleasing to him, as
   doubt necessarily brings sloth with it. Here, then, is the third thing
   that enforces the exhortation; for he declares that what is required is
   acceptable to God, lest fear should make us slothful. Idolaters are
   indeed under the influence of great fervor in their fictitious forms of
   worship; but it is so, because Satan inebriates their minds, lest they
   should come to consider their works; but whenever their consciences are
   led to examine things, they begin to stagger. It is, indeed, certain
   that no one will seriously and from the heart devote himself to God,
   until he is fully persuaded that he shall not labor in vain.

   But the Apostle adds, through Jesus Christ There is never found in our
   sacrifices such purity, that they are of themselves acceptable to God;
   our self-denial is never entire and complete, our prayers are never so
   sincere as they ought to be, we are never so zealous and so diligent in
   doing good, but that our works are imperfect, and mingled with many
   vices. Nevertheless, Christ procures favor for them. Then Peter here
   obviates that want of faith which we may have respecting the
   acceptableness of our works, when he says, that they are accepted, not
   for the merit of their own excellency, but through Christ. And it ought
   to kindle the more the ardor of our efforts, when we hear that God
   deals so indulgently with us, that in Christ he sets a value on our
   works, which in themselves deserve nothing. At the same time, the
   words, by or through Christ, may be fitly connected with offering; for
   a similar phrase is found in Hebrews 13:15,

   "Through him let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God."

   The sense, however, will remain the same; for we offer sacrifices
   through Christ, that they may be acceptable to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] Our version here seems to convey the most suitable meaning, by
   taking logikon for tou logou; see similar instances in ver. 13 and 1
   Peter 3:7. It is the wordy milk, or milk made up of the word; the word
   is the milk. Then adolon is to be taken in its secondary meaning: when
   applied to persons, it means undeceitful, or guileless; but when to
   things, genuine, pure, unadulterated, unmixed with anything
   deleterious. We may, therefore, render the words, "Desire the pure milk
   of the word." It is a milk not adulterated by water or by anything
   poisonous. There is no contrast here between milk and strong food; but
   it includes all that is necessary as an aliment for the soul, when
   renewed. The Word had before been represented as the instrument of the
   new birth; it is now spoken of as the food and aliment of the new-born.

   1 Peter 2:6-8

   6. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in
   Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on
   him shall not be confounded.

   6. Propterea etiam continet scriptura, Ecce pono in Sion lapidem
   angularem, electum, pretiosum, et qui crediderit in illo, non pudefiet.

   7. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which
   be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is
   made the head of the corner,

   7. Vobis ergo qui creditis, pretiosus; incredulis vero, Lapis quem
   reprobaverunt aedificantes, hic positus est in caput anguli;

   8. And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which
   stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were
   appointed.

   8. Et Lapis impactionis, et petra offendiculi iis qui impingunt in
   Sermonem, nec credunt; in quod etiam ordinati fuerant.


   6 Wherefore also it is contained in Scripture; or, Wherefore also the
   Scripture contains [20] They who refer the verb "contain" (periechein)
   to Christ, and render it "embrace," because through him all these unite
   together, wholly depart from the meaning of the Apostle. No better is
   another exposition, that Christ excels others; for Peter simply
   intended to quote the testimony of Scripture. [21] He then shews what
   had been taught by the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures, or, which is the
   same thing, that what he adds is contained in them. Nor is it an
   unsuitable confirmation of the preceding verse. For we see for what
   slight reasons, and almost for none, many reject Christ, and some fall
   away from him; but this is a stumblingblock which above all other
   things stands in the way of some; they are drawn away, because not only
   the common people despise and reject Christ, but also those who are
   high in dignity and honor, and seem to excel others. This evil has
   almost ever prevailed in the world, and at this day it prevails much;
   for a great part of mankind judge of Christ according to the false
   opinion of the world. Moreover, such is the ingratitude and impiety of
   men, that Christ is everywhere despised. Thus it is, that while they
   regard one another, few pay him his due honor. Hence Peter reminds us
   of what had been foretold of Christ, lest the contempt or the rejection
   of him should move us from the faith.

   Now, the first passage, which he adduces, is taken from Isaiah 28:16;
   where the Prophet, after having inveighed against the desperate
   wickedness of his own nation, at length adds,

   "Your perfidy shall not prevent God from restoring his church, which
   now through you lies wholly in a ruinous state."
   (Isaiah 28:16)

   The manner of restoration he thus describes, "I will lay in Sion a
   stone." We hence learn that there is no building up of the Church
   without Christ; for there is no other foundation but he, as Paul
   testifies, (1 Corinthians 3:11.) This is no matter of wonder, for all
   our salvation is found only in him. Whosoever, then, turns away from
   him in the least degree, will find his foundation a precipice.

   Therefore the Prophet not only calls him a corner-stone, which connects
   the whole edifice, but also a stone of trial, according to which the
   building is to be measured and regulated; and farther, he calls him a
   solid foundation, which sustains the whole edifice. He is thus, then, a
   corner-stone, that he might be the rule of the building, as well as the
   only foundation. But Peter took from the words of the Prophet what was
   especially suitable to his argument, even that he was a chosen stone,
   and in the highest degree valuable and excellent, and also that on him
   we ought to build. This honor is ascribed to Christ, that how much
   soever he may be despised by the world, he may not be despised by us;
   for by God he is regarded as very precious. But when he calls him a
   corner-stone, he intimates that those have no concern for their
   salvation who do not recumb on Christ. What some have refined on the
   word "corner," as though it meant that Christ joins together Jews and
   Gentiles, as two distinct walls, is not well founded. Let us, then, be
   content with a simple explanation, that he is so called, because the
   weight of the building rests on him.

   We must further observe, that the Prophet introduces God as the
   speaker, for he alone forms and plans his own Church, as it is said in
   Psalm 78:69, that his hand had founded Sion. He, indeed, employs the
   labor and ministry of men in building it; but this is not inconsistent
   with the truth that it is his own work. Christ, then, is the foundation
   of our salvation, because he has been ordained for this end by the
   Father.

   And he says in Sion, because there God's spiritual temple was to have
   its beginning. That our faith, therefore, may firmly rest on Christ, we
   must come to the Law and to the Prophets. For though this stone extends
   to the extreme parts of the world, it was yet necessary for it to be
   located first in Sion, for there at that time was the seat of the
   Church. But it is said to have been then set, when the Father revealed
   him for the purpose of restoring his Church. In short, we must hold
   this, that those only rest on Christ, who keep the unity of the Church,
   for he is not set as a foundation-stone except in Sion. As from Sion
   the Church went forth, which is now everywhere spread, so also from
   Sion our faith has derived its beginning, as Isaiah says,

   "From Sion shall go forth the law,
   and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem." (Isaiah 2:3.)

   Corresponding with this is what is said in the Psalms,

   "The scepter of thy power will the Lord send forth from Sion." (Psalm
   110:2.)

   He that believeth The Prophet does not say in him, but declares
   generally, "He that believeth shall not make haste." As, however, there
   is no doubt but that God sets forth Christ there as the object of our
   faith, the faith of which the Prophet speaks must look on him alone.
   And, doubtless, no one can rightly believe, but he who is fully
   convinced that in Christ he ought wholly to trust.

   But the words of the Prophet may be taken in two ways, either as a
   promise or as an exhortation. The future time is referred to, "He shall
   not make haste;" but in Hebrew the future is often to be taken for an
   imperative, "Let him not make haste." Thus the meaning would be, "Be ye
   not moved in your minds, but quietly entertain your desires, and check
   your feelings, until the Lord will be pleased to fulfill his promise."
   So he says in another place,

   "In silence and in quietness shall be your strength,"
   (Isaiah 30:15.)

   But as the other reading seems to come nearer to Peter's
   interpretation, I give it the preference. Then the sense would not be
   unsuitable, "He who believeth shall not waver" or vacillate; for he has
   a firm and permanent foundation. And it is a valuable truth, that
   relying on Christ, we are beyond the danger of falling. Moreover, to be
   ashamed (pudefieri) means the same thing. Peter has retained the real
   sense of the Prophet, though he has followed the Greek version. [22]

   7. Unto you therefore which believe God having pronounced Christ to be
   a precious and a chosen stone, Peter draws the inference that he is so
   to us. For, no doubt, Christ is there described such as we apprehend
   him by faith, and such as he proves himself to be by real evidences. We
   ought, then, carefully to notice this inference: Christ is a precious
   stone in the sight of God; then he is such to the faithful. It is faith
   alone which reveals to us the value and excellency of Christ.

   But as the design of the Apostle was to obviate the offense which the
   multitude of the ungodly creates, he immediately adds another clause
   respecting the unbelieving, that by rejecting Christ, they do not take
   away the honor granted him by the Father. For this purpose a verse in
   Psalm 118:22, is quoted, that the stone which the builders rejected, is
   become, nevertheless, the head of the corner. It hence follows, that
   Christ, though opposed by his enemies, yet continues in that dignity to
   which he has been appointed by the Father. But we must take notice of
   the two things here said, -- the first is, that Christ was rejected by
   those who bore rule in the Church of God; and the other, that their
   efforts were all in vain, because necessarily fulfilled must have been
   what God had decreed, that is, that he, as the corner-stone, should
   sustain the edifice.

   Moreover, that this passage ought properly to be understood of Christ,
   not only the Holy Spirit is a witness, and Christ himself, who has thus
   explained it, (Matthew 21:42;) but it appears also evident from this,
   that it was thus commonly understood before Christ came into the world;
   nor is there a doubt but this exposition had been delivered as it were
   from hand to hand from the fathers. We hence see that this was, as it
   were, a common saying even among children respecting the Messiah. I
   shall, therefore, no longer discuss this point. We may take it as
   granted, that David was thus rejected by his own age, that he might
   typify Christ.

   Let us now, then, return to the first clause: Christ was rejected by
   the builders. This was first shadowed forth in David; for they who were
   in power counted him as condemned and lost. The same was fulfilled in
   Christ; for they who ruled in the Church, rejected him as far as they
   could. It might have greatly disturbed the weak, when they saw that
   Christ's enemies were so many, even the priests, the elders, and
   teachers, in whom alone the Church was conspicuously seen. In order to
   remove this offense, Peter reminded the faithful that this very thing
   had been predicted by David. He especially addressed the Jews, to whom
   this properly applied; at the same time, this admonition is very useful
   at this day. For they who arrogate to themselves the first place of
   authority in the Church, are Christ's most inveterate enemies, and with
   diabolical fury persecute his Gospel.

   The Pope calls himself the vicar of Christ, and yet we know how
   fiercely he opposes him. This spectacle frightens the simple and
   ignorant. Why is this? even because they consider not that what David
   has predicted happens now. Let us, then, remember that not those only
   were by this prophecy warned who saw Christ rejected by the Scribes and
   Pharisees; but that we are also by it fortified against daily offenses,
   which might otherwise upset our faith. Whenever then, we see those who
   glory in the title of prelates, rising up against Christ, let it come
   to our minds, that the stone is rejected by the builders, according to
   the prediction of David. And as the metaphor of building is common,
   when political or spiritual government is spoken of, so David calls
   them builders, to whom is committed the care and power of governing;
   not because they build rightly, but because they have the name of
   builders, and possess the ordinary power. It hence follows, that those
   in office are not always God's true and faithful ministers. It is,
   therefore, extremely ridiculous in the Pope and his followers to
   arrogate to themselves supreme and indubitable authority on this sole
   pretense, that they are the ordinary governors of the Church. In the
   first place, their vocation to govern the Church is in no way more just
   or more legitimate than that of Heliogabalus to govern the empire. But
   though we should allow them what they unblushingly claim, that they are
   rightly called, yet we see what David declares respecting the ordinary
   rulers of the Church, that they rejected Christ, so that they built a
   stye for swine rather than a temple for God. The other part follows,
   that all the great, proud of their power and dignity, shall not
   prevail, so that Christ should not continue in his own place.

   And a stone of stumbling After having comforted the faithful, that they
   would have in Christ a firm and permanent foundation, though the
   greater part, and even the chief men, allowed him no place in the
   building, he now denounces the punishment which awaits all the
   unbelieving, in order that they might be terrified by their example.
   For this purpose he quotes the testimony of Isaiah 8:14. The Prophet
   there declares that the Lord would be to the Jews a stone of stumbling
   and rock of offense. This properly refers to Christ, as it may be seen
   from the context; and Paul applies it to Christ, (Romans 9:32.) For in
   him the God of hosts has plainly manifested himself.

   Here, then, the terrible vengeance of God is denounced on all the
   ungodly, because Christ would be to them an offense and a stumbling,
   inasmuch as they refused to make him their foundation. For as the
   firmness and stability of Christ is such that it can sustain all who by
   faith recumb on him; so his hardness is so great that it will break and
   tear in pieces all who resist him. For there is no medium between these
   two things, -- we must either build on him, or be dashed against him.
   [23]

   8 Which stumble at the word He points out here the manner in which
   Christ becomes a stumbling, even when men perversely oppose the word of
   God. This the Jews did; for though they professed themselves willing to
   receive the Messiah, yet they furiously rejected him when presented to
   them by God. The Papists do the same in the present day; they worship
   only the name of Christ, while they cannot endure the doctrine of the
   Gospel. Here Peter intimates that all who receive not Christ as
   revealed in the Gospel, are adversaries to God, and resist his word,
   and also that Christ is to none for destruction, but to those who,
   through headstrong wickedness and obstinacy, rush against the word of
   God.

   And this is especially what deserves to be noticed, lest our fault
   should be imputed to Christ; for, as he has been given to us as a
   foundation, it is as it were an accidental thing that he becomes a rock
   of offense. In short, his proper office is to prepare us for a
   spiritual temple to God; but it is the fault of men that they stumble
   at him, even because unbelief leads men to contend with God. Hence
   Peter, in order to set forth the character of the conflict, said that
   they were the unbelieving.

   Whereunto also they were appointed, or, to which they had been
   ordained. This passage may be explained in two ways. It is, indeed,
   certain that Peter spoke of the Jews; and the common interpretation is,
   that they were appointed to believe, for the promise of salvation was
   destined for them. But the other sense is equally suitable, that they
   had been appointed to unbelief; as Pharaoh is said to have been set up
   for this end, that he might resist God, and all the reprobate are
   destined for the same purpose. And what inclines me to this meaning is
   the particle kai (also) which is put in. [24] If, however, the first
   view be preferred, then it is a vehement upbraiding; for Peter does
   hence enhance the sin of unbelief in the people who had been chosen by
   God, because they rejected the salvation that had been peculiarly
   ordained for them. And no doubt this circumstance rendered them doubly
   inexcusable, that having been called in preference to others, they had
   refused to hear God. But, by saying that they were appointed to
   believe, he refers only to their outward call, even according to the
   covenant which God had made generally with the whole nation. At the
   same time their ingratitude, as it has been said, was sufficiently
   proved, when they rejected the word preached to them.

   [20] Several copies have he graphe instead of en tho graphe; and this
   reading Calvin has followed. But the verb periecho is used by Josephus
   and others in a passive sense. -- Ed.

   [21] The quotation is not exactly either from the Hebrew or from the
   Sept. The Apostle seems to have taken what was suitable to his purpose.
   -- Ed.

   [22] As to this verb he has, but in the previous parts he comes nearer
   to the Hebrew than to the Sept. Paul quotes this sentence twice, Romans
   9:33; 10:11, and follows the Sept. as Peter does. Indeed, the
   difference between ychys he shall make haste, and yvs, he shall be
   ashamed, is very small; and further, the former verb admits of a
   similar meaning with the latter. -- Ed.

   [23] There are in this verse two quotations, one from Psalm 118:22, and
   the other from Isaiah 8:14. That from the Psalms is literally the
   Sept., and is the same as quoted in Matthew 21:42; Mark 12:10; and Luke
   20:17. In all these instances it is lithon, and not lithos according to
   the Hebrew. It is therefore necessary to consider kata as to, or, with
   respect to, as understood, a thing not uncommon in Greek. With regard
   to he time, a noun for an adjective, it refers to the stone, or to him,
   in the preceding verse; but as the metaphor of stone is still continued
   in this verse, it is better to retain it here, "it is precious," that
   is, the stone; and especially as Christ is represented before, in verse
   4, a stone "precious" in the sight of God. -- Ed.

   [24] The most obvious meaning is, to consider the phrase, "who stumble
   at the word," as the antecedent to eis ho "to which:" they being
   disobedient or unbelieving were destined to stumble at the word, and
   thereby to fall and to be broken. (Isaiah 8:14,15.) To the believing it
   was precious, but to the unbelieving it became the stone of stumbling;
   and this stumbling is a judgment to which all the unpersuaded
   (literally) or the unbelieving, are destined. I would render the two
   verses thus, -- "To you then who believe it is precious; but to the
   unbelieving (with regard to the stone which the builders have rejected,
   the same which has become the head of the corner) even a stone of
   stumbling and rock of offense; that is, to those who stumble at the
   word, being unbelieving; to which also they have been appointed:" that
   is, according to the testimony of Scripture. -- Ed.

   1 Peter 2:9-10

   9. But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation,
   a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who
   hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:

   9. Vos autem genus electum, regale sacerdotium, gens sancta, populus in
   acquisitionem, ut virtutes enarretis ejus qui vos ex tenebris vocavit
   in admirabile lumen suum:

   10. Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of
   God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

   10. Qui aliquando non populus, nunc autem populus Dei, qui non
   consequuti eratis misericordiam, nunc misericordiam consequuti estis.


   9 But ye are a chosen generation, or race. He again separates them from
   the unbelieving, lest driven by their example (as it is often the case)
   they should fall away from the faith. As, then, it is unreasonable that
   those whom God has separated from the world, should mix themselves with
   the ungodly, Peter here reminds the faithful to what great honor they
   had been raised, and also to what purpose they had been called. But
   with the same high titles which he confers on them, Moses honored the
   ancient people, (Exodus 19:6;) but the Apostle's object was to shew
   that they had recovered again, through Christ, the great dignity and
   honor from which they had fallen. It is at the same time true, that God
   gave to the fathers an earthly taste only of these blessings, and that
   they are really given in Christ.

   The meaning then is, as though he had said,

   "Moses called formerly your fathers a holy nation, a priestly kingdom,
   and God's peculiar people: all these high titles do now far more justly
   belong to you; therefore you ought to beware lest your unbelief should
   rob you of them." (Exodus 19:6)

   In the meantime, however, as the greater part of the nation was
   unbelieving, the Apostle indirectly sets the believing Jews in
   opposition to all the rest, though they exceeded them in number, as
   though he had said, that those only were the children of Abraham, who
   believed in Christ, and that they only retained possession of all the
   blessings which God had by a singular privilege bestowed on the whole
   nation.

   He calls them a chosen race, because God, passing by others, adopted
   them as it were in a special manner. They were also a holy nation; for
   God had consecrated them to himself, and destined that they should lead
   a pure and holy life. He further calls them a peculiar people, or, a
   people for acquisition, that they might be to him a peculiar possession
   or inheritance; for I take the words simply in this sense, that the
   Lord hath called us, that he might possess us as his own, and devoted
   to him. This meaning is proved by the words of Moses,

   "If ye keep my covenant, ye shall be to me a peculiar treasure beyond
   all other nations." (Exodus 19:5.)

   There is in the royal priesthood a striking inversion of the words of
   Moses; for he says, "a priestly kingdom," but the same thing is meant.
   So what Peter intimated was this, "Moses called your fathers a sacred
   kingdom, because the whole people enjoyed as it were a royal liberty,
   and from their body were chosen the priests; both dignities were
   therefore joined together: but now ye are royal priests, and, indeed,
   in a more excellent way, because ye are, each of you, consecrated in
   Christ, that ye may be the associates of his kingdom, and partakers of
   his priesthood. Though, then, the fathers had something like to what
   you have; yet ye far excel them. For after the wall of partition has
   been pulled down by Christ, we are now gathered from every nation, and
   the Lord bestows these high titles on all whom he makes his people."

   There is further, as to these benefits, a contrast between us and the
   rest of mankind, to be considered: and hence it appears more fully how
   incomparable is God's goodness towards us; for he sanctifies us, who
   are by nature polluted; he chose us, when he could find nothing in us
   but filth and vileness; he makes his peculiar possession from worthless
   dregs; he confers the honor of the priesthood on the profane; he brings
   the vassals of Satan, of sin, and of death, to the enjoyment of royal
   liberty.

   That ye should shew forth, or declare. He carefully points out the end
   of our calling, that he might stimulate us to give the glory to God.
   And the sum of what he says is, that God has favored us with these
   immense benefits and constantly manifests them, that his glory might by
   us be made known: for by praises, or virtues, he understands wisdom,
   goodness, power, righteousness, and everything else, in which the glory
   of God shines forth. And further, it behoves us to declare these
   virtues or excellencies not only by our tongue, but also by our whole
   life. This doctrine ought to be a subject of daily meditation, and it
   ought to be continually remembered by us, that all God's blessings with
   which he favors us are intended for this end, that his glory may be
   proclaimed by us.

   We must also notice what he says, that we have been called out of
   darkness into God's marvellous or wonderful light; for by these words
   he amplifies the greatness of divine grace. If the Lord had given us
   light while we were seeking it, it would have been a favor; but it was
   a much greater favor, to draw us out of the labyrinth of ignorance and
   the abyss of darkness. We ought hence to learn what is man's condition,
   before he is translated into the kingdom of God. And this is what
   Isaiah says,

   "Darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but
   over thee shall the Lord be seen, and his glory shall in thee shine
   forth." (Isaiah 60:2.)

   And truly we cannot be otherwise than sunk in darkness, after having
   departed from God, our only light. See more at large on this subject in
   [6]the second chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians.

   10 Which in time past were not a people He brings for confirmation a
   passage from Hosea, and well accommodates it to his own purpose. For
   Hosea, after having in God's name declared that the Jews were
   repudiated, gives them a hope of a future restoration. Peter reminds us
   that this was fulfilled in his own age; for the Jews were scattered
   here and there, as the torn members of a body; nay, they seemed to be
   no longer God's people, no worship remained among them, they were
   become entangled in the corruptions of the heathens; it could not then
   be said otherwise of them, but that they were repudiated by the Lord.
   But when they are gathered in Christ, from no people they really become
   the people of God. Paul, in Romans 9:26, applies also this prophecy to
   the Gentiles, and not without reason; for from the time the Lord's
   covenant was broken, from which alone the Jews derived their
   superiority, they were put on a level with the Gentiles. It hence
   follows, that what God had promised, to make a people of no people,
   belongs in common to both.

   Which had not obtained mercy This was added by the Prophet, in order
   that the gratuitous covenant of God, by which he takes them to be his
   people, might be more clearly set forth; as though he had said, "There
   is no other reason why the Lord counts us his people, except that he,
   having mercy on us, graciously adopts us." It is then God's gratuitous
   goodness, which makes of no people a people to God, and reconciles the
   alienated. [25]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [25] This verse is a quotation from Hosea 2:23, only the two clauses
   are inverted. The same is quoted by Paul in Romans 9:25, in the same
   inverted form, and with this difference, that Peter follows the Hebrew,
   and Paul the Septuagint. The Hebrew is, "I will have mercy upon her
   that had not obtained mercy;" but according to the Septuagint, "I will
   love her that had not been loved." The meaning is the same, though the
   words are different. -- Ed.

   1 Peter 2:11-12

   11. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
   from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

   11. Amici, adhortor vos tanquam inquilinos et peregrinos, ut
   abstineatis à carnalibus desideriis, que militant adversus animam;

   12. Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas
   they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which
   they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.

   12. Conversationem vestram inter gentes bonam habentes, ut in quo
   detrahunt de vobis tanquam maleficis, ex bonis operibus aestimantes
   (vel, considerantes) glorificent Deum in die visitationis.


   11 As strangers, or sojourners. There are two parts to this
   exhortation, -- that their souls were to be free within from wicked and
   vicious lusts; and also, that they were to live honestly among men, and
   by the example of a good life not only to confirm the godly, but also
   to gain over the unbelieving to God.

   And first, to call them away from the indulgence of carnal lusts, he
   employs this argument, that they were sojourners and strangers. And he
   so calls them, not because they were banished from their country, and
   scattered into various lands, but because the children of God, wherever
   they may be, are only guests in this world. In the former sense,
   indeed, he called them sojourners at the beginning of the Epistle, as
   it appears from the context; but what he says here is common to them
   all. For the lusts of the flesh hold us entangled, when in our minds we
   dwell in the world, and think not that heaven is our country; but when
   we pass as strangers through this life, we are not in bondage to the
   flesh.

   By the lusts or desires of the flesh he means not only those gross
   concupiscences which we have in common with animals, as the Sophists
   hold, but also all those sinful passions and affections of the soul, to
   which we are by nature guided and led. For it is certain that every
   thought of the flesh, that is, of unrenewed nature, is enmity against
   God. (Romans 8:7.)

   Which war against the soul Here is another argument, that they could
   not comply with the desires of the flesh, except to their own ruin. For
   he refers not here to the contest described by Paul in the seventh
   chapter of Romans, and in the fifth of the Galatians, as he makes the
   soul to be an antagonist to the flesh: but what he says here is, that
   the desires of the flesh, whenever the soul consents to them, lead to
   perdition. He proves our carelessness in this respect, that while we
   anxiously shun enemies from whom we apprehend danger to the body, we
   willingly allow enemies hurtful to the soul to destroy us; nay, we as
   it were stretch forth our neck to them.

   12 Your conversation The second part of the exhortation is, that they
   were to conduct themselves honestly towards men. What, indeed, precedes
   this in order is, that their minds should be cleansed before God; but a
   regard should also be had to men, lest we should become a hindrance to
   them. And he expressly says among the Gentiles; for the Jews were not
   only hated everywhere, but were also almost abhorred. The more
   carefully, therefore, ought they to have labored to wipe off the odium
   and infamy attached to their name by a holy life and a well-regulated
   conduct. [26] For that admonition of Paul ought to be attended to, "To
   give no occasion to those who seek occasion." Therefore the evil
   speakings and the wicked insinuations of the ungodly ought to stimulate
   us to lead an upright life; for it is no time for living listlessly and
   securely, when they sharply watch us in order to find out whatever we
   do amiss.

   That they -- may glorify God He intimates that we ought thus to strive,
   not for our own sake, that men may think and speak well of us; but that
   we may glorify God, as Christ also teaches us. And Peter shews how this
   would be effected, even that the unbelieving, led by our good works,
   would become obedient to God, and thus by their own conversion give
   glory to him; for this he intimates by the words, in the day of
   visitation. I know that some refer this to the last coming of Christ;
   but I take it otherwise, even that God employs the holy and honest life
   of his people, as a preparation, to bring back the wandering to the
   right way. For it is the beginning of our conversion, when God is
   pleased to look on us with a paternal eye; but when his face is turned
   away from us, we perish. Hence the day of visitation may justly be said
   to be the time when he invites us to himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [26] Neither "conversation" nor "honest" are suitable words. It is
   difficult to find a proper word in English for anastrope which means
   deportment, behavior, carriage, conduct, manner of live: perhaps life
   would be the best word, "Having your life good among the Gentiles;"
   that is, morally good (kalen) right, or upright. -- Ed.

   1 Peter 2:13-16

   13. Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake:
   whether it be to the king, as supreme;

   13. Subditi ergo estote omni humanae ordinationi propter Dominum; sive
   regi tanquam supereminenti;

   14. Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
   punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.

   14. Sive praesidibus, tanquam iis qui per ipsum mittuntur, in vindictam
   quidem maleficorum, laudem verò benè agentium.

   15. For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
   silence the ignorance of foolish men:

   15. Sic enim est voluntas Dei, ut benefaciendo obstruatis ignorantiam
   stultorum hominum:

   16. As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness,
   but as the servants of God.

   16. Ut liberi, et non quasi praetextum habentes malitiae, libertatem;
   sed tanquam servi Dei.


   13 Submit yourselves He now comes to particular exhortations: and as
   obedience with regard to magistrates is a part of honest or good
   conversation, he draws this inference as to their duty, "Submit
   yourselves," or, Be ye subject; for by refusing the yoke of government,
   they would have given to the Gentiles no small occasion for reproaching
   them. And, indeed, the Jews were especially hated and counted infamous
   for this reason, because they were regarded on account of their
   perverseness as ungovernable. And as the commotions which they raised
   up in the provinces, were causes of great calamities, so that every one
   of a quiet and peaceable disposition dreaded them as the plague, --
   this was the reason that induced Peter to speak so strongly on
   subjection. Besides, many thought the gospel was a proclamation of such
   liberty, that every one might deem himself as free from servitude. It
   seemed an unworthy thing that God's children should be servants, and
   that the heirs of the world should not have a free possession, no, not
   even of their own bodies. Then there was another trial, -- All the
   magistrates were Christ's adversaries; and they used their own
   authority, so that no representation of God, which secures the chief
   reverence, appeared in them. We now perceive the design of Peter: he
   exhorted the Jews, especially for these reasons, to shew respect to the
   civil power.

   To every ordinance of man Some render the words, "to every creature;"
   and from a rendering so obscure and ambiguous, much labor has been
   taken to elicit some meaning. But I have no doubt but that Peter meant
   to point out the distinct manner in which God governs mankind: for the
   verb ktizein in Greek, from which ktisis comes, means to form and to
   construct a building. Suitable, then, is the word "ordination;" by
   which Peter reminds us, that God the maker of the world has not left
   the human race in a state of confusion, that they might live after the
   manner of beasts, but as it were in a building regularly formed, and
   divided into several compartments. And it is called a human ordination,
   not because it has been invented by man, but because a mode of living,
   well arranged and duly ordered, is peculiar to men. [27]

   Whether it be to the king So he calls Caesar, as I think, whose empire
   extended over all those countries mentioned at the beginning of the
   Epistle. For though "king" was a name extremely hated by the Romans,
   yet it was in use among the Greeks. They, indeed, often called him
   autocrat, (autokratora) but sometimes he was also called by them king,
   (basileus.) But as he subjoins a reason, that he ought to be obeyed
   because he excelled, or was eminent or supreme, there is no comparison
   made between Caesar and other magistrates. He held, indeed, the supreme
   power; but that eminence which Peter extols, is common to all who
   exercise public authority. And so Paul, in Romans 13:1, extends it to
   all magistrates. Now the meaning is, that obedience is due to all who
   rule, because they have been raised to that honor not by chance, but by
   God's providence. For many are wont to inquire too scrupulously by what
   right power has been attained; but we ought to be satisfied with this
   alone, that power is possessed and exercised. And so Paul cuts off the
   handle of useless objections when he declares that there is no power
   but from God. And for this reason it is that Scripture so often says,
   that it is God who girds kings with a sword, who raises them on high,
   who transfers kingdoms as he pleases.

   As Peter referred especially to the Roman Emperor, it was necessary to
   add this admonition; for it is certain that the Romans through unjust
   means rather than in a legitimate way penetrated into Asia and subdued
   these countries. Besides, the Caesars, who then reigned, had possessed
   themselves of the monarchy by tyrannical force. Hence Peter as it were
   forbids these things to be controverted, for he shews that subjects
   ought to obey their rulers without hesitation, because they are not
   made eminent, unless elevated by God's hand.

   14 Or unto governors, or, Whether to presidents. He designates every
   kind of magistrates, as though he had said, that there is no kind of
   government to which we ought not to submit. He confirms this by saying
   that they are God's ministers; for they who apply him to the king, are
   greatly mistaken. There is then a common reason, which extols the
   authority of all magistrates, that they rule by the command of God, and
   are sent by him. It hence follows (as Paul also teaches us) that they
   resist God, who do not obediently submit to a power ordained by him.

   For the punishment This is the second reason why it behoves us
   reverently to regard and to respect civil authority, and that is,
   because it has been appointed by the Lord for the common good of
   mankind; for we must be extremely barbarous and brutal, if the public
   good is not regarded by us. This, then, in short, is what Peter means,
   that since God keeps the world in order by the ministry of magistrates,
   all they who despise their authority are enemies to mankind.

   Now he assumes these two things, which belong, as Plato says, to a
   commonwealth, that is, reward to the good and punishment to the wicked;
   for, in ancient times, not only punishment was allotted to evil-doers,
   but also rewards to the doers of good. But though it often happens that
   honors are not rightly distributed, nor rewards given to the deserving,
   yet it is an honor, not to be despised, that the good are at the least
   under the care and protection of magistrates, that they are not exposed
   to the violence and injuries of the ungodly, that they live more
   quietly under laws and better retain their reputation, than if every
   one, unrestrained, lived as he pleased. In short, it is a singular
   blessing of God, that the wicked are not allowed to do what they like.

   It may, however, be objected here and said, that kings and magistrates
   often abuse their power, and exercise tyrannical cruelty rather than
   justice. Such were almost all the magistrates, when this Epistle was
   written. To this I answer, that tyrants and those like them, do not
   produce such effects by their abuse, but that the ordinance of God ever
   remains in force, as the institution of marriage is not subverted
   though the wife and the husband were to act in a way not becoming them.
   However, therefore, men may go astray, yet the end fixed by God cannot
   be changed.

   Were any one again to object and say, that we ought not to obey princes
   who, as far as they can, pervert the holy ordinance of God, and thus
   become savage wild beasts, while magistrates ought to bear the image of
   God. My reply is this, that government established by God ought to be
   so highly valued by us, as to honor even tyrants when in power. There
   is yet another reply still more evident, -- that there has never been a
   tyranny, (nor can one be imagined,) however cruel and unbridled, in
   which some portion of equity has not appeared; and further, some kind
   of government, however deformed and corrupt it may be, is still better
   and more beneficial than anarchy.

   15 For so is the will of God He returns to his former doctrine, lest an
   occasion should be given to the unbelieving to speak evil, though he
   expresses less than what he had said before; for he says only that the
   mouths of the foolish ought to be stopped. The phrase which he adopts,
   "to stop up ignorance," though it may seem harsh on account of its
   novelty, does not yet obscure the sense. [28] For he not only calls the
   unbelieving foolish, but also points out the reason why they slandered,
   even because they were ignorant of God. But inasmuch as he makes the
   unbelieving to be without understanding and reason, we hence conclude,
   that a right understanding cannot exist without the knowledge of God.
   How much soever, then, the unbelieving may boast of their own
   acuteness, and may seem to themselves to be wise and prudent, yet the
   Spirit of God charges them with folly, in order that we may know that,
   apart from God, we cannot be really wise, as without him there is
   nothing perfect.

   But he prescribes the way in which the evil-speaking of the unbelieving
   is to be restrained, even by well-doing, or, by doing good. In this
   expression he includes all the duties of humanity and kindness which we
   ought to perform towards our neighbors. And in these is included
   obedience to magistrates, without which concord among men cannot be
   cultivated. Were any one to object and say, that the faithful can never
   be so careful to do good, but that they will be evil-spoken of by the
   unbelieving: to this the obvious answer is, that the Apostle here does
   not in any degree exempt them from calumnies and reproaches; but he
   means that no occasion of slandering ought to be given to the
   unbelieving, however much they may desire it. And lest any one should
   further object and say, that the unbelieving are by no means worthy of
   so much regard that God's children should form their life to please
   them, Peter expressly reminds us that we are bound by God's command to
   shut up their mouths.

   16 As free This is said by way of anticipation, that he might obviate
   those things which are usually objected to with regard to the liberty
   of God's children. For as men are naturally ingenious in laying hold on
   what may be for their advantage, many, at the commencement of the
   Gospel, thought themselves free to live only for themselves. This
   doting opinion, then, is what Peter corrects; and he briefly shews how
   much the liberty of Christians differed from unbridled licentiousness.
   And, in the first place, he denies that there is any veil or pretext
   for wickedness, by which he intimates, that there is no liberty given
   us to hurt our neighbors, or to do any harm to others. True liberty,
   then, is that which harms or injures no one. To confirm this, he
   declares that those are free who serve God. It is obvious, hence, to
   conclude, that we obtain liberty, in order that we may more promptly
   and more readily render obedience to God; for it is no other than a
   freedom from sin; and dominion is taken away from sin, that men may
   become obedient to righteousness.

   In short, it is a free servitude, and a serving freedom. For as we
   ought to be the servants of God, that we may enjoy this benefit, so
   moderation is required in the use of it. In this way, indeed, our
   consciences become free; but this prevents us not to serve God, who
   requires us also to be subject to men.

   [27] The words literally are, "Submit ye to every human creation:" but,
   as Calvin says, the Greek verb means sometimes to form, to construct;
   and so does vr' to create, in Hebrew. The noun may hence be rendered
   "institution," what is formed. As in the second verse, so here, the
   Apostle, in a way almost peculiar to himself, and the reverse of what
   is commonly done in Scripture, uses an adjective for a noun, "human"
   for "of man;" and he does the same in 1 Peter 3:7, "the womanish weaker
   vessel," instead of "the woman (or wife) the weaker vessel." We may
   then render the words, "Submit ye to every institution of man." The
   reference is clearly to government. The ostensible agent in the
   formation of all governments is man; but God is the overruler of all
   things. -- Ed.

   [28] The word properly means to muzzle; "that ye, by doing good, should
   muzzle the ignorance of foolish men;" according to what is done to
   savage animals, in order to prevent them to do harm. -- Ed.

   1 Peter 2:17

   17. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.

   17. Omnes honorate, fraternitatem diligite, Deum timete, regem
   honorate.


   This is a summary of what is gone before; for he intimates that God is
   not feared, nor their just right rendered to men, except civil order
   prevails among us, and magistrates retain their authority. That he bids
   honor to be rendered to all, I explain thus, that none are to be
   neglected; for it is a general precept, which refers to the social
   intercourse of men. [29] The word honor has a wide meaning in Hebrew,
   and we know that the apostles, though they wrote in Greek, followed the
   meaning of words in the former language. Therefore, this word conveys
   no other idea to me, than that a regard ought to be had for all, since
   we ought to cultivate, as far as we can, peace and friendship with all;
   there is, indeed, nothing more adverse to concord than contempt.

   What he adds respecting the love of brethren is special, as contrasted
   with the first clause; for he speaks of that particular love which we
   are bidden to have towards the household of faith, because we are
   connected with them by a closer relationship. And so Peter did not omit
   this connection; but yet he reminds us, that though brethren are to be
   specially regarded, yet this ought not to prevent our love from being
   extended to the whole human race. The word fraternity, or brotherhood,
   I take collectively for brethren.

   Fear God I have already said that all these clauses are applied by
   Peter to the subject he was treating. For he means, that honor paid to
   kings proceeds from the fear of God and the love of man; and that,
   therefore, it ought to be connected with them, as though he had said,
   "Whosoever fears God, loves his brethren and the whole human race as he
   ought, and will also give honor to kings." But, at the same time, he
   expressly mentions the king, because that form of government was more
   than any other disliked; and under it other forms are included.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [29] It is better to take it in this wide sense, than to limit it, as
   some have done, to rulers or magistrates, because honor to magistrates
   is included in the last clause, "Honour the king." -- Ed.

   1 Peter 2:18-20

   18. Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the
   good and gentle, but also to the froward.

   18. Famuli, subjecti sint cum omni timore dominis suis, non solum bonis
   et humanis, sed etiam pravis.

   19. For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience towards God endure
   grief, suffering wrongfully.

   19. Haec enim est gratia, si propter conscientiam Dei quispiam
   molestias ferat patiens injustè.

   20. For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
   shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye
   take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.

   20. Qualis enim gloria, si quum peccantes alapis caedemini, suffertis?
   sed si bene facientes et in aliis affecti suffertis, haec gratia apud
   Deum.


   18 Servants, be subject Though this is a particular admonition, yet it
   is connected with what is gone before, as well as the other things
   which follow; for the obedience of servants to masters, and of wives
   also to their husbands, forms a part of civil or social subjection.
   [30]

   He first would have servants to be subject with all fear; by which
   expression he means that sincere and willing reverence, which they
   acknowledge by their office to be due. He then sets this fear in
   opposition to dissimulation as well as to forced subjection; for an
   eye-service (ophthalmodouleia, Colossians 3:22,) as Paul calls it, is
   the opposite of this fear; and further, if servants clamor against
   severe treatment, being ready to throw off the yoke if they could, they
   cannot be said properly to fear. In short, fear arises from a right
   knowledge of duty. And though no exception is added in this place, yet,
   according to other places, it is to be understood. For subjection due
   to men is not to be so far extended as to lessen the authority of God.
   Then servants are to be subject to their masters, only as far as God
   permits, or as far as the altars, as they say. But as the word here is
   not douloi, slaves, but oiketai, domestics, we may understand the free
   as well as the bond servants to be meant, though it be a difference of
   little moment.

   Not only to the good Though as to the duty of servants to obey their
   masters, it is wholly a matter of conscience; if, however, they are
   unjustly treated, as to themselves, they ought not to resist authority.
   Whatever, then, masters may be, there is no excuse for servants for not
   faithfully obeying them. For when a superior abuses his power, he must
   indeed hereafter render an account to God, yet he does not for the
   present lose his right. For this law is laid on servants, that they are
   to serve their masters, though they may be unworthy. For the froward he
   sets in opposition to the equitable or humane; and by this word he
   refers to the cruel and the perverse, or those who have no humanity and
   kindness. [31]

   It is a wonder what could have induced an interpreter to change one
   Greek word for another, and render it "wayward." I should say nothing
   of the gross ignorance of the Sorbons, who commonly understand by
   wayward, (dyscolos,) the dissolute or dissipated, were it not that they
   seek by this absurd rendering to build up for us an article of faith,
   that we ought to obey the Pope and his horned wild beasts, however
   grievous and intolerable a tyranny they may exercise. This passage,
   then, shews how boldly they trifle with the Word of God.

   19 For this is thankworthy The word grace or favor, has the meaning of
   praise; for he means that no grace or praise shall be found before God,
   if we bear the punishment which we have by our faults deserved; but
   that they who patiently bear injuries and wrongs are worthy of praise
   and accepted by God. [32] To testify that it was acceptable to God,
   when any one from conscience towards God persevered in doing his duty,
   though unjustly and unworthily treated, was at that time very
   necessary; for the condition of servants was very hard: they were
   counted no better than cattle. Such indignity might have driven them to
   despair; the only thing left for them was to look to God.

   For conscience towards God means this, that one performs his duty, not
   from a regard to men, but to God. For, when a wife is submissive and
   obedient to her husband, in order to please him, she has her reward in
   this world, as Christ says of the ambitious, who looked to the praise
   of men, (Matthew 6:16.) The same view is to be taken of other cases:
   When a son obeys his father in order to secure his favor and bounty, he
   will have his reward from his father, not from God. It is, in short, a
   general truth, that what we do is approved by God, if our object be to
   serve him, and if we are not influenced by a regard to man alone.
   Moreover, he who considers that he has to do with God, must necessarily
   endeavor to overcome evil with good. For, God not only requires that we
   should be such to every one as he is to us, but also that we should be
   good to the unworthy and to such as persecute us.

   It is not, however, an assertion without its difficulty, when he says,
   that there is nothing praiseworthy in him who is justly punished; for,
   when the Lord punishes our sins, patience is certainly a sacrifice of
   sweet odour to him, that is, when we bear with a submissive mind our
   punishment. But to this I reply, that Peter does not here speak simply
   but comparatively; for it is a small and slender praise to bear with
   submission a just punishment, in comparison with that of an innocent
   man, who willingly bears the wrongs of men, only because he fears God.
   At the same time he seems indirectly to refer to the motive; because
   they who suffer punishment for their faults, are influenced by the fear
   of men. But the reply already given is sufficient.

   1 Peter 2:21-23

   21. For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for
   us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:

   21. In hoc enim vocati estis; quoniam Christus quoque passus est pro
   vobis, relinquens vobis exemplum, ut sequeremini vestigia ejus:

   22. Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:

   22. Qui quum peccatum non fecisset, nec inventus esset dolus in ore
   ejus;

   23. Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he
   threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:

   23. Quum probro afficeretur, non regerebat; quum pateretur, non
   comminabatur; causam vero commendabat ei qui juste judicat.


   21 For even hereunto were ye called For though his discourse was
   respecting servants, yet this passage ought not to be confined to that
   subject. For the Apostle here reminds all the godly in common as to
   what the condition of Christianity is, as though he had said, that we
   are called by the Lord for this end, patiently to bear wrongs; and as
   he says in another place that we are appointed to this. Lest, however,
   this should seem grievous to us, he consoles us with the example of
   Christ. Nothing seems more unworthy, and therefore less tolerable, than
   undeservedly to suffer; but when we turn our eyes to the Son of God,
   this bitterness is mitigated; for who would refuse to follow him going
   before us?

   But we must notice the words, Leaving us an example [33] For as he
   treats of imitation, it is necessary to know what in Christ is to be
   our example. He walked on the sea, he cleansed the leprous, he raised
   the dead, he restored sight to the blind: to try to imitate him in
   these things would be absurd. For when he gave these evidences of his
   power, it was not his object that we should thus imitate him. It has
   hence happened that his fasting for forty days has been made without
   reason an example; but what he had in view was far otherwise. We ought,
   therefore, to exercise in this respect a right judgment; as also
   Augustine somewhere reminds us, when explaining the following passage,

   "Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart."
   (Matthew 11:29.)

   And the same thing may be learnt from the words of Peter; for he marks
   the difference by saying that Christ's patience is what we ought to
   follow. This subject is handled more at large by Paul in Romans 8:29,
   where he teaches us that all the children of God are foreordained to be
   made conformable to the image of Christ, in order that he might be the
   first-born among many brethren. Hence, that we may live with him, we
   must previously die with him.

   22 Who did no sin This belongs to the present subject; for, if any one
   boasts of his own innocence, he must know that Christ did not suffer as
   a malefactor. He, at the same time, shews how far we come short of what
   Christ was, when he says, that there was no guile found in his mouth;
   for he who offends not by his tongue, says James, is a perfect man.
   (James 3:2.) He then declares that there was in Christ the highest
   perfection of innocency, such as no one of us can dare claim for
   himself. It hence appears more fully how unjustly he suffered beyond
   all others. There is, therefore, no reason why any one of us should
   refuse to suffer after his example, since no one is so conscious of
   having acted rightly, as not to know that he is imperfect.

   23 When he was reviled, or, reproached. Here Peter points out what we
   are to imitate in Christ, even calmly to bear wrongs, and not to avenge
   wrongs. For such is our disposition, that when we receive injuries, our
   minds immediately boil over with revengeful feelings; but Christ
   abstained from every kind of retaliation. Our minds, therefore, ought
   to be bridled, lest we should seek to render evil for evil.

   But committed himself, or, his cause. The word cause is not expressed,
   but it is obviously understood. And Peter adds this for the consolation
   of the godly, that is, that if they patiently endured the reproaches
   and violence of the wicked, they would have God as their defender. For
   it would be a very hard thing for us, to be subjected to the will of
   the ungodly, and not to have God caring for our wrongs. Peter,
   therefore, adorns God with this high attribute, that he judgeth
   righteously, as though he had said, "It behoves us calmly to bear
   evils; God in the meantime will not neglect what belongs to him, but
   will shew himself to be a righteous judge." However wanton then the
   ungodly may be for a time, yet they shall not be unpunished for the
   wrongs done now to the children of God. Nor is there any cause for the
   godly to fear, as though they were without any protection; for since it
   belongs to God to defend them and to undertake their cause, they are to
   possess their souls in patience.

   Moreover, as this doctrine brings no small consolation, so it avails to
   allay and subdue the inclinations of the flesh. For no one can recumb
   on the fidelity and protection of God, but he who in a meek spirit
   waits for his judgment; for he who leaps to take vengeance, intrudes
   into what belongs to God, and suffers not God to perform his own
   office. In reference to this Paul says, "Give place to wrath," (Romans
   12:19;) and thus he intimates that the way is closed up against God
   that he might not himself judge, when we anticipate him. He then
   confirms what he had said by the testimony of Moses, "Vengeance is
   mine." (Deuteronomy 32:35.) Peter in short meant this, that we after
   the example of Christ shall be more prepared to endure injuries, if we
   give to God his own honor, that is, if we, believing him to be a
   righteous judge, refer our right and our cause to him.

   It may however be asked, How did Christ commit his cause to the Father;
   for if he required vengeance from him, this he himself says is not
   lawful for us; for he bids us to do good to those who injure us, to
   pray for those who speak evil of us. (Matthew 5:44.) To this my reply
   is, that it appears evident from the gospel-history, that Christ did
   thus refer his judgment to God, and yet did not demand vengeance to be
   taken on his enemies, but that, on the contrary, he prayed for them,
   "Father," he said, "forgive them." (Luke 23:34.) And doubtless the
   feelings of our flesh are far from being in unison with the judgment of
   God. That any one then may commit his cause to him who judgeth
   righteously, it is necessary that he should first lay a check on
   himself, so that he may not ask anything inconsistent with the
   righteous judgment of God. For they who indulge themselves in looking
   for vengeance, concede not to God his office of a judge, but in a
   manner wish him to be an executioner. He then who is so calm in his
   spirit as to wish his adversaries to become his friends, and endeavors
   to bring them to the right way, rightly commits to God his own cause,
   and his prayer is, "Thou, O Lord, knowest my heart, how I wish them to
   be saved who seek to destroy me: were they converted, I should
   congratulate them; but if they continue obstinate in their wickedness,
   for I know that thou watchest over my safety, I commit my cause to
   thee." This meekness was manifested by Christ; it is then the rule to
   be observed by us.

   1 Peter 2:24-25

   24. Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that
   we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose
   stripes ye were healed.

   24. Qui peccata nostra ipse pertulit in corpore suo super lignum, ut
   peccatis mortui, justitiae vivamus: cujus livori sanati estis.

   25. For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the
   Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

   25. Eratis enim tanquam oves errantes; sed conversi estis nunc ad
   Pastorem et Episcopum animarum vestrarum.


   Had he commended nothing in Christ's death except as an example, it
   would have been very frigid: he therefore refers to a fruit much more
   excellent. There are then three things to be noticed in this passage.
   The first is, that Christ by his death has given us an example of
   patience; the second, that by his death he restored us to life; it
   hence follows, that we are so bound to him, that we ought cheerfully to
   follow his example. In the third place, he refers to the general design
   of his death, that we, being dead to sins, ought to live to
   righteousness. And all these things confirm his previous exhortation.

   24 Who his own self bare our sins This form of speaking is fitted to
   set forth the efficacy of Christ's death. For as under the Law, the
   sinner, that he might be released from guilt, substituted a victim in
   his own place; so Christ took on himself the curse due to our sins,
   that he might atone for them before God. And he expressly adds, on the
   tree, because he could not offer such an expiation except on the cross.
   Peter, therefore, well expresses the truth, that Christ's death was a
   sacrifice for the expiation of our sins; for being fixed to the cross
   and offering himself a victim for us, he took on himself our sin and
   our punishment. Isaiah, from whom Peter has taken the substance of his
   doctrine, employs various forms of expression, -- that he was smitten
   by God's hand for our sins, that he was wounded for our iniquities,
   that he was afflicted and broken for our sake, that the chastisement of
   our peace was laid on him. But Peter intended to set forth the same
   thing by the words of this verse, even that we are reconciled to God on
   this condition, because Christ made himself before his tribunal a
   surety and as one guilty for us, that he might suffer the punishment
   due to us.

   This great benefit the Sophists in their schools obscure as much as
   they can; for they prattle that by the sacrifice of the death of Christ
   we are only freed after baptism from guilt, but that punishment is
   redeemed by satisfactions. But Peter, when he says that he bore our
   sins, means that not only guilt was imputed to him, but that he also
   suffered its punishment, that he might thus be an expiatory victim,
   according to that saying of the Prophet, "The chastisement of our peace
   was upon him." If they object and say, that this only avails before
   baptism, the context here disproves them, for the words are addressed
   to the faithful.

   But this clause and that which follows, by whose stripes ye were
   healed, may be also applied to the subject in hand, that is, that it
   behoves us to bear on our shoulders the sins of others, not indeed to
   expiate for them, but only to bear them as a burden laid on us.

   Being dead to sins [34] He had before pointed out another end, even an
   example of patience; but here, as it has been stated, it is made more
   manifest, that we are to live a holy and righteous life. The Scripture
   sometimes mentions both, that is, that the Lord tries us with troubles
   and adversities, that we might be conformed to the death of Christ, and
   also that the old man has been crucified in the death of Christ, that
   we might walk in newness of life. (Philippians 3:10; Romans 6:4.) At
   the same time, this end of which he speaks, differs from the former,
   not only as that which is general from what is particular; for in
   patience there is simply an example; but when he says that Christ
   suffered, that we being dead to sins should live to righteousness, he
   intimates that there is power in Christ's death to mortify our flesh,
   as Paul explains more fully in the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the
   Romans. For he has not only brought this great benefit to us, that God
   justifies us freely, by not imputing to us our sins; but he also makes
   us to die to the world and to the flesh, that we may rise again to a
   new life: not that one day makes complete this death; but wherever it
   is, the death of Christ is efficacious for the expiation of sins, and
   also for the mortification of the flesh.

   25 For ye were as sheep This also has Peter borrowed from Isaiah,
   except that the Prophet makes it a universal statement,

   "All we like sheep have gone astray." (Isaiah 53:6.)

   But on the word sheep there is no particular stress; he indeed compares
   us to sheep, but the emphasis is on what the Prophet adds, when he says
   that every one had turned to his own way. The meaning then is, that we
   are all going astray from the way of salvation, and proceeding in the
   way of ruin, until Christ brings us back from this wandering.

   And this appears still more evident from the clause which follows, but
   are now returned to the Shepherd, etc.; [35] for all who are not ruled
   by Christ, are wandering like lost sheep in the ways of error. Thus,
   then, is condemned the whole wisdom of the world, which does not submit
   to the government of Christ. But the two titles given here to Christ
   are remarkable, that he is the Shepherd and Bishop of souls There is
   then no cause to fear, but that he will faithfully watch over the
   safety of those who are in his fold and under his care. And it is his
   office to keep us safe both in body and soul; yet Peter mentions only
   souls, because this celestial Shepherd keeps us under his own spiritual
   protection unto eternal life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [34] Or, "Being freed from sins:" apogenomenoi, being away from, having
   departed from, or, being removed from. Beza renders it "being separated
   from." Freedom from the power or dominion of sin seems more expressly
   to be intended, as the end of this freedom is, that we may live to
   righteousness; the end of forgiveness on the other hand is, that we may
   have peace with God. Beza, Estius, Grotis, and Scott, take this view of
   the sentence. The subject in hand is not the removal of guilt, but
   holiness of life, and Christ in his sufferings is set forth as the
   pattern to us. Then in what follows, our diseased state and our
   wandering from the right way, are the things referred to. Christ's
   death was intended to answer two great ends, -- to remove guilt and to
   remove or to destroy sin in us. The latter is the subject of this
   passage. -- Ed.

   [35] I would render the clause thus, "But you have been now restored,"
   that is, from your wandering, "to the shepherd and the bishop (or,
   overseer) of your souls." Macknight thinks, that our Lord took the
   title of shepherd in order to shew that he is the person foretold in
   Ezekiel 34:23, and that Peter alludes, in calling him bishop or
   overseer, to the eleventh verse of that chapter, the latter clause of
   which, according to the Sept. is, "I will oversee them,"
   (episkepsomai.) -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Peter 3:1-4

   1. Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if
   any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the
   conversation of the wives;

   1. Similiter mulieres subjectae sint propriis maritis; ut etiam siqui
   sunt increduli sermoni, per uxorum conversationem absque sermone
   lucrifiant;

   2. While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.

   2. Considerantes puram (vel, castam) vestram in timore conversationem;

   3. Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the
   hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;

   3. Quarum ornatus sit non externus, in plicatura capillorum et
   circumpositione auri, aut palliorum amictu;

   4. But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
   corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in
   the sight of God of great price.

   4. Sed interior cordis homo, qui in incorruptione situs est placidi et
   quieti spiritus, qui spiritus coram Deo pretiosus est (vel, quod est
   coram Deo pretiosum.)


   He proceeds now to another instance of subjection, and bids wives to be
   subject to their husbands. And as those seemed to have some pretense
   for shaking off the yoke, who were united to unbelieving men, he
   expressly reminds them of their duty, and brings forward a particular
   reason why they ought the more carefully to obey, even that they might
   by their probity allure their husbands to the faith. But if wives ought
   to obey ungodly husbands, with much more promptness ought they to obey,
   who have believing husbands.

   But it may seem strange that Peter should say, that a husband might be
   gained to the Lord without the word; for why is it said, that "faith
   cometh by hearing?" Romans 10:17. To this I reply, that Peter's words
   are not to be so understood as though a holy life alone could lead the
   unbelieving to Christ, but that it softens and pacifies their minds, so
   that they might have less dislike to religion; for as bad examples
   create offenses, so good ones afford no small help. Then Peter shews
   that wives by a holy and pious life could do so much as to prepare
   their husbands, without speaking to them on religion, to embrace the
   faith of Christ.

   2 While they behold For minds, however alienated from the true faith,
   are subdued, when they see the good conduct of believers; for as they
   understood not the doctrine of Christ, they form an estimate of it by
   our life. It cannot, then, be but that they will commend Christianity,
   which teaches purity and fear.

   3 Whose adorning The other part of the exhortation is, that wives are
   to adorn themselves sparingly and modestly: for we know that they are
   in this respect much more curious and ambitious than they ought to be.
   Then Peter does not without cause seek to correct in them this vanity.
   And though he reproves generally sumptuous or costly adorning, yet he
   points out some things in particular, -- that they were not
   artificially to curl or wreath their hair, as it was usually done by
   crisping-pins, or otherwise to form it according to the fashion; nor
   were they to set gold around their head: for these are the things in
   which excesses especially appear.

   It may be now asked, whether the Apostle wholly condemns the use of
   gold in adorning the body. Were any one to urge these words, it may be
   said, that he prohibits precious garments no less than gold; for he
   immediately adds, the putting on of apparel, or, of clothes. But it
   would be an immoderate strictness wholly to forbid neatness and
   elegance in clothing. If the material is said to be too sumptuous, the
   Lord has created it; and we know that skill in art has proceeded from
   him. Then Peter did not intend to condemn every sort of ornament, but
   the evil of vanity, to which women are subject. Two things are to be
   regarded in clothing, usefulness and decency; and what decency requires
   is moderation and modesty. Were, then, a woman to go forth with her
   hair wantonly curled and decked, and make an extravagant display, her
   vanity could not be excused. They who object and say, that to clothe
   one's-self in this or that manner is an indifferent thing, in which all
   are free to do as they please, may be easily confuted; for excessive
   elegance and superfluous display, in short, all excesses, arise from a
   corrupted mind. Besides, ambition, pride, affectation of display, and
   all things of this kind, are not indifferent things. Therefore they
   whose minds are purified from all vanity, will duly order all things,
   so as not to exceed moderation.

   4 But let it be the hidden, man of the heart The contrast here ought to
   be carefully observed. Cato said, that they who are anxiously engaged
   in adorning the body, neglect the adorning of the mind: so Peter, in
   order to restrain this desire in women, introduces a remedy, that they
   are to devote themselves to the cultivation of their minds. The word
   heart, no doubt means the whole soul. He at the same time shews in what
   consists the spiritual adorning of women, even in the incorruptness of
   a meek and quiet spirit "Incorruptness," as I think, is set in
   opposition to things which fade and vanish away, things which serve to
   adorn the body. Therefore the version of Erasmus departs from the real
   meaning. In short, Peter means that the ornament of the soul is not
   like a fading flower, nor consists in vanishing splendor, but is
   incorruptible. By mentioning quiet and a tranquil spirit, he marks out
   what especially belongs to women; for nothing becomes them more than a
   placid and a sedate temper of mind. [36] For we know how outrageous a
   being is an imperious and a self-willed woman. And further, nothing is
   more fitted to correct the vanity of which Peter speaks than a placid
   quietness of spirit.

   What follows, that it is in the sight of God of great price, may be
   referred to the whole previous sentence as well as to the word spirit;
   the meaning indeed will remain the same. For why do women take so much
   care to adorn themselves, except that they may turn the eyes of men on
   themselves? But Peter, on the contrary, bids them to be more anxious
   for what is before God of a great price.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [36] The best construction is to regard "adorning," or ornament, as
   understood after "incorruptible:" "But the hidden man of the heart,
   clothed in (or with) the incorruptible adorning of a mild and quiet
   spirit." "Mild" or meek, not given to passion or wrath, patient, not
   proud nor arrogant; quiet, peaceable, not garrulous, not turbulent, nor
   given to strife and contention. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Peter 3:5-6

   5. For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
   trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own
   husbands:

   5. Sic enim aliquando et sanctae mulieres quae sperabant in Deum,
   ornabant seipsas, subjectae propriis maritis:

   6. Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye
   are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.

   6. Quemadmodum et Sara obediebat Abrahae, dominum ipsum appellans,
   cujus filiae estis factae, si benefeceritis, et non terreamini ullo
   pavore.


   He sets before them the example of pious women, who sought for
   spiritual adorning rather than outward meretricious ornaments. But he
   mentions Sarah above all others, who, having been the mother of all the
   faithful, is especially worthy of honor and imitation on the part of
   her sex. Moreover, he returns again to subjection, and confirms it by
   the example of Sarah, who, according to the words of Moses, called her
   husband Lord. (Genesis 18:12.) God, indeed, does not regard such
   titles; and it may sometimes be, that one especially petulant and
   disobedient should use such a word with her tongue; but Peter means,
   that Sarah usually spoke thus, because she knew that a command had been
   given her by the Lord, to be subject to her husband. Peter adds, that
   they who imitated her fidelity would be her daughters, that is,
   reckoned among the faithful.

   6 And are not afraid The weakness of the sex causes women to be
   suspicious and timid, and therefore morose; for they fear lest by their
   subjection, they should be more reproachfully treated. It was this that
   Peter seems to have had in view in forbidding them to be disturbed by
   any fear, as though he had said, "Willingly submit to the authority of
   your husbands, nor let fear prevent your obedience, as though your
   condition would be worse, were you to obey." The words may be more
   general, "Let them not raise up commotions at home." For as they are
   liable to be frightened, they often make much of a little thing, and
   thus disturb themselves and the family. Others think that the timidity
   of women, which is contrary to faith, is generally reproved, as though
   Peter exhorted them to perform the duties of their calling with a
   courageous and intrepid spirit. However, the first explanation is what
   I prefer, though the last does not differ much from it. [37]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [37] The words are, "Whose daughters ye become, when ye do well and
   fear no terror." Terror here stands for what terrifies. The paraphrase
   of Macknight seems to give the real and simple meaning of the passage,
   "Whose daughters ye Christian women have become, by behaving well
   towards your husbands, and not being frightened to actions contrary to
   your religion through fear of displeasing them."
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Peter 3:7

   7. Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
   giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being
   heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.

   7. Viri similiter cohabitent secundum scientiam, tanquam infirmiori
   vasi, muliebri impertientes honorem, tanquam etiam cohaeredes gratiae
   vitae (vel, multiplicis gratiae et vitae,) ne preces vestrae
   interrumpantur.


   7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them. From husbands he requires
   prudence; for dominion over their wives is not given them, except on
   this condition, that they exercise authority prudently. Then let
   husbands remember that they need prudence to do rightly their duty. And
   doubtless many foolish things must be endured by them, many unpleasant
   things must be borne with; and they must at the same time beware lest
   their indulgence should foster folly. Hence the admonition of Peter is
   not in vain, that the husbands ought to cohabit with them as with a
   weaker vessel. Part of the prudence which he mentions, is, that the
   husbands honor their wives. For nothing destroys the friendship of life
   more than contempt; nor can we really love any but those whom we
   esteem; for love must be connected with respect.

   Moreover, he employs a twofold argument, in order to persuade husbands
   to treat their wives honourably and kindly. The first is derived from
   the weakness of the sex; the other, from the honor with which God
   favors them. These things seem indeed to be in a manner contrary, --
   that honor ought to be given to wives, because they are weak, and
   because they excel; but these things well agree together where love
   exists. It is evident, that God is despised in his gifts, except we
   honor those on whom he has conferred any excellency. But when we
   consider that we are members of the same body, we learn to bear with
   one another, and mutually to cover our infirmities. This is what Paul
   means when he says that greater honor is given to the weaker members,
   (1 Corinthians 12:23;) even because we are more careful in protecting
   them from shame. Then Peter does not without reason command that women
   should be cared for, and that they should be honored with a kind
   treatment, because they are weak. And then as we more easily forgive
   children, when they offend through inexperience of age; so the weakness
   of the female sex ought to make us not to be too rigid and severe
   towards our wives.

   The word vessel, as it is well known, means in Scripture any sort of
   instrument.

   Being heirs together (or co-heirs) of the grace of life Some copies
   have "of manifold grace;" others, instead of "life," have the word
   "living." Some read "co-heirs" in the dative case, which makes no
   difference in the sense. A conjunction is put by others between
   manifold grace and life; which reading is the most suitable. [38] For
   since the Lord is pleased to bestow in common on husbands and wives the
   same graces, he invites them to seek an equality in them; and we know
   that those graces are manifold in which wives are partakers with their
   husbands. For some belong to the present life, and some to God's
   spiritual kingdom. He afterwards adds, that they are co-heirs also of
   life, which is the chief thing. And though some are strangers to the
   hope of salvation, yet as it is offered by the Lord to them no less
   than to their husbands, it is a sufficient honor to the sex.

   That your prayers be not hindered For God cannot be rightly called
   upon, unless our minds be calm and peaceable. Among strifes and
   contentions there is no place for prayer. Peter indeed addresses the
   husband and the wife, when he bids them to be at peace one with
   another, so that they might with one mind pray to God. But we may hence
   gather a general doctrine -- that no one ought to come to God except he
   is united to his brethren. Then as this reason ought to restrain all
   domestic quarrels and strifes, in order that each one of the family may
   pray to God; so in common life it ought to be as it were a bridle to
   check all contentions. For we are more than insane, if we knowingly and
   wilfully close up the way to God's presence by prayer, since this is
   the only asylum of our salvation.

   Some give this explanation, that an intercourse with the wife ought to
   be sparing and temperate, lest too much indulgence in this respect
   should prevent attention to prayer, according to that saying of Paul,

   "Defraud not one another, unless by consent for a time, that ye may
   give yourselves to fasting and prayer." (1 Corinthians 7:5.)

   But the doctrine of Peter extends wider: and then Paul does not mean
   that prayers are interrupted by mutual cohabitation. Therefore the
   explanation which I have given ought to be retained.

   1 Peter 3:8-9

   8. Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another;
   love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:

   8. Denique sitis omnes idem sentientes, compatientes, fraternè vos
   diligentes, misericordes, humiles;

   9. Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but
   contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye
   should inherit a blessing.

   9. Non reddentes malum pro malo, vel convitium pro convitio; imo potius
   benedicentes, scientes quod in hoc vocati sitis, ut benedictionem
   hereditate consequamini.


   Now follow general precepts which indiscriminately belong to all. [39]
   Moreover he summarily mentions some things which are especially
   necessary to foster friendship and love. The first is, Be ye all of one
   mind, or, think ye all the same thing. For though friends are at
   liberty to think differently, yet to do so is a cloud which obscures
   love; yea, from this seed easily arises hatred. Sympathy (sumpatheia)
   extends to all our faculties, when concord exists between us; so that
   every one condoles with us in adversity as well as rejoices with us in
   prosperity, so that every one not only cares for himself, but also
   regards the benefit of others.

   What next follows, Love as brethren, belongs peculiarly to the
   faithful; for where God is known as a Father, there only brotherhood
   really exists. Be pitiful, or merciful, which is added, means that we
   are not only to help our brethren and relieve their miseries, but also
   to bear with their infirmities. In what follows there are two readings
   in Greek; but what seems to me the most probable is the one I have put
   as the text; for we know that it is the chief bond to preserve
   friendship, when every one thinks modestly and humbly of himself; as
   there is nothing on the other hand which produces more discords than
   when we think too highly of ourselves. Wisely then does Peter bid us to
   be humble-minded (tapeinophrones,) lest pride and haughtiness should
   lead us to despise our neighbors. [40]

   9 Not rendering evil for evil In these words every kind of revenge is
   forbidden; for in order to preserve love, we must bear with many
   things. At the same time he does not speak here of mutual benevolence,
   but he would have us to endure wrongs, when provoked by ungodly men.
   And though it is commonly thought that it is an instance of a weak and
   abject mind, not to avenge injuries, yet it is counted before God as
   the highest magnanimity. Nor is it indeed enough to abstain from
   revenge; but Peter requires also that we should pray for those who
   reproach us; for to bless here means to pray, as it is set in
   opposition to the second clause. But Peter teaches us in general, that
   evils are to be overcome by acts of kindness. This is indeed very hard,
   but we ought to imitate in this case our heavenly Father, who makes his
   sun to rise on the unworthy. What the sophists imagine to be the
   meaning, is a futile evasion; for when Christ said, "Love your
   enemies," he at the same time confirmed his own doctrine by saying,
   "That ye might be the children of God."

   Knowing that ye are thereunto called He means that this condition was
   required of the faithful when they were called by God, that they were
   not only to be so meek as not to retaliate injuries, but also to bless
   those who cursed them; and as this condition may seem almost unjust, he
   calls their attention to the reward; as though he had said, that there
   is no reason why the faithful should complain, because their wrongs
   would turn to their own benefit. In short, he shews how much would be
   the gain of patience; for if we submissively bear injuries, the Lord
   will bestow on us his blessing.

   The verb, kleronomein, to inherit, seems to express perpetuity, as
   though Peter had said, that the blessing would not be for a short time,
   but perpetual, if we be submissive in bearing injuries. But God blesses
   in a way different, from men; for we express our wishes to him, but he
   confers a blessing on us. And on the other hand, Peter intimates that
   they who seek to revenge injuries, attempt what will yield them no
   good, for they thus deprive themselves of God's blessing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [39] In the previous statements of particular duties belonging to
   various relations in life, the duty of masters towards their servants
   is omitted. Some have hence inferred that there were no masters who
   were Christians among those to whom Peter wrote. But this could not
   have been the ease, and for this reason, because Paul, in his Epistles
   to the Ephesians and Colossians, expressly specifies the duty of
   masters towards their servants; and Ephesus and Colosse were included
   in Asia Minor, and it was to Christians scattered throughout that
   country that Peter wrote his Epistle. But this omission is somewhat
   singular. At the same time, though the master's duty is not
   specifically mentioned, we may yet consider this verse as having a
   special reference to masters, as sympathy, brotherly love, and
   compassion or commiseration, are here inculcated. The construction of
   the whole passage, beginning at the 17th verse of the last chapter, and
   ending at the 12th of this (for at the 13th of this, he resumes the
   subject he left off at the end of the 16th of the last) deserves to be
   noticed. "Honour all," is the injunction which he afterwards
   exemplifies as to servants, wives, and husbands; for the construction
   is "Honour all -- the servants being subject, etc. -- in like manner,
   the wives being subject, etc. -- in like manner, the husbands,
   cohabiting according to knowledge, giving honor, etc." Then follows
   this verse in the same form, "And finally, all being of one mind,
   sympathizing, loving the brethren, compassionate, friendly-minded (or
   humble-minded,) not rendering, etc." And thus he proceeds to the end of
   the 12th verse. Afterwards he resumes the subject respecting the
   treatment the Christians met with from the world. May we not then
   conclude, that as the duty of masters does not come under the idea of
   honoring, he did not specifically mention them, but referred only to
   the spirit and temper they ought to have exhibited? -- Ed.

   [40] Griesbach has given the preference to tapeinophrones and has
   introduced it into the text. -- Ed.

   1 Peter 3:10-15

   10. For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his
   tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:

   10. Qui enim vult vitam diligere, et videre dies bonos, contineat
   linguam suam à malo, et labia sua, ne loquantur dolum;

   11. Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.

   11. Declinet à malo et faciat bonum, quaerat pacem et persequatur eam:

   12. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are
   open, unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that
   do evil.

   12. Quoniam oculi Domini super justos, et aures ejus in preces eorum;
   vultus autem Domini super facientes mala.

   13. And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which
   is good?

   13. Et quis est qui vobis malè faciat, si boni aemuli sitis?

   14. But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be
   not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;

   14. Verum etiam si patiamini propter justitiam, beati; timorem vero
   eorum ne timeatis neque turbemini;

   15. But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts:

   15. Sed Dominum exercituum sanctificate in cordibus vestris.


   10 For he He confirms the last sentence by the testimony of David. The
   passage is taken from the thirty-fourth Psalm, [Psalm 34:12-16,] where
   the Spirit testifies that it will be well with all who keep themselves
   from all evil-doing and wrong-doing. The common feeling indeed favors
   what is very different; for men think that they expose themselves to
   the insolence of enemies, if they do not boldly defend themselves. But
   the Spirit of God promises a happy life to none except to the meek, and
   those who endure evils; and we cannot be happy except God prospers our
   ways; and it is the good and the benevolent, and not the cruel and
   inhuman, that he will favor.

   Peter has followed the Greek version, though the difference is but
   little. David's words are literally these, -- "He who loves life and
   desires to see good days," etc. It is indeed a desirable thing, since
   God has placed us in this world, to pass our time in peace. Then, the
   way of obtaining this blessing is to conduct ourselves justly and
   harmlessly towards all.

   The first thing he points out are the vices of the tongue; which are to
   be avoided, so that we may not be contumelious and insolent, nor speak
   deceitfully and with duplicity. Then he comes to deeds, that we are to
   injure none, or cause loss to none, but to endeavor to be kind to all,
   and to exercise the duties of humanity.

   11 Let him seek peace It is not enough to embrace it when offered to
   us, but it ought to be followed when it seems to flee from us. It also
   often happens, that when we seek it as much as we can, others will not
   grant it to us. On account of these difficulties and hindrances, he
   bids us to seek and pursue it.

   12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, or, on the
   righteous. It ought to be a consolation to us, sufficient to mitigate
   all evils, that we are looked upon by the Lord, so that he will bring
   us help in due time. The meaning then is, that the prosperity which he
   has mentioned depends on the protection of God; for were not the Lord
   to care for his people, they would be like sheep exposed to wolves. And
   that we for little reason raise a clamor, that we suddenly kindle unto
   wrath, that we burn with the passion of revenge, all this, doubtless,
   happens, because we do not consider that God cares for us, and because
   we do not acquiesce in his aid. Thus in vain we shall be taught
   patience, except our minds are first imbued with this truth, that God
   exercises such care over us, that he will in due time succor us. When,
   on the contrary, we are fully persuaded that God defends the cause of
   the righteous, we shall first attend simply to innocence, and then,
   when molested and hated by the ungodly, we shall flee to the protection
   of God. And when he says, that the ears of the Lord are open to our
   prayers, he encourages us to pray.

   But the face of the Lord By this clause he intimates that the Lord will
   be our avenger, because he will not always suffer the insolence of the
   ungodly to prevail; and at the same time he shews how it will be, if we
   seek to defend our life from injuries, even that God will be an
   adversary to us. But it may, on the other hand, be objected and said,
   that we experience it daily far otherwise, for the more righteous any
   one is, and the greater lover of peace he is, the more he is harassed
   by the wicked. To this I reply, that no one is so attentive to
   righteousness and peace, but that he sometimes sins in this respect.
   But it ought to be especially observed, that the promises as to this
   life do not extend further than as to what is expedient for us to be
   fulfilled. Hence, our peace with the world is often disturbed, that our
   flesh may be subdued, in order that we may serve God, and also for
   other reasons; so that nothing may be a loss to us.

   13 Who is he that will harm you He further confirms the previous
   sentence by an argument drawn from common experience. For it happens
   for the most part, that the ungodly disturb us, or are provoked by us,
   or that we do not labor to do them good as it behoves us; for they who
   seek to do good, do even soften minds which are otherwise hard as iron.
   This very thing is mentioned by Plato in his first book on the
   Republic, "Injustice," he says, "causes seditions and hatreds and
   fightings one with another; but justice, concord and friendship." [41]
   However, though this commonly happens, yet it is not always the case;
   for the children of God, how much soever they may strive to pacify the
   ungodly by kindness, and shew themselves kind towards all, are yet
   often assailed undeservedly by many.

   14. Hence Peter adds, But if ye suffer for righteousness' sake The
   meaning is, that the faithful will do more towards obtaining a quiet
   life by kindness, than by violence and promptitude in taking revenge;
   but that when they neglect nothing to secure peace, were they to
   suffer, they are still blessed, because they suffer for the sake of
   righteousness. Indeed, this latter clause differs much from the
   judgment of our flesh; but Christ has not without reason thus declared;
   nor has Peter without reason repeated the sentence from his mouth; for
   God will at length come as a deliverer, and then openly will appear
   what now seems incredible, that is, that the miseries of the godly have
   been blessed when endured with patience.

   To suffer for righteousness, means not only to submit to some loss or
   disadvantage in defending a good cause, but also to suffer unjustly,
   when any one is innocently in fear among men on account of the fear of
   God.

   Be not afraid of their terror He again points out the fountain and
   cause of impatience, that we are beyond due measure troubled, when the
   ungodly rise up against us. For such a dread either disheartens us, or
   degrades us, or kindles within us a desire for revenge. In the
   meantime, we do not acquiesce in the defense of God. Then the best
   remedy for checking the turbulent emotions of our minds will be, to
   conquer immoderate terrors by trusting in the aid of God.

   But Peter no doubt meant to allude to a passage in the eighth chapter
   of Isaiah; [Isaiah 8:12-17;] for when the Jews against the prohibition
   of God sought to fortify themselves by the aid of the Gentile world,
   God warned his Prophet not to fear after their example. Peter at the
   same time seems to have turned "fear" into a different meaning; for it
   is taken passively by the Prophet, who accused the people of unbelief,
   because, at a time when they ought to have relied on the aid of God and
   to have boldly despised all dangers, they became so prostrate and
   broken down with fear, that they sent to all around them for unlawful
   help. But Peter takes fear in another sense, as meaning that terror
   which the ungodly are wont to fill us with by their violence and cruel
   threatenings. He then departs from the sense in which the word is taken
   by the Prophet; but in this there is nothing unreasonable; for his
   object was not to explain the words of the Prophet; he wished only to
   shew that, nothing is fitter to produce patience than what Isaiah
   prescribes, even to ascribe to God his honor by recumbing in full
   confidence on his power.

   I do not, however, object, if any one prefers to render Peter's words
   thus, Fear ye not their fear; as though he had said, "Be ye not afraid
   as the unbelieving, or the children of this world are wont to be,
   because they understand nothing of God's providence." But this, as I
   think, would be a forced explanation. There is, indeed, no need for us
   to toil much on this point, since Peter here did not intend to explain
   every word used by the Prophet, but only referred to this one thing,
   that the faithful will firmly stand, and can never be moved from a
   right course of duty by any dread or fear, if they will sanctify the
   Lord.

   But this sanctification ought to be confined to the present case. For
   whence is it that we are overwhelmed with fear, and think ourselves
   lost, when danger is impending, except that we ascribe to mortal man
   more power to injure us than to God to save us? God promises that he
   will be the guardian of our salvation; the ungodly, on the other hand,
   attempt to subvert it. Unless God's promise sustain us, do we not deal
   unjustly with him, and in a manner profane him? Then the Prophet
   teaches us that we ought to think honourably of the Lord of hosts; for
   how much soever the ungodly may contrive to destroy us, and whatever
   power they may possess, he alone is more than sufficiently powerful to
   secure our safety. [42] Peter then adds, in your hearts. For if this
   conviction takes full possession of our minds, that the help promised
   by the Lord is sufficient for us, we shall be well fortified to repel
   all the fears of unbelief.

   1 Peter 3:15-16

   15. And be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you
   a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:

   15 Parati autem sitis ad responsionem cuivis poscenti à vobis rationem
   ejus quae in vobis est spei;

   16. Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as
   of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good
   conversation in Christ.

   16. Cum mansuetudine et timore, conscientiam habentes bonam; ut in quo
   de vobis obtrectant, tanquam maleficis, pudefiant dum infamant bonam
   vestram in Christo conversationem.


   Though this is a new precept, it yet depends on what is gone before,
   for he requires such constancy in the faithful, as boldly to give a
   reason for their faith to their adversaries. And this is a part of that
   sanctification which he had just mentioned; for we then really honor
   God, when neither fear nor shame hinders us from making a profession of
   our faith. But Peter does not expressly bid us to assert and proclaim
   what has been given us by the Lord everywhere, and always and among all
   indiscriminately, for the Lord gives his people the spirit of
   discretion, so that they may know when and how far and to whom it is
   expedient to speak. He bids them only to be ready to give an answer,
   lest by their sloth and the cowardly fear of the flesh they should
   expose the doctrine of Christ, by being silent, to the derision of the
   ungodly. The meaning then is, that we ought to be prompt in avowing our
   faith, so as to set it forth whenever necessary, lest the unbelieving
   through our silence should condemn the religion we follow.

   But it ought to be noticed, that Peter here does not command us to be
   prepared to solve any question that may be mooted; for it is not the
   duty of all to speak on every subject. But it is the general doctrine
   that is meant, which belongs to the ignorant and the simple. Then Peter
   had in view no other thing, than that Christians should make it evident
   to unbelievers that they truly worshipped God, and had a holy and good
   religion. And in this there is no difficulty, for it would be strange
   if we could bring nothing to defend our faith when any one made
   inquiries respecting it. For we ought always to take care that all may
   know that we fear God, and that we piously and reverently regard his
   legitimate worship.

   This was also required by the state of the times: the Christian name
   was much hated and deemed infamous; many thought the sect wicked and
   guilty of many sacrileges. It would have been, therefore, the highest
   perfidy against God, if, when asked, they had neglected to give a
   testimony in favor of their religion. And this, as I think, is the
   meaning of the word apology, which Peter uses, that is, that the
   Christians were to make it evident to the world that they were far off
   from every impiety, and did not corrupt true religion, on which account
   they were suspected by the ignorant.

   Hope here is by a metonymy to be taken for faith. Peter, however, as it
   has been said, does not require them to know how to discuss distinctly
   and refinedly every article of the faith, but only to shew that their
   faith in Christ was consistent with genuine piety. And hence we learn
   how all those abuse the name of Christians, who understand nothing
   certain respecting their faith, and have nothing to give as an answer
   for it. But it behoves us again carefully to consider what he says,
   when he speaks of that hope that is in you; for he intimates that the
   confession which flows from the heart is alone that which is approved
   by God; for except faith dwells within, the tongue prattles in vain. It
   ought then to have its roots within us, so that it may afterwards bring
   forth the fruit of confession.

   16 With meekness This is a most necessary admonition; for unless our
   minds are endued with meekness, contentions will immediately break
   forth. And meekness is set in opposition to pride and vain ostentation,
   and also to excessive zeal. To this he justly adds fear; for where
   reverence for God prevails, it tames all the ferocity of our minds, and
   it will especially cause us to speak calmly of God's mysteries. For
   contentious disputes arise from this, because many think less
   honourably than they ought of the greatness of divine wisdom, and are
   carried away by profane audacity. If, then, we would render approved of
   God the confession of our faith, all boasting must be put aside, all
   contention must be relinquished.

   Having a good conscience What we say without a corresponding life has
   but little weight; hence he joins to confession a good conscience. For
   we see that many are sufficiently ready with their tongue, and prate
   much, very freely, and yet with no fruit, because the life does not
   correspond. Besides, the integrity of conscience alone is that which
   gives us confidence in speaking as we ought; for they who prattle much
   about the gospel, and whose dissolute life is a proof of their impiety,
   not only make themselves objects of ridicule, but also expose the truth
   itself to the slanders of the ungodly. For why did he before bid us to
   be ready to defend the faith, should any one require from us a reason
   for it, except that it is our duty to vindicate the truth of God
   against those false suspicions which the ignorant entertain respecting
   it. But the defense of the tongue will avail but little, except the
   life corresponds with it.

   He therefore says, that they may be ashamed, who blame your good
   conversation in Christ, and who speak against you as evil-doers; as
   though he had said, "If your adversaries have nothing to allege against
   you, except that you follow Christ, they will at length be ashamed of
   their malicious wickedness, or at least, your innocence will be
   sufficient to confute them."

   1 Peter 3:17-18

   17. For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well
   doing, than for evil doing.

   17. Praestat enim benefaciendo (si ita fert voluntas Dei) pati quàm
   malefaciendo:

   18. For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
   unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh,
   but quickened by the Spirit:

   18. Quia et Christus semel pro peccatis passus est, justus pro
   injustis, ut nos adduceret Deo; mortificatus quidem carne, vivificatus
   autem spiritu.


   17 For it is better This belongs not only to what follows but to the
   whole context. He had spoken of the profession of faith, which at that
   time was attended with great danger; he says now that it is much
   better, if they sustained any loss in defending a good cause, to suffer
   thus unjustly than to be punished for their evil deeds. This
   consolation is understood rather by secret meditation, than by many
   words. It is what indeed occurs everywhere in profane authors, that
   there is a sufficient defense in a good conscience, whatever evils may
   happen, and must be endured. These have spoken courageously; but then
   the only really bold man is he who looks to God. Therefore Peter added
   this clause, If the will of God be so For in these words he reminds us,
   that if we suffer unjustly, it is not by chance, but according to the
   divine will; and he assumes, that God wills nothing or appoints nothing
   but for the best reason. Hence the faithful have always this comfort in
   their miseries, that they know that they have God as their witness, and
   that they also know that they are led by him to the contest, in order
   that they may under his protection give a proof of their faith.

   18 For Christ also It is another comfort, that if in our afflictions we
   are conscious of having done well, we suffer according to the example
   of Christ; and it hence follows that we are blessed. At the same time
   he proves, from the design of Christ's death, that it is by no means
   consistent with our profession that we should suffer for our evil
   deeds. For he teaches us that Christ suffered in order to bring us to
   God. What does this mean, except that we have been thus consecrated to
   God by Christ's death, that we may live and die to him?

   There are, then, two parts in this sentence; the first is, that
   persecutions ought to be borne with resignation, because the Son of God
   shews the way to us; and the other is, that since we have been
   consecrated to God's service by the death of Christ, it behoves us to
   suffer, not for our faults, but for righteousness' sake.

   Here, however, a question may be raised, Does not God chastise the
   faithful, whenever he suffers them to be afflicted? To this I answer,
   that it indeed often happens, that God punishes them according to what
   they deserve; and this is not denied by Peter; but he reminds us what a
   comfort it is to have our cause connected with God. And how God does
   not punish sins in them who endure persecution for the sake of
   righteousness, and in what sense they are said to be innocent, we shall
   see in the next chapter.

   Being put to death in the flesh Now this is a great thing, that we are
   made conformable to the Son of God, when we suffer without cause; but
   there is added another consolation, that the death of Christ had a
   blessed issue; for though he suffered through the weakness of the
   flesh, he yet rose again through the power of the Spirit. Then the
   cross of Christ was not prejudicial, nor his death, since life obtained
   the victory. This was said (as Paul also reminds us in 2 Corinthians
   4:10) that we may know that we are to bear in our body the dying of
   Christ, in order that his life may be manifested in us. Flesh here
   means the outward man; and Spirit means the divine power, by which
   Christ emerged from death a conqueror.

   1 Peter 3:19-22

   19. By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

   19. In quo et iis qui in specula (vel, in excubiis, vel, carcere) erant
   spiritibus, profectus prædicavit;

   20. Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of
   God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein
   few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.

   20. Quum inereduli fuissent olim, quum semel expectabatur Dei patientia
   in diebus Noe; dum apparabatur arca, in qua paucae, hoc est, octo
   animae servatae sunt per aquam.

   21. The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not
   the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
   conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:

   21. Cujus figura respondens baptismus, nos quoque salvos reddit, non
   abjectio sordium carnis, sed bonae conscientiae examen apud Deum, per
   resurrectionem Jesu Christi:

   22. Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels
   and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

   22. Qui est in dextera Dei profectus in coelum, subjectis sibi angelis,
   et potestatibus et virtutibus.


   19 By which also Peter added this, that we might know that the
   vivifying power of the Spirit of which he spoke, was not only put forth
   as to Christ himself, but is also poured forth with regard to us, as
   Paul shews in Romans 5:5. He then says, that Christ did not rise only
   for himself, but that he made known to others the same power of his
   Spirit, so that it penetrated to the dead. It hence follows, that we
   shall not less feel it in vivifying whatever is mortal in us.

   But as the obscurity of this passage has produced, as usual, various
   explanations, I shall first disprove what has been brought forward by
   some, and secondly, we shall seek its genuine and true meaning.

   Common has been the opinion that Christ's descent into hell is here
   referred to; but the words mean no such thing; for there is no mention
   made of the soul of Christ, but only that he went by the Spirit: and
   these are very different things, that Christ's soul went, and that
   Christ preached by the power of the Spirit. Then Peter expressly
   mentioned the Spirit, that he might take away the notion of what may be
   called a real presence.

   Others explain this passage of the apostles, that Christ by their
   ministry appeared to the dead, that is, to unbelievers. I, indeed,
   allow that Christ by means of his apostles went by his Spirit to those
   who were kept as it were in prison; but this exposition appears
   incorrect on several accounts: First, Peter says that Christ went to
   spirits, by which he means souls separated from their bodies, for
   living men are never called spirits; and secondly, what Peter repeats
   in the fourth chapter on the same subject, does not admit of such an
   allegory. Therefore the words must be properly understood of the dead.
   Thirdly, it seems very strange, that Peter, speaking of the apostles,
   should immediately, as though forgetting himself, go back to the time
   of Noah. Certainly this mode of speaking would be most unsuitable. Then
   this explanation cannot be right.

   Moreover, the strange notion of those who think that unbelievers as to
   the coming of Christ, were after his death freed from their sin, needs
   no long refutation; for it is an indubitable doctrine of Scripture,
   that we obtain not salvation in Christ except by faith; then there is
   no hope left for those who continue to death unbelieving. They speak
   what is somewhat more probable, who say, that the redemption obtained
   by Christ availed the dead, who in the time of Noah were long
   unbelieving, but repented a short time before they were drowned by the
   deluge. They then understood that they suffered in the flesh the
   punishment due to their perverseness, and yet were saved by Christ, so
   that they did not perish for ever. But this interpretation cannot
   stand; it is indeed inconsistent with the words of the passage, for
   Peter ascribes salvation only to the family of Noah, and gives over to
   ruin all who were not within the ark.

   I therefore have no doubt but Peter speaks generally, that the
   manifestation of Christ's grace was made to godly spirits, and that
   they were thus endued with the vital power of the Spirit. Hence there
   is no reason to fear that it will not flow to us. But it may be
   inquired, Why he puts in prison the souls of the godly after having
   quitted their bodies? It seems to me that phulake rather means a
   watchtower in which watchmen stand for the purpose of watching, or the
   very act of watching, for it is often so taken by Greek authors; and
   the meaning would be very appropriate, that godly souls were watching
   in hope of the salvation promised them, as though they saw it afar off.
   Nor is there a doubt but that the holy fathers in life, as well as
   after death, directed their thoughts to this object. But if the word
   prison be preferred, it would not be unsuitable; for, as while they
   lived, the Law, according to Paul, (Galatians 3:23,) was a sort of
   prison in which they were kept; so after death they must have felt the
   same desire for Christ; for the spirit of liberty had not as yet been
   fully given. Hence this anxiety of expectation was to them a kind of
   prison.

   Thus far the Apostle's words seem to agree together, and with the
   thread of the argument; but what follows is attended with some
   difficulty; for he does not mention the faithful here, but only the
   unbelieving; and this seems to overturn the preceding exposition. Some
   have for this reason been led to think that no other thing is said
   here, but that the unbelieving, who had formerly persecuted the godly,
   found the Spirit of Christ an accuser, as though Peter consoled the
   faithful with this argument, that Christ, even when dead, punished
   them. But their mistake is discovered by what we shall see in the next
   chapter, that the Gospel was preached to the dead, that they might live
   according to God in the spirit, which peculiarly applies to the
   faithful. And it is further certain that he repeats there what he now
   says. Besides, they have not considered that what Peter meant was
   especially this, that as the power of the Spirit of Christ shewed
   itself to be vivifying in him, and was known as such by the dead, so it
   will be towards us.

   Let us, however, see why it is that he mentions only the unbelieving;
   for he seems to say, that Christ in spirit appeared to those who
   formerly were unbelieving; but I understand him otherwise, that then
   the true servants of God were mixed together with the unbelieving, and
   were almost hidden on account of their number. I allow that the Greek
   construction is at variance with this meaning, for Peter, if he meant
   this, ought to have used the genitive case absolute. But as it was not
   unusual with the Apostles to put one case instead of another, and as we
   see that Peter here heaps together many things, and no other suitable
   meaning can be elicited, I have no hesitation in giving this
   explanation of this intricate passage; so that readers may understand
   that those called unbelieving are different from those to whom he said
   the Gospel was preached.

   After having then said that Christ was manifested to the dead, he
   immediately adds, When there were formerly unbelievers; by which he
   intimated, that it was no injury to the holy fathers that they were
   almost hidden through the vast number of the ungodly. For he meets, as
   I think, a doubt, which might have harassed the faithful of that day.
   They saw almost the whole world filled with unbelievers, that they
   enjoyed all authority, and that life was in their power. This trial
   might have shaken the confidence of those who were shut up, as it were,
   under the sentence of death. Therefore Peter reminds them, that the
   condition of the fathers was not different, and that though the
   multitude of the ungodly then covered the whole earth, their life was
   yet preserved in safety by the power of God.

   He then comforted the godly, lest they should be cast down and
   destroyed because they were so few; and he chose an example the most
   remarkable in antiquity, even that of the world drowned by the deluge;
   for then in the common ruin of mankind, the family of Noah alone
   escaped. And he points out the manner, and says that it was a kind of
   baptism. There is then in this respect also nothing unsuitable.

   The sum of what is said is this, that the world has always been full of
   unbelievers, but that the godly ought not to be terrified by their vast
   number; for though Noah was surrounded on every side by the ungodly,
   and had very few as his friends, he was not yet drawn aside from the
   right course of his faith. [43]

   When once the long-suffering of God waited This ought to be applied to
   the ungodly, whom God's patience rendered more slothful; for when God
   deferred his vengeance and did not immediately execute it, the ungodly
   boldly disregarded all threatenings; but Noah, on the contrary, being
   warned by God, had the deluge for a long time before his eyes. Hence
   his assiduity in building the ark; for being terrified by God's
   judgment, he shook off all torpidity.

   21 The like figure whereunto I fully think that the relative ought to
   be read in the dative case, and that it has happened, through a
   mistake, that ho is put, and not ho. The meaning, however, is not
   ambiguous, that Noah, saved by water, had a sort of baptism. And this
   the Apostle mentions, that the likeness between him and us might appear
   more evident. It has already been said that the design of this clause
   is to shew that we ought not to be led away by wicked examples from the
   fear of God, and the right way of salvation, and to mix with the world.
   This is made evident in baptism, in which we are buried together with
   Christ, so that, being dead to the world, and to the flesh, we may live
   to God. On this account, he says that our baptism is an antitype
   (antitupon) to the baptism of Noah, not that Noah's baptism was the
   first pattern, and ours an inferior figure, as the word is taken in the
   Epistle to the Hebrews, where the ceremonies of the law are said to be
   antitypes of heavenly things, (Hebrews 9:9,10.) Greek writers apply the
   same word to sacraments, so that, when they speak of the mystical bread
   of the holy Supper, they call it the antitype. But here there is no
   comparison made between the greater and the less; the Apostle only
   means that there is a likeness, and as they commonly say, a
   correspondence. Perhaps it might more properly be said to be
   correspondency, (antistrophon,) as Aristotle makes Dialectics to be the
   antistrophè of Rhetoric. But we need not labor about words, when there
   is an agreement about the thing itself. As Noah, then, obtained life
   through death, when in the ark, he was enclosed not otherwise than as
   it were in the grave, and when the whole world perished, he was
   preserved together with his small family; so at this day, the death
   which is set forth in baptism, is to us an entrance into life, nor can
   salvation be hoped for, except we be separated from the world.

   Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh This was added, because
   it might be that the greatest part of men would profess the name of
   Christ; and so it is with us, almost all are introduced into the church
   by baptism. Thus, what he had said before would not be appropriate,
   that few at this day are saved by baptism, as God saved only eight by
   the ark. This objection Peter anticipates, when he testifies that he
   speaks not of the naked sign, but that the effect must also be
   connected with it, as though he had said, that what happened in the age
   of Noah would always be the case, that mankind would rush on to their
   own destruction, but that the Lord would in a wonderful way deliver His
   very small flock.

   We now see what this connection means; for some one might object and
   say, "Our baptism is widely different from that of Noah, for it happens
   that most are at this day baptized." To this he replies, that the
   external symbol is not sufficient, except baptism be received really
   and effectually: and the reality of it will be found only in a few. It
   hence follows that we ought carefully to see how men commonly act when
   we rely on examples, and that we ought not to fear though we may be few
   in number.

   But the fanatics, such as Schuencfeldius, absurdly pervert this
   testimony, while they seek to take away from sacraments all their power
   and effect. For Peter did not mean here to teach that Christ's
   institution is vain and inefficacious, but only to exclude hypocrites
   from the hope of salvation, who, as far as they can, deprave and
   corrupt baptism. Moreover, when we speak of sacraments, two things are
   to be considered, the sign and the thing itself. In baptism the sign is
   water, but the thing is the washing of the soul by the blood of Christ
   and the mortifying of the flesh. The institution of Christ includes
   these two things. Now that the sign appears often inefficacious and
   fruitless, this happens through the abuse of men, which does not take
   away the nature of the sacrament. Let us then learn not to tear away
   the thing signified from the sign. We must at the same time beware of
   another evil, such as prevails among the Papists; for as they
   distinguish not as they ought between the thing and the sign, they stop
   at the outward element, and on that fix their hope of salvation.
   Therefore the sight of the water takes away their thoughts from the
   blood of Christ and the power of the Spirit. They do not regard Christ
   as the only author of all the blessings therein offered to us; they
   transfer the glory of his death to the water, they tie the secret power
   of the Spirit to the visible sign.

   What then ought we to do? Not to separate what has been joined together
   by the Lord. We ought to acknowledge in baptism a spiritual washing, we
   ought to embrace therein the testimony of the remission of sin and the
   pledge of our renovation, and yet so as to leave to Christ his own
   honor, and also to the Holy Spirit; so that no part of our salvation
   should be transferred to the sign. Doubtless when Peter, having
   mentioned baptism, immediately made this exception, that it is not the
   putting off of the filth of the flesh, he sufficiently shewed that
   baptism to some is only the outward act, and that the outward sign of
   itself avails nothing.

   But the answer of a good conscience The word question, or questioning,
   is to be taken here for "answer," or testimony. Now Peter briefly
   defines the efficacy and use of baptism, when he calls attention to
   conscience, and expressly requires that confidence which can sustain
   the sight of God and can stand before his tribunal. For in these words
   he teaches us that baptism in its main part is spiritual, and then that
   it includes the remission of sins and renovation of the old man; for
   how can there be a good and pure conscience until our old man is
   reformed, and we be renewed in the righteousness of God? and how can we
   answer before God, unless we rely on and are sustained by a gratuitous
   pardon of our sins? In short, Peter intended to set forth the effect of
   baptism, that no one might glory in a naked and dead sign, as
   hypocrites are wont to do.

   But we must notice what follows, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ By
   these words he teaches us that we are not to cleave to the element of
   water, and that what is thereby typified flows from Christ alone, and
   is to be sought from him. Moreover, by referring to the resurrection,
   he has regard to the doctrine which he had taught before, that Christ
   was vivified by the Spirit; for the resurrection was victory over death
   and the completion of our salvation. We hence learn that the death of
   Christ is not excluded, but is included in his resurrection. We then
   cannot otherwise derive benefit from baptism, than by having all our
   thoughts fixed on the death and the resurrection of Christ.

   22 Who is on the right hand of God. He recommends to us the ascension
   of Christ unto heaven, lest our eyes should seek him in the world; and
   this belongs especially to faith. He commends to our notice his session
   on the Father's right hand, lest we should doubt his power to save us.
   And what his sitting at the right hand of the Father means, we have
   elsewhere explained, that is, that Christ exercises supreme power
   everywhere as God's representative. And an explanation of this is what
   follows, angels being made subject to him; and he adds powers and
   authorities only for the sake of amplification, for angels are usually
   designated by such words. It was then Peter's object to set forth by
   these high titles the sovereignty of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [43] The most satisfactory explanation of this passage is that of Beza,
   Doddridge, Macknight, and Scott; that the reference is to what was done
   in the time of Noah, that is, that Christ by his Spirit employed him as
   a preacher of righteousness, though with no success, as the spirits of
   the men to whom he preached were then in prison, reserved, as the
   fallen angels are represented to be, for the judgment of the last day.
   The Apostle had before said that Christ's Spirit was in the prophets
   who foretold his coming, 1 Peter 1:11. The passage may be thus
   rendered, -- 19. "By which also he, having gone, preached to the
   spirits who are in prison, formerly disobedient, when the
   long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah," etc.; or, according
   to Mackight, "to the spirits now in prison, who formerly were
   disobedient," etc. The word "formerly" seems to require "now" in the
   previous clause, or, "who are," as rendered by Beza. "He, having gone,
   preached," is similar to a phrase in Ephesians 2:17, "And came and
   preached," etc.; or, literally, "And having come he preached," etc.
   Paul does not speak of his coming personally, but by his ministers: and
   Peter evidently speaks of his going in the same sense. For hapax
   exedecheto, Griesbach substitutes apexedecheto as being the most
   approved reading. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Peter 4:1-5

   1. Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
   yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in
   the flesh hath ceased from sin;

   1. Christo igitur passo pro nobis carne, vos quoque eadem cogitatione
   armamini; quod scilicet qui passus est in carne, destitit à peccato;

   2. That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to
   the lusts of men, but to the will of God.

   2. Ne amplius hominum concupiscentiis, sed voluntati Dei, quod residuum
   est temporis in carne, vivat.

   3. For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the
   will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess
   of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:

   3. Satis enim nobis est quod anteacto vitae tempore voluntatem gentium
   patraverimus, quum ambularemus in lasciviis, concupiscentiis,
   comessationibus, potationibus et nefariis idololatriis:

   4. Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same
   excess of riot, speaking evil of you:

   4. Quod illis videtur insolens, quòd non concurratis in eandem luxus
   profusionem, ideoque malè loquuntur;

   5. Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and
   the dead.

   5. Qui reddituri sunt rationem ei qui paratus est judicare vivos et
   mortuos.


   1 Forasmuch then as Christ When he had before set forth Christ before
   us, he only spoke of the suffering of the cross; for sometimes the
   cross means mortification, because the outward man is wasted by
   afflictions, and our flesh is also subdued. But he now ascends higher;
   for he speaks of the reformation of the whole man. The Scripture
   recommends to us a twofold likeness to the death of Christ, that we are
   to be conformed to him in reproaches and troubles, and also that the
   old man being dead and extinct in us, we are to be renewed to a
   spiritual life. (Philippians 3:10; Romans 6:4.) Yet Christ is not
   simply to be viewed as our example, when we speak of the mortificaion
   of the flesh; but it is by his Spirit that we are really made
   conformable to his death, so that it becomes effectual to the
   crucifying of our flesh. In short, as Peter at the end of the last
   chapter exhorted us to patience after the example of Christ, because
   death was to him a passage to life; so now from the same death he
   deduces a higher doctrine, that we ought to die to the flesh and to the
   world, as Paul teaches us more at large in the sixth chapter of his
   Epistle to the Romans. He therefore says, arm yourselves, or be ye
   armed, intimating that we are really and effectually supplied with
   invincible weapons to subdue the flesh, if we partake as we ought of
   the efficacy of Christ's death.

   For he that hath suffered The particle hoti does not, I think, denote
   here the cause, but is to be taken as explanatory; for Peter sets forth
   what that thought or mind is with which Christ's death arms us, even
   that the dominion of sin ought to be abolished in us, so that God may
   reign in our life. Erasmus has incorrectly, as I think, rendered the
   word "he who did suffer," (patiebatur) applying it to Christ. For it is
   an indefinite sentence, which generally extends to all the godly, and
   has the same meaning with the words of Paul in Romans 6:7,

   "He who is dead is justified or freed from sin;"

   for both the Apostles intimate, that when we become dead to the flesh,
   we have no more to do with sin, that it should reign in us, and
   exercise its power in our life. [44]

   It may, however, be objected, that Peter here speaks unsuitably in
   making us to be conformable to Christ in this respect, that we suffer
   in the flesh; for it is certain that there was nothing sinful in Christ
   which required to be corrected. But the answer is obvious, that it is
   not necessary that a comparison should correspond in all its parts. It
   is then enough that we should in a measure be made conformable to the
   death of Christ. In the same way is also explained, not unfitly, what
   Paul says, that we are planted in the likeness of his death, (Romans
   6:5;) for the manner is not altogether the same, but that his death is
   become in a manner the type and pattern of our mortification.

   We must also notice that the word flesh is put here twice, but in a
   different sense; for when he says that Christ suffered in the flesh, he
   means that the human nature which Christ had taken from us was made
   subject to death, that is, that Christ as a man naturally died. In the
   second clause, which refers to us, flesh means the corruption, and the
   sinfulness of our nature; and thus suffering in the flesh signifies the
   denying of ourselves. We now see what is the likeness between Christ
   and us, and what is the difference; that as he suffered in the flesh
   taken from us, so the whole of our flesh ought to be crucified.

   2 That he no longer Here he sets forth the way of ceasing from sin,
   that renouncing the covetings of men we should study to form our life
   according to the will of God. And thus he includes here the two things
   in which renovation consists, the destruction of the flesh and the
   vivification of the spirit. The course of good living is thus to begin
   with the former, but we are to advance to the latter.

   Moreover, Peter defines here what is the rule of right living, even
   when man depends on the will of God. It hence follows, that nothing is
   right and well ordered in man's life as soon as he wanders from this
   rule. We ought further to notice the contrast between God's will and
   the covetings or lusts of men We hence understand how great is our
   depravity, and how we ought to strive to become obedient to God. When
   he says, the rest of time in the flesh, the word flesh means the
   present life, as in Hebrews 5:7

   3 For the time past of our life may suffice Peter does not mean that we
   ought to be wearied with pleasures, as those are wont to be who are
   filled with them to satiety; but that on the contrary the memory of our
   past life ought to stimulate us to repentance. And doubtless it ought
   to be the sharpest goad to make us run on well, when we recollect that
   we have been wandering from the right way the greatest part of our
   life. And Peter reminds us, that it would be most unreasonable were we
   not to change the course of our life after having been enlightened by
   Christ. For he makes a distinction here between the time of ignorance
   and the time of faith, as though he had said that it was but right that
   they should become new and different men from the time that Christ had
   called them. But instead of the lusts or covetings of men, he now
   mentions the will of the Gentiles, by which he reproves the Jews for
   having mixed with the Gentiles in all their pollutions, though the Lord
   had separated them from the Gentiles.

   In what follows he shews that those vices ought to be put off which
   prove men to be blind and ignorant of God. And there is a peculiar
   emphasis in the words, the time past of our life, for he intimates that
   we ought to persevere to the end, as when Paul says, that Christ was
   raised from the dead, to die no more. (Romans 6:6.) For we have been
   redeemed by the Lord for this end, that we may serve him all the days
   of our life.

   In lasciviousness He does not give the whole catalogue of sins, but
   only mentions some of them, by which we may briefly learn what those
   things are which men, not renewed by God's Spirit, desire and seek, and
   to which they are inclined. And he names the grosser vices, as it is
   usually done when examples are adduced. I shall not stop to explain the
   words, for there is no difficulty in them.

   But here a question arises, that Peter seems to have done wrong to
   many, in making all men guilty of lasciviousness, dissipation, lusts,
   drunkenness, and revellings; for it is certain that all were not
   involved in these vices; nay, we know that some among the Gentiles
   lived honourably and without a spot of infamy. To this I reply, that
   Peter does not so ascribe these vices to the Gentiles, as though he
   charged every individual with all these, but that we are by nature
   inclined to all these evils, and not only so, but that we are so much
   under the power of depravity, that these fruits which he mentions
   necessarily proceed from it as from an evil root. There is indeed no
   one who has not within him the seed of all vices, but all do not
   germinate and grow up in every individual. Yet the contagion is so
   spread and diffused through the whole human race, that the whole
   community appears infected with innumerable evils, and that no member
   is free or pure from the common corruption.

   The last clause may also suggest another question, for Peter addressed
   the Jews, and yet he says that they had been immersed in abominable
   idolatries; but the Jews then living in every part of the world
   carefully abstained from idols. A twofold answer may be adduced here,
   either that by mentioning the whole for a part, he declares of all what
   belonged to a few, (for there is no doubt but the Churches to which he
   wrote were made up of Gentiles as well as of Jews,) or that he calls
   those superstitions in which the Jews were then involved, idolatries;
   for though they professed to worship the God of Israel, yet we know
   that no part of divine worship was genuine among them. And how great
   must have been the confusion in barbarous countries and among a
   scattered people, when Jerusalem itself, from whose rays they borrowed
   their light, had fallen into extreme impiety! for we know that dotages
   of every kind prevailed with impunity, so that the high-priesthood, and
   the whole government of the Church, were in the power of the Sadducees.

   4 Wherein they think it strange The words of Peter literally are these,
   "In which they are strangers, you not running with them into the same
   excess of riot, blaspheming." But the word, to be strangers, means to
   stop at a thing as new and unusual. This is a way of speaking which the
   Latins also sometimes use, as when Cicero says that he was a stranger
   in the city, because he knew not what was carried on there. But in this
   place, Peter fortifies the faithful, lest they should suffer themselves
   to be disturbed or corrupted by the perverse judgments or words of the
   ungodly. For it is no light temptation, when they among whom we live,
   charge us that our life is different from that of mankind in general.
   "These," they say, "must form for themselves a new world, for they
   differ from all mankind." Thus they accuse the children of God, as
   though they attempted a separation from the whole world.

   Then the Apostle anticipated this, and forbade the faithful to be
   discouraged by such reproaches and calumnies; and he proposed to them,
   as a support, the judgment of God: for this it is that can sustain us
   against all assaults, that is, when we patiently wait for that day, in
   which Christ will punish all those who now presumptuously condemn us,
   and will shew that we and our cause are approved by Him. And he
   expressly mentions the living and the dead, lest we should think that
   we shall suffer any loss, if they remain alive when we are dead; for
   they shall not, for this reason, escape the hand of God. And in what
   sense he calls them the living and the dead, we may learn from the
   fifteenth chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians
     __________________________________________________________________

   [44] The subject of this passage, from 1 Peter 3:14 to 1 Peter 4:6, is
   suffering unjustly, or for righteousness' sake, and Christ is brought
   as an example, he being just, suffered for the unjust. After a
   digression at the 19th verse of the third chapter, the Apostle returns
   here to his former subject, the example of Christ suffering in the
   flesh or in his body and in order to retain still the idea that he was
   just when he suffered, this clause seems to have been put in
   parenthetically, "For he who suffered ceased from sin," that is, had no
   sin, but was just. And hence in the following verses he exhorts them to
   lead a holy life whatever might be the opposition from the world, so
   that they might be like their Savior, suffering unjustly, they
   themselves being innocent. 1. "Christ then having suffered for us in
   the flesh, arm ye also yourselves with the same mind, (for he who
   suffered in the flesh ceased from sin;) 2. so as to live no longer the
   remaining time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of
   God." They were exhorted to resolve to follow the example of Christ,
   but in such a way as not to suffer for their sins, but for
   righteousness' sake. It is implied that they had been evil-doers, but
   they were no longer to be so, otherwise their suffering in the flesh
   would not be like that of Christ. To suffer as well-doers, and not as
   evil-doers, was to suffer as Christ did. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Peter 4:6-11

   6. For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are
   dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live
   according to God in the spirit.

   6. In hoc enim et mortuis evangelizatus fuit (vel, praedicatum fuit
   evangelium,) ut judicentur quidem secundum homines carne, vivant autem
   secundum Deum spiritu.

   7. But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and
   watch unto prayer.

   7. Porro omnium finis propinquus est: sobrii itaque estote, et
   vigilantes ad precandum.

   8. And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for
   charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

   8. Ante omnia vero charitatem inter vos intentam habentes; quia
   charitas operiet multitudinem peccatorum.

   9. Use hospitality one to another without grudging.

   9. Invicem hospitales sine murmurationibus.

   10. As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one
   to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

   10. Ut quisque aecepit donum, ministrantes illud inter vos, tanquam
   boni dispensatores multiplicis gratiae Dei.

   11. If any speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man
   minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in
   all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and
   dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

   11. Siquis loquitur, loquatur tanquam eloquia Dei; siquis ministrat,
   tanquam ex virtute quam suppeditat Deus; ut in omnibus glorificetur
   Deus per Jesum Christum; cui est gloria et imperium in secula
   seculorum. Amen.


   6 For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead,
   or, He has been evangelized to the dead. We see in what sense he takes
   the former passage in the third chapter, even that death does not
   hinder Christ from being always our defender. It is then a remarkable
   consolation to the godly, that death itself brings no loss to their
   salvation. Though Christ, then, may not appear a deliverer in this
   life, yet his redemption is not void, or without effect; for his power
   extends to the dead. But as the Greek word is doubtful, it may be
   rendered in the masculine, or in the neuter gender; but the meaning is
   almost the same, that is, that Christ had been made known as a redeemer
   to the dead, or that salvation had been made known to them by the
   gospel. But if the grace of Christ once penetrated to the dead, there
   is no doubt but that we shall partake of it when dead. We then set for
   it limits much too narrow, if we confine it to the present life.

   That they might be judged I omit the explanations of others, for they
   seem to me to be very remote from the Apostle's meaning. This has been
   said, as I think, by way of anticipation, for it might have been
   objected, that the gospel is of no benefit to the dead, as it does not
   restore them to life. Peter concedes a part of this objection, and yet
   in such a way, that they are not deprived of the salvation obtained by
   Christ. Therefore, in the first clause, when he says, "that they might
   be judged in the flesh, according to men," it is a concession; and
   "judged" means here, as often elsewhere, condemned; and flesh is the
   outward man. So that the meaning is, that though according to the
   estimation of the world the dead suffer destruction in their flesh, and
   are deemed condemned as to the outward man, yet they cease not to live
   with God, and that in their spirit, because Christ quickens them by his
   Spirit.

   But we ought to add what Paul teaches us in Romans 8:10, that the
   Spirit is life; and hence it will be, that he will at length absorb the
   relics of death which still cleave to us. The sum of what he says is,
   that though the condition of the dead in the flesh is worse, according
   to man, yet it is enough that the Spirit of Christ revives them, and
   will eventually lead them to the perfection of life. [45]

   7 But, or, moreover, the end of all things is at hand Though the
   faithful hear that their felicity is elsewhere than in the world, yet,
   as they think that they should live long, this false thought renders
   them careless, and even slothful, so that they direct not their
   thoughts to the kingdom of God. Hence the Apostle, that he might rouse
   them from the drowsiness of the flesh, reminds them that the end of all
   things was nigh; by which he intimates that we ought not to sit still
   in the world, from which we must soon remove. He does not, at the same
   time, speak only of the end of individuals, but of the universal
   renovation of the world; as though he had said, "Christ will shortly
   come, who will put an end to all things."

   It is, then, no wonder that the cares of this world overwhelm us, and
   make us drowsy, if the view of present things dazzles our eyes: for we
   promise, almost all of us, an eternity to ourselves in this world; at
   least, the end never comes to our mind. But were the trumpet of Christ
   to sound in our ears, it would powerfully rouse us and not suffer us to
   lie torpid.

   But it may be objected and said, that a long series of ages has passed
   away since Peter wrote this, and yet that the end is not come. My reply
   to this is, that the time seems long to us, because we measure its
   length by the spaces of this fleeting life; but if we could understand
   the perpetuity of future life, many ages would appear to us like a
   moment, as Peter will also tell us in his second epistle. Besides, we
   must remember this principle, that from the time when Christ once
   appeared, there is nothing left for the faithful, but with suspended
   minds ever to look forward to his second coming. [46]

   The watchfulness and the sobriety to which he exhorted them, belong, as
   I think, to the mind rather than to the body. The words are similar to
   those of Christ:

   "Watch ye, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of
   Man cometh." (Matthew 25:13.)

   For as an indulgence in surfeiting and sleep renders the body unfit for
   its duties, so the vain cares and pleasures of the world inebriate the
   mind and render it drowsy.

   By adding prayer, he points out an exercise especially necessary, in
   which the faithful ought to be particularly occupied, since their whole
   strength depends on the Lord; as though he had said, "Since ye are in
   yourselves extremely weak, seek of the Lord to strengthen you." He yet
   reminds them that they were to pray earnestly, not formally.

   8 And above all things He commends charity or love as the first thing,
   for it is the bond of perfection. And he bids it to be fervent, or
   intense, or vehement, which is the same thing; for whosoever is
   immoderately fervent in self-love, loves others coldly. And he commends
   it on account of its fruit, because it buries innumerable sins, than
   which nothing is more desirable. But the sentence is taken from
   Solomon, whose words are found in Proverbs 10:12,

   "Hatred discovers reproaches, but love covers a multitude of sins."

   What Solomon meant is sufficiently clear, for the two clauses contain
   things which are set in contrast the one with the other. As then he
   says in the first clause that hatred is the cause why men traduce and
   defame one another, and spread whatever is reproachful and
   dishonorable; so it follows that a contrary effect is ascribed to love,
   that is, that men who love one another, kindly and courteously forgive
   one another; hence it comes that, willingly burying each other's vices,
   one seeks to preserve the honor of another. [47] Thus Peter confirms
   his exhortation, that nothing is more necessary than to cherish mutual
   love. For who is there that has not many faults? Therefore all stand in
   need of forgiveness, and there is no one who does not wish to be
   forgiven.

   This singular benefit love brings to us when it exists among us, so
   that innumerable evils are covered in oblivion. On the other hand,
   where loose reins are given to hatred, men by mutual biting and tearing
   must necessarily consume one another, as Paul says (Galatians 5:15.)

   And it ought to be noticed that Solomon does not say that only a few
   sins are covered, but a multitude of sins, according to what Christ
   declares, when he bids us to forgive our brethren seventy times seven,
   (Matthew 18:22.) But the more sins love covers, the more evident
   appears its usefulness for the wellbeing of mankind.

   This is the plain meaning of the words. It hence appears how absurd are
   the Papists, who seek to elicit from this passage their own
   satisfactions, as though almsgiving and other duties of charity were a
   sort of a compensation to God for blotting out their sins. [48] It is
   enough to point out by the way their gross ignorance, for in a matter
   so clear it would be superfluous to add many words.

   9 Use hospitality, or, Be hospitable. After having generally exhorted
   them to love one another, he specially mentions one of the duties of
   love. At that time hospitality was commonly used, and it was deemed in
   a manner a sacred kind of humanity, as we have stated elsewhere. He
   then bids them mutually to exercise it, so that no one might require
   more from others than what he himself was prepared to render. He adds,
   without murmurings, for it is a rare example that one spends himself
   and his own on his neighbor without any disparaging reflection. Then
   the Apostle would have us to show kindness willingly and with a
   cheerful mind.

   10 As every one hath received He reminds us what we ought to bear in
   mind when we do good to our neighbors; for nothing is more fitted to
   correct our murmurings than to remember that we do not give our own,
   but only dispense what God has committed to us. When therefore he says,
   "Minister the gift which every one has received," he intimates that to
   each had been distributed what they had, on this condition, that in
   helping their brethren they might be the ministers of God. And thus the
   second clause is an explanation of the first, for instead of ministry
   he mentions stewardship; and for what he had said, "as every one hath
   received the gift," he mentions the manifold graces which God variously
   distributes to us, so that each might confer in common his own portion.
   If then we excel others in any gift, let us remember that we are as to
   this the stewards of God, in order that we may kindly impart it to our
   neighbors as their necessity or benefit may require. Thus we ought to
   be disposed and ready to communicate.

   But this consideration is also very important, that the Lord hath so
   divided his manifold graces, that no one is to be content with one
   thing and with his own gifts, but every one has need of the help and
   aid of his brother. This, I say, is a bond which God hath appointed for
   retaining friendship among men, for they cannot live without mutual
   assistance. Thus it happens, that he who in many things seeks the aid
   of his brethren, ought to communicate to them more freely what he has
   received. This bond of unity has been observed and noticed by heathens.
   But Peter teaches us here that God had designedly done this, that he
   might bind men one to another.

   11 If any man speak As he had spoken of the right and faithful use of
   gifts, he specifies two things as examples, and he has chosen those
   which are the most excellent or the most renowned. The office of
   teaching in the Church is a remarkable instance of God's favor. He then
   expressly commands those called to this office to act faithfully;
   though he does not speak here only of what we owe to men, but also of
   what we owe to God, so that we may not deprive him of his glory.

   He who speaks, then, that is, who is rightly appointed by public
   authority, let him speak as the oracles of God; that is, let him
   reverently in God's fear and in sincerity perform the charge committed
   to him, regarding himself as engaged in God's work, and as ministering
   God's word and not his own. For he still refers to the doctrine, that
   when we confer any thing on the brethren, we minister to them by God's
   command what he has bestowed on us for that purpose. And truly, were
   all those who profess to be teachers in the Church duly to consider
   this one thing, there would be in them much more fidelity and
   devotedness. For how great a thing is this, that in teaching the
   oracles of God, they are representatives of Christ! Hence then comes so
   much carelessness and rashness, because the sacred majesty of God's
   word is not borne in mind but by a few; and so they indulge themselves
   as in a worldly stewardship.

   In the meantime, we learn from these words of Peter, that it is not
   lawful for those who are engaged in teaching to do anything else, but
   faithfully to deliver to others, as from hand to hand, the doctrine
   received from God; for he forbids any one to go forth, except he who is
   instructed in God's word, and who proclaims infallible oracles as it
   were from his mouth. He, therefore, leaves no room for human
   inventions; for he briefly defines the doctrine which ought to be
   taught in the Church. Nor is the particle of similitude introduced here
   for the purpose of modifying the sentence, as though it were sufficient
   to profess that it is God's word that is taught. This was, indeed,
   commonly the case formerly with false prophets; and we see at this day
   how arrogantly the Pope and his followers cover with this pretense all
   their impious traditions. But Peter did not intend to teach pastors
   such hypocrisy as this, to pretend that they had from God whatever
   doctrine it pleased them to announce, but, he took an argument from the
   subject itself, that he might exhort them to sobriety and meekness, to
   a reverence for God, and to an earnest attention to their work.

   If any man minister This second clause extends wider, it includes the
   office of teaching. But as it would have been too long to enumerate
   each of the ministerial works, he preferred summarily to speak of them
   all together, as though he had said, "Whatever part of the burden thou
   bearest in the Church, know that thou canst do nothing but what has
   been given time by the Lord, and that thou art nothing else but an
   instrument of God: take heed, then, not to abuse the grace of God by
   exalting thyself; take heed not to suppress the power of God, which
   puts forth and manifests itself in the ministry for the salvation of
   the brethren." Let him then minister as by God's power, that is, let
   him regard nothing as his own, but let him humbly render service to God
   and his Church.

   That God in all things may be glorified When he says, In all, the word
   may be in the masculine or in the neuter gender; and thus men or gifts
   may be meant, and both meanings are equally suitable. The sense is,
   that God does not adorn us with his gifts, that he may rob himself and
   make himself as it were an empty idol by transferring to us his own
   glory, but that, on the contrary, his own glory may everywhere shine
   forth; and that it is therefore a sacrilegious profanation of God's
   gifts when men propose to themselves any other object than to glorify
   God. He says through Jesus Christ, because whatever power we have to
   minister, he alone bestows it on us; for he is the head, with which the
   whole body is connected by joints and bindings, and maketh increase in
   the Lord, according as he supplieth strength to every member.

   To whom be praise, or glory. Some refer this to Christ; but the context
   requires that it should be rather applied to God; for he confirms the
   last exhortation, because God justly claims all the glory; and,
   therefore, men wickedly take away from him what is his own, when they
   obscure in anything, or in any part, his glory.

   [45] Whitby, Doddridge, and Mackight, regard the dead here as the dead
   in sins, according to Ephesians 2:1. The first thus paraphrases what
   follows, "That they might condemn their former life, and live a
   better;" the second, "That they might be brought to such a state of
   life as their carnal neighbors will look upon it as a kind of
   condemnation and death;" and the third, "That although they might be
   condemned, indeed, by men in the flesh, yet they might live eternally
   by God in the Spirit." Beza, Hammond, and Scott, consider that the dead
   were those already dead, that is, when the Apostle wrote, and even
   before the coming of Christ, taking the dead in the same sense as in
   the former verse: but they differ as to the clause which follows. The
   two first interpret it as signifying the same as dying to sin and
   living to God, a meaning which the former part of the clause can hardly
   bear: but the view of Scott is, that the gospel had been preached to
   those at that time dead, that they might be condemned by carnal men, or
   in the flesh, as evildoers, but live to God through the Holy Spirit.
   The only fault, perhaps, with this rendering is as to the word flesh,
   which seems to mean here the same as flesh in 1 Peter 3:18, that is,
   the body; and the word spirit is also in the same form, for Griesbach
   in that verse regards the article to as spurious. Then the rendering
   would be, "That they might be condemned in the flesh by men, but live
   as to God through the Spirit." There are two previous instances of the
   word spirit, when denoting the Holy Spirit, being without the article,
   that is, in 1 Peter 1:2 and 22 It seems an objection, that the gospel
   had been preached to them for this end, that they might be condemned to
   die by wicked men; but this had been expressly stated before, in 1
   Peter 2:21: "For even hereunto, (that is, suffering, mentioned in the
   former verse) were ye called;" or, "For to this end ye have been
   called." Then Christ in his suffering is mentioned as one whom they
   ought to follow. There is no other view so consistent with the whole
   tenor of the Apostle's argument. -- Ed.

   [46] There is no ground to suppose, as Hammond, Macknight, and some
   others have supposed, that "the end of all things" was the end of the
   Jews as a nation, the destruction of the temple and its worship. And it
   is strange that such a notion should be entertained, especially when we
   consider that the Apostle refers to the same subject in his Second
   Epistle, where the end of the world is plainly spoken of. -- Ed.

   [47] The quotation is from the Hebrew, and the sentence in the Sept. is
   evidently different. The same words are found also in James 5:20.

   [48] "Though charity, or benevolence, hides the faults of others from
   the severity of our censure, yet charity or almsgiving is totally
   unable to conceal our own from the observance of our all-righteous
   Judge. Indeed, the only cover for these, or to speak more properly, the
   discharge of all their stains, is faith, -- is the blood of Christ,
   working with repentance towards God." -- Bishop Warburton, quoted by
   Bloomfield. -- Ed.

   1 Peter 4:12-17

   12. Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
   to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:

   12. Dilecti, ne miramini quum exploramini per ignem ad probationem
   vestri, perinde ac si novum aliquid vobis obtingat:

   13. But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings;
   that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with
   exceeding joy.

   13. Sed quatenus consortes estis passionum Christi gaudere; ut in
   revelatione quoque glorie ejus gaudeatis exultantes.

   14. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
   spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil
   spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

   14. Si probris afficimini in nomine Christi, beati estis, quoniam
   Spiritus glorite et Dei super vos requiescit; secundum ipsos quidem
   contumelia afficitur, secundun vos aut em glorificatur.

   15. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an
   evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.

   15. Ne quis enim vestrum patiatur, ut homicida, aut fur, aut maleficus,
   aut cupidè rebus alienis inhians.

   16. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
   let him glorify God on this behalf.

   16. Si autem ut Christianus, ne pudefiat, imo glorificet Deum in hac
   parte.

   17. For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God:
   --

   17. Quandoquidem et tempus est, ut judicium incipiat a domo Dei:--


   12 Beloved, think it not strange, or, wonder not. There is a frequent
   mention made in this Epistle of afflictions; the cause of which we have
   elsewhere explained. But this difference is to be observed, that when
   he exhorts the faithful to patience, he sometimes speaks generally of
   troubles common to man's life; but here he speaks of wrongs done to the
   faithful for the name of Christ. And first, indeed, he reminded them
   that they ought not to have deemed it strange as for a thing sudden and
   unexpected; by which he intimates, that they ought by a long mediation
   to have been previously prepared to bear the cross. For whosoever has
   resolved to fight under Christ's banner, will not be dismayed when
   persecution happens, but, as one accustomed to it, will patiently bear
   it. That we may then be in a prepared state of mind when the waves of
   persecutions roll over us, we ought in due time to habituate ourselves
   to such an event by meditating continually on the cross.

   Moreover, he proves that the cross is useful to us by two arguments, --
   that God thus tries our faith, -- and that we become thus partakers
   with Christ. Then, in the first place, let us remember that the trial
   of our faith is most necessary, and that we ought thus willingly to
   obey God who provides for our salvation. However, the chief consolation
   is to be derived from a fellowship with Christ. Hence Peter not only
   forbids us to think it strange, when he sets this before us, but also
   bids us to rejoice. It is, indeed, a cause of joy, when God tries our
   faith by persecution; but the other joy far surpasses it, that is, when
   the Son of God allots to us the same course of life with himself, that
   he might lead us with himself to a blessed participation of heavenly
   glory. For we must bear in mind this truth, that we have the dying of
   Christ in our flesh, that his life may be manifested in us. The wicked
   also do indeed bear many afflictions; but as they are separated from
   Christ, they apprehend nothing but God's wrath and curse: thus it comes
   that sorrow and dread overwhelm them.

   Hence, then, is the whole consolation of the godly, that they are
   associates with Christ, that hereafter they may be partakers of his
   glory; for we are always to bear in mind this transition from the cross
   to the resurrection. But as this world is like a labyrinth, in which no
   end of evils appears, Peter refers to the future revelation of Christ's
   glory, as though he had said, that the day of its revelation is not to
   be overlooked, but ought to be expected. But he mentions a twofold joy,
   one which we now enjoy in hope, and the other the full fruition of
   which the coming of Christ shall bring to us; for the first is mingled
   with grief and sorrow, the second is connected with exultation. For it
   is not suitable in the midst of afflictions to think of joy, which can
   free us from all trouble; but the consolations of God moderate evils,
   so that we can rejoice at the same time.

   14 If ye be reproached He mentions reproaches, because there is often
   more bitterness in them than in the loss of goods, or in the torments
   or agonies of the body; there is therefore nothing which is more
   grievous to ingenuous minds. For we see that many who are strong to
   bear want, courageous in torments, nay, bold to meet death, do yet
   succumb under reproach. To obviate this evil, Peter pronounces those
   blessed, according to what Christ says, (Mark 8:35,) who are reproached
   for the sake of the Gospel. This is very contrary to what men commonly
   think and feel; but he gives a reason, Because the Spirit of God,
   called also the Spirit of glory, rests on them. Some read the words
   separately, "that which belongs to glory," as though the words were,
   "glory and the Spirit of God." But the former reading is more suitable
   as to the sense, and, as to language, more simple. Then Peter shews,
   that it is no hindrance to the happiness of the godly, that they
   sustain reproach for the name of Christ, because they nevertheless
   retain a complete glory in the sight of God, while the Spirit, who has
   glory ever connected with him, dwells in them. So, what seems to the
   flesh a paradox, the Spirit of God makes consistent by a sure
   perception in their minds.

   On their part This is a confirmation of the last sentence; for he
   intimates that it is enough for the godly, that the Spirit of God
   testifies that the reproaches endured for the sake of the Gospel, are
   blessed and full of glory. The wicked, however, attempted to effect a
   far different object; as though he had said, "Ye can boldly despise the
   insolence of the ungodly, because the testimony respecting your glory,
   which God's Spirit gives you, remains fixed within." And he says that
   the Spirit of God was reproached, because the unbelieving expose to
   ridicule whatever he suggests and dictates for our consolation. But
   this is by anticipation; for however the world in its blindness may see
   nothing but what is disgraceful in the reproaches of Christ, he would
   not have the eyes of the godly to be dazzled with this false opinion;
   but on the contrary they ought to look up to God. Thus he does not
   conceal what men commonly think; but he sets the hidden perception of
   faith, which God's children possess in their own hearts, in opposition
   to their presumption and insolence. Thus Paul boasted that he had the
   marks of Christ, and he gloried in his bonds. (Galatians 6:17.) He had
   at the same time sufficiently found out what was the judgment formed of
   them by the world; and yet he intimates that it thought foolishly, and
   that those are blind together with the world, who esteem the slanders
   of the flesh glorious.

   15. But (or, For) let one of you Here also he anticipates an objection.
   He had exhorted the faithful to patience, if it happened to them to be
   persecuted for the cause of Christ; he now adds the reason why he had
   only spoken of that kind of trouble, even because they ought to have
   abstained from all evil-doing. Here, then, is contained another
   exhortation, lest they should do anything for which they might seem to
   be justly punished. Therefore the causal particle is not, here
   superfluous, since the Apostle wished to give a reason why he so much
   exhorted the faithful to a fellowship with the sufferings of Christ,
   and at the same time to remind them by the way to live justly and
   harmlessly, lest they should bring on themselves a just punishment
   through their own faults; as though he had said, that it behoved
   Christians to deserve well of all, even when they were badly and
   cruelly treated by the world.

   Were any one to object and say, that no one can be found to be so
   innocent but that he deserves for many faults to be chastised by God;
   to this I reply, that Peter here speaks of sins from which we ought to
   be entirely freed, such as thefts and murders; and I give further this
   reply, that the Apostle commands Christians to be such as they ought to
   be. It, is, then, no wonder, that he points out a difference between us
   and the children of this world, who being without God's Spirit, abandon
   themselves to every kind of wickedness. He would not have God's
   children to be in the same condition, so as to draw on themselves by a
   wicked life the punishment allotted by the laws. But we have already
   said elsewhere, that though there are always many sins in the elect,
   which God might justly punish, yet according to his paternal indulgence
   he spares his own children, so that he does not inflict the punishment
   they deserve, and that in the meantime, for honour's sake, he adorns
   them with his own tokens and those of his Christ, when he suffers them
   to be afflicted for the testimony of the Gospel.

   The word allotrioepiskopos seems to me to designate one who covets what
   belongs to another. For they who gape after plunder or fraud, inquire
   into affairs of others with tortuous or crooked eyes, as Horace says;
   [49] but the despiser of money, as the same says elsewhere, looks on
   vast heaps of gold with a straight eye. [50]

   16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian After having forbidden the
   Christians to do any hurt or harm, lest for their evil deeds, like the
   unbelieving, they should become hateful to the world, he now bids them
   to give thanks to God, if they suffered persecutions for the name of
   Christ. And truly it is no common kindness from God, that he calls us,
   freed and exempted from the common punishment of our sins, to so
   honorable a warfare as to undergo for the testimony of his Gospel
   either exiles, or prisons, or reproaches, or even death itself. Then he
   intimates that those are ungrateful to God, who clamor or murmur on
   account of persecutions, as though they were unworthily dealt with,
   since on the contrary they ought to regard it as gain and to
   acknowledge God's favor.

   But when he says, as a Christian, he regards not so much the name as
   the cause. It is certain that the adversaries of Christ omitted nothing
   in order to degrade the Gospel. Therefore, whatever reproachful words
   they made use of, it was enough for the faithful, that they suffered
   for nothing else but for the defense of the Gospel.

   On this behalf, or, In this respect. For since all afflictions derive
   their origin from sin, this thought ought to occur to the godly, "I am
   indeed worthy to be visited by the Lord with this and even with greater
   punishment for my sins; but now he would have me to suffer for
   righteousness, as though I were innocent." For how much soever the
   saints may acknowledge their own faults, yet as in persecutions they
   regard a different end, such as the Lord sets before them, they feel
   that their guilt is blotted out and abolished before God. On this
   behalf, then, they have reason to glorify God.

   17 For the time is come, or, Since also the time is come. He amplifies
   the consolation, which the goodness of the cause for which we suffer
   brings to us, while we are afflicted for the name of Christ. For this
   necessity, he says, awaits the whole Church of God, not only to be
   subject to the common miseries of men, but especially and mainly to be
   chastised by the hand of God. Then, with more submission, ought
   persecutions for Christ to be endured. For except we desire to be
   blotted out from the number of the faithful, we must submit our backs
   to the scourges of God. Now, it is a sweet consolation, that God does
   not execute his judgments on us as on others, but that he makes us the
   representatives of his own Son, when we do not suffer except for his
   cause and for his name.

   Moreover, Peter took this sentence from the common and constant
   teaching of Scripture; and this seems more probable to me than that a
   certain passage, as some think, is referred to. It was formerly usual
   with the Lord, as all the prophets witness, to exhibit the first
   examples of his chastisements in his own people, as the head of a
   family corrects his own children rather than those of strangers.
   (Isaiah 10:12.) For though God is the judge of the whole world, yet he
   would have his providence to be especially acknowledged in the
   government of his own Church. Hence, when he declares that he would
   rise up to be the judge of the whole world, he adds that this would be
   after he had completed his work on Mount Sion. He indeed puts forth his
   hand indifferently against his own people and against strangers; for we
   see that both are in common subjected to adversities; and if a
   comparison be made, he seems in a manner to spare the reprobate, and to
   be severe towards the elect. Hence the complaints of the godly, that
   the wicked pass their life in continual pleasures, and delight
   themselves with wine and the harp, and at length descend without pains
   in an instant into the grave -- that fatness covers their eyes -- that
   they are exempt from troubles -- that they securely and joyfully spend
   their life, looking down with contempt on others, so that they dare to
   set their mouth against heaven. (Job 21:13; Psalm 73:3-9.) In short,
   God so regulates his judgments in this world, that he fattens the
   wicked for the day of slaughter. He therefore passes by their many
   sins, and, as it were, connives at them. In the meantime, he restores
   by corrections his own children, for whom he has a care, to the right
   way, whenever they depart from it.

   In this sense it is that Peter says that judgment begins at the house
   of God; for judgment includes all those punishments which the Lord
   inflicts on men for their sins, and whatever refers to the reformation
   of the world.

   But why does he say that it was now the time? He means, as I think,
   what the prophets declare concerning his own time, that it especially
   belonged to Christ's kingdom, that the beginning of the reformation
   should be in the Church. Hence Paul says that Christians, without the
   hope of a resurrection, would of all men be the most miserable, (1
   Corinthians 15:19;) and justly so, because, while others indulge
   themselves without fear, the faithful continually sigh and groan; while
   God connives at the sins of others, and suffers them to continue
   torpid, he deals rigidly with his own people, and subjects them to the
   discipline of the cross.

   1 Peter 4:17-19

   17. -- And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that
   obey not the gospel of God?

   17. -- Si autem primum a nobis, quis finis eorum qui non obediunt
   evangelio Dei?

   18. And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and
   the sinner appear?

   18. Et si justus vix servatur, impius et peccator ubi apparebunt?

   19. Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit
   the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful
   Creator.

   19. Itaque qui patiuntur secundum Dei voluntatem, tanquam fideli
   possessori commendent animas suas benefaciendo.


   When the faithful see that it is well with the wicked, they are
   necessarily tempted to be envious; and this is a very dangerous trial;
   for present happiness is what all desire. Hence the Spirit of God
   carefully dwells on this, in many places, as well as in the
   thirty-seventh Psalm, lest the faithful should envy the prosperity of
   the ungodly. The same is what Peter speaks of, for he shews that
   afflictions ought to be calmly borne by the children of God, when they
   compare the lot of others with their own. But he takes it as granted
   that God is the judge of the world, and that, therefore, no one can
   escape his hand with impunity. He hence infers, that a dreadful
   vengeance will soon overtake those whose condition seems now favorable.
   The design of what he says, as I have already stated, is to shew that
   the children of God should not faint under the bitterness of present
   evils, but that they ought, on the contrary, calmly to bear their
   afflictions for a short time, as the issue will be salvation, while the
   ungodly will have to exchange a fading and fleeting prosperity for
   eternal perdition.

   But the argument is from the less to the greater; for if God spares not
   his own children whom he loves and who obey him, how dreadful will be
   his severity against enemies and such as are rebellious! There is,
   then, nothing better than to obey the Gospel, so that God may kindly
   correct us by his paternal hand for our salvation.

   18 And if the righteous It has been thought that this sentence is taken
   from Proverbs 11:31; for the Greek translators have thus rendered what
   Solomon says,

   "Behold, the just shall on the earth be recompensed; how much more the
   ungodly and the sinner?"

   Now, whether Peter intended to quote this passage, or repeated a common
   and a proverbial saying, (which seems to me more probable,) [51] the
   meaning is, that God's judgment would be dreadful against the ungodly,
   since the way to salvation was so thorny and difficult to the elect.
   And this is said, lest we should securely indulge ourselves, but
   carefully proceed in our course, and lest we should also seek the
   smooth and easy road, the end of which is a terrible precipice.

   But when he says, that a righteous man is scarcely saved, he refers to
   the difficulties of the present life, for our course in the world is
   like a dangerous sailing between many rocks, and exposed to many storms
   and tempests; and thus no one arrives at the port, except he who has
   escaped from [a] thousand deaths. It is in the meantime certain that we
   are guided by God's hand, and that we are in no danger of shipwreck as
   long as we have him as our pilot.

   Absurd, then, are those interpreters who think that we shall be hardly
   and with difficulty saved, when we shall come before God in judgment;
   for it is the present and not the future time that Peter refers to; nor
   does he speak of God's strictness or rigour, but shews how many and
   what arduous difficulties must be surmounted by the Christian before he
   reaches the goal. Sinner here means a wicked man [52] and the righteous
   are not those who are altogether perfect in righteousness, but who
   strive to live righteously.

   19 Wherefore let them that suffer He draws this conclusion, that
   persecutions ought to be submissively endured, for the condition of the
   godly in them is much happier than that of the unbelieving, who enjoy
   prosperity to their utmost wishes. He, however, reminds us that we
   suffer nothing except according to the permission of God, which tends
   much to comfort us; when he says, Let them commit themselves to God, it
   is the same as though he had said, "Let them deliver themselves and
   their life to the safe keeping of God." And he calls him a faithful
   possessor, because he faithfully keeps and defends whatever is under
   his protection or power. Some render the word "Creator;" and the term
   ktistes means both; but the former meaning I prefer, for by bidding us
   to deposit our life with God, he makes him its safe keeper. He adds, in
   well-doing, lest the faithful should retaliate the wrongs done to them,
   but that they might on the contrary contend with the ungodly, who
   injured them, by well-doing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [51] It certainly appears as a quotation, as the words are literally
   the same. It is to be observed that the Hebrew has "on earth," which
   seems to confirm the view that saved here refers to deliverances from
   the troubles, trials, and persecutions, which the righteous have to go
   through during life; and that scarcely, or hardly, or with difficulty,
   as rendered by Doddridge and Macknight, is to be limited to the time of
   the Christian's course in this world; for, as Macknight observes, the
   Apostle speaks in his Second Epistle of an abundant entrance into the
   heavenly kingdom being vouchsafed to all faithful Christians. See 2
   Peter 1:11 -- Ed.

   [52] The two words, "ungodly," asebes, and "sinner," amartolos, exactly
   correspond with rs and chvt' in Hebrew; the first is he who is not
   pious, not a worshipper of God, having neither fear nor love towards
   him; and the second is the wicked, and open and shameless transgressor,
   who regards not what is just and right. Grotius says, that the first is
   he who shews no piety towards God; and that the second is one who
   observes no justice towards man. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Peter 5:1-4

   1. The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a
   witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory
   that shall be revealed:

   1. Presbyteros qui inter vos sunt, hortor ego qui simul sum presbyter,
   et testis passionum Christi, et gloriae qum revelabitur particeps:

   2. Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
   thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of
   a ready mind;

   2. Pascite, quantum in vobis est, gregem Dei (vel, Christi, vel,
   Domini,) episcopatu fungentes, non coactè, sed voluntariè; neque turpis
   lucri causâ, sed liberaliter;

   3. Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to
   the flock.

   3. Nec tanquam dominium exercentes adversus cleros, sed ut sitis
   exemplaria gregis.

   4. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown
   of glory that fadeth not away.

   4. Et quum apparuerit Princeps pastorum, reportabitis immarcescibilem
   gloriae coronam.


   In exhorting pastors to their duty, he points out especially three
   vices which are found to prevail much, even sloth, desire of gain, and
   lust for power. In opposition to the first vice he sets alacrity or a
   willing attention; to the second, liberality; to the third, moderation
   and meekness, by which they are to keep themselves in their own rank or
   station.

   He then says that pastors ought not to exercise care over the flock of
   the Lord, as far only as they are constrained; for they who seek to do
   no more than what constraint compels them, do their work formally and
   negligently. Hence he would have them to do willingly what they do, as
   those who are really devoted to their work. To correct avarice, he bids
   them to perform their office with a ready mind; for whosoever has not
   this end in view, to spend himself and his labor disinterestedly and
   gladly in behalf of the Church, is not a minister of Christ, but a
   slave to his own stomach and his purse. The third vice which he
   condemns is a lust for exercising power or dominion. But it may be
   asked, what kind of power does he mean? This, as it seems to me, may be
   gathered from the opposite clause, in which he bids them to be examples
   to the flock. It is the same as though he had said that they are to
   preside for this end, to be eminent in holiness, which cannot be,
   except they humbly subject themselves and their life to the same common
   rule. What stands opposed to this virtue is tyrannical pride, when the
   pastor exempts himself from all subjection, and tyrannizes over the
   Church. It was for this that Ezekiel condemned the false prophets, that
   is, that they ruled cruelly and tyrannically. (Ezekiel 34:4.) Christ
   also condemned the Pharisees, because they laid intolerable burdens on
   the shoulders of the people which they would not touch, no, not with a
   finger. (Matthew 23:4.) This imperious rigour, then, which ungodly
   pastors exercise over the Church, cannot be corrected, except their
   authority be restrained, so that they may rule in such a way as to
   afford an example of a godly life.

   1 The elders By this name he designates pastors and all those who are
   appointed for the government of the Church. But they called them
   presbyters or elders for honor's sake, not because they were all old in
   age, but because they were principally chosen from the aged, for old
   age for the most part has more prudence, gravity, and experience. But
   as sometimes hoariness is not wisdom, according to a Greek proverb, and
   as young men are found more fit, such as Timothy, these were also
   usually called presbyters, after having been chosen into that order.
   Since Peter calls himself in like manner a presbyter, it appears that
   it was a common name, which is still more evident from many other
   passages. Moreover, by this title he secured for himself more
   authority, as though he had said that he had a right to admonish
   pastors, because he was one of themselves, for there ought to be mutual
   liberty between colleagues. But if he had the right of primacy he would
   have claimed it; and this would have been most suitable on the present
   occasion. But though he was an Apostle, he yet knew that authority was
   by no means delegated to him over his colleagues, but that on the
   contrary he was joined with the rest in the participation of the same
   office.

   A witness of the sufferings of Christ This may be explained of
   doctrine, yet I prefer to regard it as referring to his own life. At
   the same time both may be admitted; but I am more disposed to embrace
   the latter view, because these two clauses will be more in harmony, --
   that Peter speaks of the sufferings of Christ in his own flesh, and
   that he would be also a partaker of his glory. For the passage agrees
   with that of Paul, "If we suffer together, we shall also reign
   together." Besides, it avails much to make us believe his words, that
   he gave a proof of his faith by enduring the cross. For it hence
   appears evident that he spoke in earnest; and the Lord, by thus proving
   his people, seals as it were their ministry, that it might have more
   honor and reverence among men. Peter, then, had probably this in view,
   so that he might be heard as the faithful minister of Christ, a proof
   of which he gave in the persecutions he had suffered, and in the hope
   which he had of future life. [53]

   But we must observe that Peter confidently declares that he would be a
   partaker of that glory which was not yet revealed; for it is the
   character of faith to acquiesce in hidden blessings.

   2 Feed the flock of God We hence learn what the word presbyter imports,
   even that it includes the office of feeding. It is for a far different
   end that the Pope makes presbyters, even that they may daily slay
   Christ, there being no mention made of feeding in their ordination. Let
   us then remember to distinguish between the institution of Christ and
   the confusion of the Pope, it being as different as light is from
   darkness. Let us also bear in mind the definition given of the word;
   for the flock of Christ cannot be fed except with pure doctrine, which
   is alone our spiritual food.

   Hence pastors are not mute hypocrites, nor those who spread their own
   figments, which, like deadly poison, destroy the souls of men.

   The words, as much as it is in you, mean the same as though he had
   said, "Apply all your strength to this very thing, and whatever power
   God has conferred on you." The old interpreter has given this
   rendering, "Which is among you;" and this may be the sense of the
   words: more correct, however, is the rendering of Erasmus, which I have
   followed, though I do not reject nor disapprove of the other. [54]

   The flock of God, or, of the Lord, or, of Christ: it matters little
   which you take, for the three readings are found in different copies.
   [55]

   Taking the oversight, or, discharging the office of a bishop. Erasmus
   renders the words, "Taking care of it," (curam illius agentes;) but as
   the Greek word is episkopountes I doubt not but that Peter meant to set
   forth the office and title of the episcopate. We may learn also from
   other parts of Scripture that these two names, bishop and presbyter,
   are synonymous. He then shews how they were rightly to perform the
   pastoral office, though the word episkopein generally means to preside
   or to oversee. What I have rendered "not constraintally," is literally,
   "not necessarily;" for when we act according to what necessity
   prescribes, we proceed in our work slowly and frigidly, as it were by
   constraint.

   3 Neither as being lords, or, as exercising dominion. The preposition
   kata in Greek is taken, for the most part, in a bad sense: then Peter
   here condemns unreasonable exercise of power, as the case is with those
   who consider not themselves to be the ministers of Christ and his
   Church, but seek something higher. And he calls particular churches
   "lots," (cleros;) for as the whole body of the Church is the Lord's
   heritage, so the churches, scattered through towns and villages, were
   as so many farms, the culture of which he assigns to each presbyter.
   Some very ignorantly think that those called clergy are meant here. It
   was, indeed, an ancient way of speaking, to call the whole order of
   ministers, clergy; but I wish that it had never occurred to the Fathers
   to speak thus; for what Scripture ascribes in common to the whole
   Church, it was by no means right to confine to a few men. And this way
   of speaking was spurious, at least it was a departure from apostolic
   usage.

   Peter, indeed, expressly gives the churches this title, in order that
   we may know that whatever men ascribe to themselves is taken away from
   the Lord, as in many places he calls the Church his peculiar treasure,
   and the rod of his heritage, when he intends to claim his entire
   dominion over it; for he never delivers to pastors the government, but
   only the care, so that his own right remains still complete.

   4 When the chief Shepherd shall appear Except pastors retain this end
   in view, it can by no means be that they will in good earnest proceed
   in the course of their calling, but will, on the contrary, become often
   faint; for there are innumerable hindrances which are sufficient to
   discourage the most prudent. They have often to do with ungrateful men,
   from whom they receive an unworthy reward; long and great labors are
   often in vain; Satan sometimes prevails in his wicked devices. Lest,
   then, the faithful servant of Christ should be broken down, there is
   for him one and only one remedy, -- to turn his eyes to the coming of
   Christ. Thus it will be, that he, who seems to derive no encouragement
   from men, will assiduously go on in his labors, knowing that a great
   reward is prepared for him by the Lord. And further, lest a protracted
   expectation should produce languor, he at the same time sets forth the
   greatness of the reward, which is sufficient to compensate for all
   delay: An unfading crown of glory, he says, awaits you.

   It ought also to be observed, that he calls Christ the chief Pastor;
   for we are to rule the Church under him and in his name, in no other
   way but that he should be still really the Pastor. So the word chief
   here does not only mean the principal, but him whose power all others
   ought to submit to, as they do not represent him except according to
   his command and authority.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [53] The most obvious meaning is, that Peter had been an eye-witness of
   Christ's sufferings. So the word "witness" is taken by Grotius,
   Macknight, Doddridge, and Scott. -- Ed.

   [54] The Vulgate, called here and elsewhere, "the old interpreter,"
   seems to be the most correct, as viewed by most critics. The same form
   of words is found in the first verse, "The elders who are among you."
   -- Ed.

   [55] By far the most approved reading is "of God." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Peter 5:5-7

   5. Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of
   you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God
   resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

   5. Similiter juniores, subjecti estote senioribus; sic et omnes, alii
   allis subjiciamini; humilitatem animi induite; propterea quod Deus
   superbis resistit, humilibus vero dat gratiam.

   6. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he
   may exalt you in due time:

   6. Humiliamini ergo sub potenti manu Dei, ut vos extollat quum erit
   opportunum;

   7. Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

   7. Omni cura vestra in eum conjecta; quoniam illi cura est vestri.


   5 Likewise, ye younger The word elder is put here in a sense different
   from what it had before; for it is necessary, when a contrast is made
   between them and the younger, that the two clauses should correspond.
   Then he refers to the elders in age, having before spoken of the
   office; and thus he comes from the particular to the general. And in
   short, he bids every one that is inferior in age to obey the counsels
   of the elders, and to be teachable and humble; for the age of youth is
   inconstant, and requires a bridle. Besides, pastors could not have
   performed their duty, except this reverential feeling prevailed and was
   cultivated, so that the younger suffered themselves to be ruled; for if
   there be no subjection, government is overturned. When they have no
   authority who ought by right or order of nature to rule, all will
   immediately become insolently wanton.

   Yea, all He shews the reason why the younger ought to submit to the
   elder, even that there might be an equable state of things and due
   order among them. For, when authority is granted to the elders, there
   is not given them the right or the liberty of throwing off the bridle,
   but they are also themselves to be under due restraint, so that there
   may be a mutual subjection. So the husband is the head of the wife, and
   yet he in his turn is to be in some things subject to her. So the
   father has authority over his children, and still he is not exempt from
   all subjection, but something is due to them. The same thing, also, is
   to be thought of others. In short, all ranks in society have to defend
   the whole body, which cannot be done, except all the members are joined
   together by the bond of mutual subjection. Nothing is more adverse to
   the disposition of man than subjection. For it was formerly very truly
   said, that every one has within him the soul of a king. Until, then,
   the high spirits, with which the nature of men swells, are subdued, no
   man will give way to another; but, on the contrary, each one, despising
   others, will claim all things for himself.

   Hence the Apostle, in order that humility may dwell among us, wisely
   reproves this haughtiness and pride. And the metaphor he uses is very
   appropriate, as though he had said, "Surround yourselves with humility
   on every side, as with a garment which covers the whole body." He yet
   intimates that no ornament is more beautiful or more becoming, than
   when we submit one to another.

   For, or, because. It is a most grievous threatening, when he says, that
   all who seek to elevate themselves, shall have God as their enemy, who
   will lay them low. But, on the contrary, he says of the humble, that
   God will be propitious and favorable to them. We are to imagine that;
   God has two hands; the one, which like a hammer beats down and breaks
   in pieces those who raise up themselves; and the other, which raises up
   the humble who willingly let down themselves, and is like a firm prop
   to sustain them. Were we really convinced of this, and had it deeply
   fixed in our minds, who of us would dare by pride to urge war with God?
   But the hope of impunity now makes us fearlessly to raise up our horn
   to heaven. Let, then, this declaration of Peter be as a celestial
   thunderbolt to make men humble.

   But he calls those humble, who being emptied of every confidence in
   their own power, wisdom, and righteousness, seek every good from God
   alone. Since there is no coming to God except in this way, who, having
   lost his own glory, ought not willingly to humble himself?

   6 Humble yourselves therefore. We must ever bear in mind for what end
   he bids us to be humble before God, even that we may be more courteous
   and kind to our brethren, and not refuse to submit to them as far as
   love demands. Then they who are haughty and refractory towards men,
   are, he says, acting insolently towards God. He therefore exhorts all
   the godly to submit to God's authority; and he calls God's power his
   hand, that he might make them to fear the more. For though hand is
   often applied to God, yet it is to be understood here according to the
   circumstances of the passage. But as we are wont commonly to fear, lest
   our humility should be a disadvantage to us, and others might for this
   reason grow more insolent, Peter meets this objection, and promises
   eminency to all who humble themselves.

   But he adds, in due time, that he might at the same time obviate too
   much haste. He then intimates that it is necessary for us to learn
   humility now, but that the Lord well knows when it is expedient for us
   to be elevated. Thus it behoves us to yield to his counsel.

   7 Casting all our care He more fully sets forth here the providence of
   God. For whence are these proverbial sayings, "We shall have to howl
   among wolves," and, "They are foolish who are like sheep, exposing
   themselves to wolves to be devoured," except that we think that by our
   humility we set loose the reins to the audacity of the ungodly, so that
   they insult us more wantonly? But this fear arises from our ignorance
   of divine providence. Now, on the other hand, as soon as we are
   convinced that God cares for us, our minds are easily led to patience
   and humility. Lest, then, the wickedness of men should tempt us to a
   fierceness of mind, the Apostle prescribes to us a remedy, and also
   David does in the thirty-seventh Psalm, so that having cast our care on
   God, we may calmly rest. For all those who recumb not on God's
   providence must necessarily be in constant turmoil and violently assail
   others. We ought the more to dwell on this thought, that God cares for
   us, in order, first, that we may have peace within; and, secondly, that
   we may be humble and meek towards men.

   But we are not thus bidden to cast all our care on God, as though God
   wished us to have strong hearts, and to be void of all feeling; but
   lest fear or anxiety should drive us to impatience. In like manner, the
   knowledge of divine providence does not free men from every care, that
   they may securely indulge themselves; for it ought not to encourage the
   torpidity of the flesh, but to bring rest to faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Peter 5:8-11

   8. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
   roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

   8. Sobrii estote, vigilate, quia adversarius vester diabolus, tanquam
   leo rugiens, circuit, quaerens quem devoret (vel, quempiam devorare;)

   9. Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions
   are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.

   9. Cui resistite firmi fide, scientes easdem passiones, vestrae quae in
   mundo fraternitati adimpleri.

   10. But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory
   by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect,
   stablish, strengthen, settle you:

   10. Deus autera omnis gratiae, qui nos vocavit in aeternam suam gloriam
   per Christum Jesum, paulisper afflictos ipse vos perficiat, confirmet,
   corroboret, stabiliat:

   11. To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

   11. Ei gloria et imperium in secula seculorum. Amen.


   8 Be sober This explanation extends wider, that as we have war with a
   most fierce and most powerful enemy, we are to be strenuous in
   resisting him. But he uses a twofold metaphor, that they were to be
   sober, and that they were to exercise watchfulness. Surfeiting produces
   sloth and sleep; even so they who indulge in earthly cares and
   pleasures, think of nothing else, being under the power of spiritual
   lethargy.

   We now perceive what the meaning of the Apostle is. We must, he says,
   carry on a warfare in this world; and he reminds us that we have to do
   with no common enemy, but one who, like a lion, runs here and there,
   ready to devour. He hence concludes that we ought carefully to watch.
   Paul stimulates us with the same argument in the sixth chapter of the
   Epistle to the Ephesians, where he says that we have a contest not with
   flesh and blood, but with spiritual wickedness, etc. But we too often
   turn peace into sloth, and hence it comes that the enemy then
   circumvents and overwhelms us; for, as though placed beyond the reach
   of danger, we indulge ourselves according to the will of the flesh.

   He compares the devil to a lion, as though he had said, that he is a
   savage wild beast. He says that he goes round to devour, in order to
   rouse us to wariness. He calls him the adversary of the godly, that
   they might know that they worship God and profess faith in Christ on
   this condition, that they are to have continual war with the devil, for
   he does not spare the members who fights with the head.

   9 Whom resist As the power of an enemy ought to stimulate us and make
   us more careful, so there would be danger lest our hearts failed
   through immoderate fear, except the hope of victory were given us. This
   then is what the Apostle speaks of; he shows that the issue of the war
   will be prosperous, if we indeed fight under the banner of Christ; for
   whosoever comes to this contest, endued with faith, he declares that he
   will certainly be a conqueror.

   Resist, he says; but some one may ask, how? To this he answers, there
   is sufficient strength in faith. Paul, in the passage which I have
   already quoted, enumerates the various parts of our armor, but the
   meaning is the same, (Ephesians 6:13,) for John testifies that faith
   alone is our victory over the world.

   Knowing that the same afflictions, or sufferings. It is another
   consolation, that we have a contest in common with all the children of
   God; for Satan dangerously tries us, when he separates us from the body
   of Christ. We have heard how he attempted to storm the courage of Job,

   "Look to the saints, has any one of them suffered such a thing?"
   -- Job 5:1.

   The Apostle on the other hand, reminds us here that nothing happens to
   us but what we see does happen to other members of the Church. Moreover
   a fellowship, or a similar condition, with all the saints, ought by no
   means to be refused by us.

   By saying that the same sufferings are accomplished, he means what Paul
   declares in Colossians 1:24, that what remains of the sufferings of
   Christ is daily fulfilled in the faithful.

   The words, that are in the world, may be explained in two ways, either
   that God proves his faithful people indiscriminately everywhere in the
   world, or that the necessity of fighting awaits us as long as we are in
   the world. But we must observe that having said before that we are
   assailed by Satan, he then immediately refers to every kind of
   afflictions. We hence gather that we have always to do with our
   spiritual enemy, however adversities may come, or whatever they may be,
   whether diseases oppress us, or the barrenness of the land threatens us
   with famine, or men persecute us.

   10 But the God of all grace After having sufficiently dwelt on
   admonitions, he now turns to prayer; for doctrine is in vain poured
   forth into the air, unless God works by his Spirit. And this example
   ought to be followed by all the ministers of God, that is, to pray that
   he may give success to their labors; for otherwise they effect nothing
   either by planting or by watering.

   Some copies have the future tense, as though a promise is made; but the
   other reading is more commonly received. At the same time, the Apostle,
   by praying God, confirms those to whom he was writing, for when he
   calls God the author of all grace, and reminds them that they were
   called to eternal glory, his purpose no doubt was, to confirm them in
   the conviction, that the work of their salvation, which he had begun,
   would be completed.

   He is called the God of all grace from the effect, from the gifts he
   bestows, according to the Hebrew manner. [56] And he mentions expressly
   all grace, first that they might learn that every blessing is to be
   ascribed to God; and secondly, that one grace is connected with
   another, so that they might hope in future for the addition of those
   graces in which they were hitherto wanting.

   Who hath called us This, as I have said, serves to increase confidence,
   because God is led not only by his goodness, but also by his gracious
   benevolence, to aid us more and more. He does not simply mention
   calling, but he shews wherefore they were called, even that they might
   obtain eternal glory. He further fixes the foundation of calling in
   Christ. Both these things serve to give perpetual confidence, for if
   our calling is founded on Christ, and refers to the celestial kingdom
   of God and a blessed immortality, it follows that it is not transient
   nor fading.

   It may also be right, by the way, to observe that when he says that we
   are called in Christ, first, our calling is established, because it is
   rightly founded; and secondly, that all respect to our worthiness and
   merit is excluded; for that God, by the preaching of the gospel,
   invites us to himself, it is altogether gratuitous; and it is still a
   greater grace that he efficaciously touches our hearts so as to lead us
   to obey his voice. Now Peter especially addresses the faithful; he
   therefore connects the efficacious power of the Spirit with the outward
   doctrine.

   As to the three words which follow, some copies have them in the
   ablative case, which may be rendered in Latin by gerunds (fulciendo,
   roborando, stabiliendo) by supporting, by strengthening, by
   establishing. [57] But in this there is not much importance with regard
   to the meaning. Besides, Peter intends the same thing by all these
   words, even to confirm the faithful; and he uses these several words
   for this purpose, that we may know that to follow our course is a
   matter of no common difficulty, and that therefore we need the special
   grace of God. The words suffered a while, inserted here, shew that the
   time of suffering is but short, and this is no small consolation.

   11 To him be glory That he might add more confidence to the godly, he
   breaks out into thanksgiving. Though this be read in the indicative as
   well as in the optative mood, still the meaning is nearly the same.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [56] We read in 1 Peter 4:10, of "the manifold grace of God," which may
   be viewed as explanatory of "the God of all grace." -- Ed.

   [57] It seems that the preponderance as to readings is in favor of this
   construction, for Griesbach has introduced into his text these three
   words as nouns, sterixei, sthenosei, themeliosei, but it is a harsh
   construction. The probability is, that this reading has been introduced
   because of the sense, as it was not seen how these words could come
   after "make perfect." But the order is according to the usual style of
   the prophets, examples of which are also found in the New Testament:
   the ultimate object is mentioned first, and then what leads to it. The
   writer, as it were, retrogrades instead of going forward. See on this
   subject the preface to the third volume of Calvin's Commentaries on
   Jeremiah. Divested of this peculiarity, the words would run thus: "may
   he establish, strengthen, confirm, perfect you;" that is, to give the
   words more literally, "may he put you on a solid foundation, render you
   strong, render you firm, make you perfect." -- Ed.

   of God wherein ye stand.

   12. Per Silvanum vobis fidum fratrem (ut arbitror) paucis scripsi,

   you; and so doth Marcus my son.

   13. Salutat vos quae in Babylone est Ecclesia, simul vobiscum electa,
   et Marcus filius meus.

   14. Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all
   that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

   14. Salutate vos invicem in osculo charitatis. Gratia vobis omnibus qui
   estis in Christo Jesu.


   12 By Silvanus He exhorts them at the conclusion of the Epistle to
   constancy in the faith: yea, he declares that his design in writing,
   was to retain them in obedience to the doctrine which they had
   embraced. But he first commends the brevity of his Epistle, lest the
   reading of it should be tedious to them; and, secondly, he adds a short
   commendation of his messenger, that the living voice might be added to
   what was written; for this was the design of the testimony he bears to
   his fidelity. But the exception, as I suppose, or think, was added,
   either as token of modesty or to let them surely know, that he spoke
   according to the conviction of his own mind; and it was unreasonable
   for them not to assent to the judgment of so great an apostle.

   Exhorting and testifying How difficult it is to continue in the faith!
   evidences of this are the daily defections of many: nor, indeed, is
   such a thing to be wondered at, when we consider how great is the
   levity and inconsistency of men, and how great is their inclination to
   vanity. But as no doctrine can strike firm and perpetual roots in men's
   hearts, if it be accompanied with any doubt, he testifies that God's
   truth, in which they had been taught, was certain. And, doubtless,
   except its certainty appears to our minds, we must at all times
   necessarily vacillate, and be ready to turn at every wind of new
   doctrine. By the grace of God, he means faith with all its effects and
   fruits.

   13 That is at Babylon Many of the ancients thought that Rome is here
   enigmatically denoted. This comment the Papists gladly lay hold on,
   that Peter may appear to have presided over the Church of Rome: nor
   does the infamy of the name deter them, provided they can pretend to
   the title of an apostolic seat; nor do they care for Christ, provided
   Peter be left to them. Moreover, let them only retain the name of
   Peter's chair, and they will not refuse to set Rome in the infernal
   regions. But this old comment has no color of truth in its favor; nor
   do I see why it was approved by Eusebius and others, except that they
   were already led astray by that error, that Peter had been at Rome.
   Besides, they are inconsistent with themselves. They say that Mark died
   at Alexandria, in the eighth year of Nero; but they imagine that Peter,
   six years after this, was put to death at Rome by Nero. If Mark formed,
   as they say, the Alexandrian Church, and had been long a bishop there,
   he could never have been at Rome with Peter. For Eusebius and Jerome
   extend the time of Peter's presidency at Rome to twenty-five years; but
   this may be easily disproved by what is said in the first and the
   second chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians.

   Since, then, Peter had Mark as his companion when he wrote this
   Epistle, it is very probable that he was at Babylon: and this was in
   accordance with his calling; for we know that he was appointed an
   apostle especially to the Jews. He therefore visited chiefly those
   parts where there was the greatest number of that nation.

   In saying that the Church there was a partaker of the same election,
   his object was to confirm others more and more in the faith; for it was
   a great matter that the Jews were gathered into the Church, in so
   remote a part of the world.

   My son So he calls Mark for honor's sake; the reason, however, is,
   because he had begotten him in the faith, as Paul did Timothy.

   Of the kiss of love we have spoken elsewhere. Now he bids this to be
   the kiss of love, [58] so that the sincerity of the heart might
   correspond with the external act.

   THE ARGUMENT

   This Epistle is altogether worthy of the spirit of that disciple who,
   above others, was loved by Christ, that he might exhibit him as a
   friend to us. But it contains doctrines mixed with exhortations; for he
   speaks of the eternal Deity of Christ, and at the same time of the
   incomparable grace which he brought with him when he appeared in the
   world, and generally of all his blessings; and he especially commends
   and extols the inestimable grace of divine adoption.

   On these truths he grounds his exhortations; and at one time he
   admonishes us in general to lead a pious and holy life, and at another
   time he expressly enjoins love. But he does none of these things in a
   regular order; for he everywhere mixes teaching with exhortation. But
   he particularly urges brotherly love: he also briefly touches on other
   things, such as to beware of impostors, and similar things. But each
   particular shall be noticed in its own place.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 John 1:1-2

   1. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
   have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have
   handled, of the Word of life;

   1. Quod erat ab initio, quod audivimus, quod vidimus oculis nostris,
   quod intuiti sumus, quod manus nostrae contrectaverunt, de Sermone
   vitae;

   2. (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness,
   and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was
   manifested unto us;)

   2. Et vita manifesta est, et vidimus et testamur et annuntiamus vobis
   vitam aeternam, quae erat apud Patrem, et manifesta est nobis.


   He shows, first, that life has been exhibited to us in Christ; which,
   as it is an incomparable good, ought to rouse and inflame all our
   powers with a marvelous desire for it, and with the love of it. It is
   said, indeed, in a few and plain words, that life is manifested; but if
   we consider how miserable and horrible a condition death is, and also
   what is the kingdom and the glory of immortality, we shall perceive
   that there is something here more magnificent than what can be
   expressed in any words.

   Then the Apostle's object, in setting before us the vast good, yea, the
   chief and only true happiness which God has conferred on us, in his own
   Son, is to raise our thoughts above; but as the greatness of the
   subject requires that the truth should be certain, and fully proved,
   this is what is here much dwelt upon. For these words, What we have
   seen, what we have heard, what we have looked on, serve to strengthen
   our faith in the gospel. Nor does he, indeed, without reason, make so
   many asseverations; for since our salvation depends on the gospel, its
   certainty is in the highest degree necessary; and how difficult it is
   for us to believe, every one of us knows too well by his own
   experience. To believe is not lightly to form an opinion, or to assent
   only to what is said, but a firm, undoubting conviction, so that we may
   dare to subscribe to the truth as fully proved. It is for this reason
   that the Apostle heaps together so many things in confirmation of the
   gospel.

   1 That which was from the beginning As the passage is abrupt and
   involved, that the sense may be made clearer, the words may be thus
   arranged; "We announce to you the word of life, which was from the
   beginning and really testified to us in all manner of ways, that life
   has been manifested in him;" or, if you prefer, the meaning may be thus
   given, "What we announce to you respecting the word of life, has been
   from the beginning, and has been openly shewed to us, that life was
   manifested in him." But the words, That which was from the beginning,
   refer doubtless to the divinity of Christ, for God manifested in the
   flesh was not from the beginning; but he who always was life and the
   eternal Word of God, appeared in the fullness of time as man. Again,
   what follows as to the looking on and the handling of the hands, refers
   to his human nature. But as the two natures constitute but one person,
   and Christ is one, because he came forth from the Father that he might
   put on our flesh, the Apostle rightly declares that he is the same, and
   had been invisible, and afterwards became visible. [59]

   Hereby the senseless cavil of Servetus is disproved, that the nature
   and essence of Deity became one with the flesh, and that thus the Word
   was transformed into flesh, because the life-giving Word was seen in
   the flesh.

   Let us then bear in mind, that this doctrine of the Gospel is here
   declared, that he who in the flesh really proved himself to be the Son
   of God, and was acknowledged to be the Son of God, was always God's
   invisible Word, for he does not refer here to the beginning of the
   world, but ascends much higher.

   Which we have heard, which we have seen. It was not the hearing of a
   report, to which little credit is usually given, but John means, that
   he had faithfully learnt from his Master those things which he taught,
   so that he alleged nothing thoughtlessly and rashly. And, doubtless, no
   one is a fit teacher in the Church, who has not been the disciple of
   the Son of God, and rightly instructed in his school, since his
   authority alone ought to prevail.

   When he says, we have seen with our eyes, it is no redundancy, but a
   fuller expression for the sake of amplifying; nay, he was not satisfied
   with seeing only, but added, which we have looked upon, and our hands
   have handled By these words he shews that he taught nothing but what
   had been really made known to him.

   It may seem, however, that the evidence of the senses little availed on
   the present subject, for the power of Christ could not be perceived by
   the eyes nor felt by the hands. To this I answer, that the same thing
   is said here as in the first chapter of the Gospel of John, "We have
   seen his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father;" for
   he was not known as the Son of God by the external form of his body,
   but because he gave illustrious proofs of his Divine power, so that in
   him shone forth the majesty of the Father, as in a living and distinct
   image. As the words are in the plural number, and the subject equally
   applies to all the apostles, I am disposed to include them, especially
   as the authority of testimony is what is treated of.

   But no less frivolous (as I have before said) than impudent is the
   wickedness of Servetus, who urges these words to prove that the Word of
   God became visible and capable of being handled; he either impiously
   destroys or mingles together the twofold nature of Christ. It is,
   therefore, a pure figment. Thus deifying the humanity of Christ, he
   wholly takes away the reality of his human nature, at the same time
   denying that Christ is for any other reason called the Son of God,
   except that he was conceived of his mother by the power of the Holy
   Spirit, and taking away his own subsistence in God. It hence follows
   that he was neither God nor man, though he seems to form a confused
   mass from both. But as the meaning of the Apostle is evident to us, let
   us pass by that unprincipled man.

   Of the Word of life The genitive here is used for an adjective,
   vivifying, or life-giving; for in him, as it is said in the first
   chapter of John's Gospel, was life. At the same time, this distinction
   belongs to the Son of God on two accounts, because he has infused life
   into all creatures, and because he now restores life to us, which had
   perished, having been extinguished by the sin of Adam. Moreover, the
   term Word may be explained in two ways, either of Christ, or of the
   doctrine of the Gospel, for even by this is salvation brought to us.
   But as its substance is Christ, and as it contains no other thing than
   that he, who had been always with the Father, was at length manifested
   to men, the first view appears to me the more simple and genuine.
   Moreover, it appears more fully from the Gospel that the wisdom which
   dwells in God is called the Word.

   2 For (or, and) the life was manifested The copulative is explanatory,
   as though he had said, "We testify of the vivifying Word, as life has
   been manifested." The sense may at the same time be twofold, that
   Christ, who is life and the fountain of life, has been manifested, or,
   that life has been openly offered to us in Christ. The latter, indeed,
   necessarily follows from the former. Yet as to the meaning, the two
   things differ, as cause and effect. When he repeats, We shew, or
   announce eternal life, he speaks, I have no doubt, of the effect, even
   that he announces that life is obtained for us in Christ.

   We hence learn, that when Christ is preached to us, the kingdom of
   heaven is opened to us, so that being raised from death we may live the
   life of God.

   Which was with the Father. This is true, not only from the time when
   the world was formed, but also from eternity, for he was always God,
   the fountain of life; and the power and the faculty of vivifying was
   possessed by his eternal wisdom: but he did not actually exercise it
   before the creation of the world, and from the time when God began to
   exhibit the Word, that power which before was hid, diffused itself over
   all created things. Some manifestation had already been made; the
   Apostle had another thing in view, that is, that life was then at
   length manifested in Christ, when he in our flesh completed the work of
   redemption. For though the fathers were even under the law associates
   and partakers of the same life, yet we know that they were shut up
   under the hope that was to be revealed. It was necessary for them to
   seek life from the death and resurrection of Christ; but the event was
   not only far remote from their eyes, but also hid from their minds.
   They depended, then, on the hope of revelation, which at length in due
   time followed. They could not, indeed, have obtained life, except it
   was in some way manifested to them; but the difference between us and
   them is, that we hold him already revealed as it were in our hands,
   whom they sought obscurely promised to them in types.

   But the object of the Apostle is, to remove the idea of novelty, which
   might have lessened the dignity of the Gospel; he therefore says, that
   life had not now at length began to be, though it had but lately
   appeared, for it was always with the Father.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [59] It is more consistent with the passage to take "from the
   beginning" here as from the beginning of the Gospel, from the beginning
   of the ministry of our Savior, because what had been from the beginning
   was what the apostles had heard and seen. That another view has been
   taken of these words has been owing to an over-anxiety on the part of
   many, especially of the Fathers, to establish the divinity of our
   Savior; but this is what is sufficiently evident from the second verse.
   See ch. 2:7, 24. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 John 1:3-7

   3. That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also
   may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the
   Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

   3. Quod vidimus et audivimus, annuntiamus vobis, ut et vos societatem
   habeatis nobiscum, et societas nostra sit cum Patre et cure filio ejus
   Jesu Christo.

   4. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

   4. Et hæc scribimus vobis, ut gaudium vestrum sit completum.

   5. This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare
   unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

   5. Et haec est promissio quam annuntiamus, quod Deus lux est, et
   tenebrae in eo non sunt ullae.

   6. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we
   lie, and do not the truth:

   6. Si dixerimus quod societatem habemus cum eo, et in tenebris
   ambulamus, mentimur, et veritatem non facimus.

   7. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
   fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
   cleanseth us from all sin.

   7. Si autem in luce ambulamus, sicut ipse in luce est, societatem
   habemus inter nos mutuam, et sanguis Jesu Christi filii ejus emundat
   nos ab omni peccato.


   3 That which we have seen. He now repeats the third time the words,
   seen and heard, that nothing might be wanting as to the real certainty
   of his doctrine. And it ought to be carefully noticed, that the heralds
   of the Gospel chosen by Christ were those who were fit and faithful
   witnesses of all those things which they were to declare. He also
   testifies of the feeling of their heart, for he says that he was moved
   by no other reason to write except to invite those to whom he was
   writing to the participation of an inestimable good. It hence appears
   how much care he had for their salvation; which served not a little to
   induce them to believe; for extremely ungrateful we must be, if we
   refuse to hear him who wishes to communicate to us a part of that
   happiness which he has obtained.

   He also sets forth the fruit received from the Gospel, even that we are
   united thereby to God, and to his Son Christ in whom is found the chief
   good. It was necessary for him to add this second clause, not only that
   he might represent the doctrine of the Gospel as precious and lovely,
   but that he might also show that he wished them to be his associates
   for no other end but to lead them to God, so that they might be all one
   in him. For the ungodly have also a mutual union between themselves,
   but it is without God, nay, in order to alienate themselves more and
   more from God, which is the extreme of all evils. It is, indeed, as it
   has been stated, our only true happiness, to be received into God's
   favor, so that we may be really united to him in Christ; of which John
   speaks in the seventeenth chapter of his gospel.

   In short, John declares, that as the apostles were adopted by Christ as
   brethren, that being gathered into one body, they might together be
   united to God, so he does the same with other colleagues; though many,
   they are yet made partakers of this holy and blessed union.

   4 That your joy may be full By full joy, he expresses more clearly the
   complete and perfect happiness which we obtain through the Gospel; at
   the same time he reminds the faithful where they ought to fix all their
   affections. True is that saying,

   "Where your treasure is, there will be your heart also."
   (Matthew 6:21.)

   Whosoever, then, really perceives what fellowship with God is, will be
   satisfied with it alone, and will no more burn with desires for other
   things.

   "The Lord is my cup," says David, "and my heritage; the lines have
   fallen for me on an excellent lot." (Psalm 16:5, 6.)

   In the same manner does Paul declare that all things were deemed by him
   as dung, in comparison with Christ alone. (Philippians 3:8.) He,
   therefore, has at length made a proficiency in the Gospel, who esteems
   himself happy in having communion with God, and acquiesces in that
   alone; and thus he prefers it to the whole world, so that he is ready
   for its sake to relinquish all other things.

   5 This then is the message, or promise. I do not disapprove of the
   rendering of the old interpreter, "This is the annunciation," or
   message; for though epangelia means for the most part a promise, yet,
   as John speaks here generally of the testimony before mentioned, the
   context seems to require the other meaning, except you were to give
   this explanation, "The promise which we bring to you, includes this, or
   has this condition annexed to it." Thus, the meaning of the Apostle
   would become evident to us. [60] For his object here was not to include
   the whole doctrine of the Gospel, but to shew that if we desire to
   enjoy Christ and his blessings, it is required of us to be conformed to
   God in righteousness and holiness. Paul says the same thing in the
   second chapter of the Epistle to Titus, "Appeared has the saving grace
   of God to all, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may live
   soberly and righteously and holily in this world;" except that here he
   says metaphorically, that we are to walk in the light, because God is
   light.

   But he calls God light, and says that he is in the light; such
   expressions are not to be too strictly taken. Why Satan is called the
   prince of darkness is sufficiently evident. When, therefore, God on the
   other hand is called the Father of light, and also light, we first
   understand that there is nothing in him but what is bright, pure, and
   unalloyed; and, secondly, that he makes all things so manifest by his
   brightness, that he suffers nothing vicious or perverted, no spots or
   filth, no hypocrisy or fraud, to lie hid. Then the sum of what is said
   is, that since there is no union between light and darkness, there is a
   separation between us and God as long as we walk in darkness; and that
   the fellowship which he mentions, cannot exist except we also become
   pure and holy.

   In him is no darkness at all. This mode of speaking is commonly used by
   John, to amplify what he has affirmed by a contrary negation. Then, the
   meaning is, that God is such a light, that no darkness belongs to him.
   It hence follows, that he hates an evil conscience, pollution, and
   wickedness, and everything that pertains to darkness.

   6 If we say It is, indeed, an argument from what is inconsistent, when
   he concludes that they are alienated from God, who walk in darkness.
   This doctrine, however, depends on a higher principle, that God
   sanctifies all who are his. For it is not a naked precept that he
   gives, which requires that our life should be holy; but he rather shews
   that the grace of Christ serves for this end to dissipate darkness, and
   to kindle in us the light of God; as though he had said, "What God
   communicates to us is not a vain fiction; for it is necessary that the
   power and effect of this fellowship should shine forth in our life;
   otherwise the possession of the gospel is fallacious." What he adds,
   and do not the truth, is the same as if he had said, "We do not act
   truthfully. We do not regard what is true and right." And this mode of
   speaking, as I have before observed, is frequently used by him.

   7 But if we walk in the light. He now says, that the proof of our union
   with God is certain, if we are conformable to him; not that purity of
   life conciliates us to God, as the prior cause; but the Apostle means,
   that our union with God is made evident by the effect, that is, when
   his purity shines forth in us. And, doubtless, such is the fact;
   wherever God comes, all things are so imbued with his holiness, that he
   washes away all filth; for without him we have nothing but filth and
   darkness. It is hence evident, that no one leads a holy life, except he
   is united to God.

   In saying, We have fellowship one with another, he does not speak
   simply of men; but he sets God on one side, and us on the other.

   It may, however, be asked, "Who among men can so exhibit the light of
   God in his life, as that this likeness which John requires should
   exist; for it would be thus necessary, that he should be wholly pure
   and free from darkness." To this I answer, that expressions of this
   kind are accommodated to the capacities of men; he is therefore said to
   be like God, who aspires to his likeness, however distant from it he
   may as yet be. The example ought not to be otherwise applied than
   according to this passage. He walks in darkness who is not ruled by the
   fear of God, and who does not, with a pure conscience, devote himself
   wholly to God, and seek to promote his glory. Then, on the other hand,
   he who in sincerity of heart spends his life, yea, every part of it, in
   the fear and service of God, and faithfully worships him, walks in the
   light, for he keeps the right way, though he may in many things offend
   and sigh under the burden of the flesh. Then, integrity of conscience
   is alone that which distinguishes light from darkness.

   And the blood of Jesus Christ After having taught what is the bond of
   our union with God, he now shews what fruit flows from it, even that
   our sins are freely remitted. And this is the blessedness which David
   describes in the thirty-second Psalm, in order that we may know that we
   are most miserable until, being renewed by God's Spirit, we serve him
   with a sincere heart. For who can be imagined more miserable than that
   man whom God hates and abominates, and over whose head is suspended
   both the wrath of God and eternal death?

   This passage is remarkable; and from it we first learn, that the
   expiation of Christ, effected by his death, does then properly belong
   to us, when we, in uprightness of heart, do what is right and just for
   Christ is no redeemer except to those who turn from iniquity, and lead
   a new life. If, then, we desire to have God propitious to us, so as to
   forgive our sins, we ought not to forgive ourselves. In short,
   remission of sins cannot be separated from repentance, nor can the
   peace of God be in those hearts, where the fear God does not prevail.

   Secondly, this passage shews that the gratuitous pardon of sins is
   given us not only once, but that it is a benefit perpetually residing
   in the Church, and daily offered to the faithful. For the Apostle here
   addresses the faithful; as doubtless no man has ever been, nor ever
   will be, who can otherwise please God, since all are guilty before him;
   for however strong a desire there may be in us of acting rightly, we
   always go haltingly to God. Yet what is half done obtains no approval
   with God. In the meantime, by new sins we continually separate
   ourselves, as far as we can, from the grace of God. Thus it is, that
   all the saints have need of the daily forgiveness of sins; for this
   alone keeps us in the family of God.

   By saying, from all sin, he intimates that we are, on many accounts,
   guilty before God; so that doubtless there is no one who has not many
   vices. But he shews that no sins prevent the godly, and those who fear
   God, from obtaining his favor. He also points out the manner of
   obtaining pardon, and the cause of our cleansing, even because Christ
   expiated our sins by his blood; but he affirms that all the godly are
   undoubtedly partakers of this cleansing.

   The whole of his doctrine has been wickedly perverted by the sophists;
   for they imagine that pardon of sins is given us, as it were, in
   baptism. They maintain that there only the blood of Christ avails; and
   they teach, that after baptism, God is not otherwise reconciled than by
   satisfactions. They, indeed, leave some part to the blood of Christ;
   but when they assign merit to works, even in the least degree, they
   wholly subvert what John teaches here, as to the way of expiating sins,
   and of being reconciled to God. For these two things can never
   harmonize together, to be cleansed by the blood of Christ, and to be
   cleansed by works: for John assigns not the half, but the whole, to the
   blood of Christ.

   The sum of what is said, then, is, that the faithful know of a
   certainty, that they are accepted by God, because he has been
   reconciled to them through the sacrifice of the death of Christ. And
   sacrifice includes cleansing and satisfaction. Hence the power and
   efficiency of these belong to the blood of Christ alone.

   Hereby is disproved and exposed the sacrilegious invention of the
   Papists as to indulgences; for as though the blood of Christ were not
   sufficient, they add, as a subsidy to it, the blood and merits of
   martyrs. At the same time, this blasphemy advances much further among
   us; for as they say that their keys, by which they hold as shut up the
   remission of sins, open a treasure made up partly of the blood and
   merits of martyrs, and partly of the worlds of supererogation, by which
   any sinner may redeem himself, no remission of sins remains for them
   but what is derogatory to the blood of Christ; for if their doctrine
   stands, the blood of Christ does not cleanse us, but comes in, as it
   were, as a partial aid. Thus consciences are held in suspense, which
   the Apostle here bids to rely on the blood of Christ.

   1 John 1:8-10

   8. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
   is not in us.

   8. Si dixerimus quod peccatum non habemus, nos ipsos decipimus, et
   veritas non est in nobis.

   9. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

   9. Si confitemur peccata nostra, fidelis est et justus, ut nobis
   peccata remittat; et purget nos ab omni injustitia.

   10. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word
   is not in us.

   10. Si dixerimus quod non peccavimus, mendacem facimus eum, et sermo
   ejus non est in nobis.


   8. If we say. He now commends grace from its necessity; for as no one
   is free from sin, he intimates that we are all lost and undone, except
   the Lord comes to our aid with the remedy of pardon. The reason why he
   so much dwells on the fact, that no one is innocent, is, that all may
   now fully know that they stand in need of mercy, to deliver them from
   punishment, and that they may thus be more roused to seek the necessary
   blessing.

   By the word sin, is meant here not only corrupt and vicious
   inclination, but the fault or sinful act which really renders us guilty
   before God. Besides, as it is a universal declaration, it follows, that
   none of the saints, who exist now, have been, or shall be, are exempted
   from the number. Hence most fitly did Augustine refute the cavil of the
   Pelagians, by adducing against them this passage: and he wisely thought
   that the confession of guilt is not required for humility's sake, but
   lest we by lying should deceive ourselves.

   When he adds, and the truth is not in us, he confirms, according to his
   usual manner, the former sentence by repeating it in other words;
   though it is not a simple repetition, (as elsewhere,) but he says that
   they are deceived who glory in falsehood.

   9 If we confess He again promises to the faithful that God will be
   propitious to them, provided they acknowledge themselves to be sinners.
   It is of great moment to be fully persuaded, that when we have sinned,
   there is a reconciliation with God ready and prepared for us: we shall
   otherwise carry always a hell within us. Few, indeed, consider how
   miserable and wretched is a doubting conscience; but the truth is, that
   hell reigns where there is no peace with God. The more, then, it
   becomes us to receive with the whole heart this promise which offers
   free pardon to all who confess their sins. Moreover, this is founded
   even on the justice of God, because God who promises is true and just.
   For they who think that he is called just, because he justifies us
   freely, reason, as I think, with too much refinement, because justice
   or righteousness here depends on fidelity, and both are annexed to the
   promise. For God might have been just, were he to deal with us with all
   the rigor of justice; but as he has bound himself to us by his word, he
   would not have himself deemed just, except he forgives. [61]

   But this confession, as it is made to God, must be in sincerity; and
   the heart cannot speak to God without newness of life. It then includes
   true repentance. God, indeed, forgives freely, but in such a way, that
   the facility of mercy does not become an enticement to sin.

   And to cleanse us The verb, to cleanse, seems to be taken in another
   sense than before; for he had said, that we are cleansed by the blood
   of Christ, because through him sins are not imputed; but now, having
   spoken of pardon, he also adds, that God cleanses us from iniquity: so
   that this second clause is different from the preceding. Thus he
   initiates that a twofold fruit comes to us from confession, -- that God
   being reconciled by the sacrifice of Christ, forgives us, -- and that
   he renews and reforms us.

   Were any one to object and say, that as long as we sojourn in the
   world, we are never cleansed from all unrighteousness, with regard to
   our reformation: this is indeed true; but John does not refer to what
   God now performs in us. He is faithful, he says, to cleanse us, not
   today or tomorrow; for as long as we are surrounded with flesh, we
   ought to be in a continual state of progress; but what he has once
   begun, he goes on daily to do, until he at length completes it. So Paul
   says, that we are chosen, that we may appear without blame before God,
   (Colossians 1:22;) and in another place he says, that the Church is
   cleansed, that it might be without spot or wrinkle. (Ephesians 5:27.)

   If yet any one prefers another explanation, that he says the same thing
   twice over, I shall not object. [62]

   10 We make him a liar He goes still further, that they who claim purity
   for themselves blaspheme God. For we see that he everywhere represents
   the whole race of man as guilty of sin.

   Whosoever then tries to escape this charge carries on war with God, and
   accuses him of falsehood, as though he condemned the undeserving. To
   confirm this he adds, and his word is not in us; as though he had said,
   that we reject this great truth, that all are under guilt.

   We hence learn, that we then only make a due progress in the knowledge
   of the word of the Lord, when we become really humbled, so as to groan
   under the burden of our sins and learn to flee to the mercy of God, and
   acquiesce in nothing else but in his paternal favor.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [61] "Faithful" and "just" are nearly of the same import, having both a
   regard to God's promise, only the latter affords a stronger or an
   additional ground of confidence, inasmuch as the fulfillment of God's
   gracious promise is set forth as an act of justice. So that the
   penitent has here two of God's attributes, faithfulness and justice, to
   encourage and support his faith. We may, at the same time, consider
   "just" as having reference to forgiveness, and "faithful" to cleansing,
   according to a very common mode of stating things both in the Old and
   New Testament, the order in the second clause being reversed. Then
   "just" means the same as when Paul says, "that he might be just and the
   justifier of him that believeth in Jesus," Romans 3:26. Forgiveness is
   thus an act of justice, then, not to us, but to Christ, who made an
   atonement for sins. -- Ed.

   [62] That is, that he refers to forgiveness in the two clauses. -- Ed

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 John 2:1-2

   1. My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
   And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
   the righteous:

   1. Filioli mei, haec scribo vobis, ut non peccetis; quod si quis
   peccaverit, advocatum habemus apud Patrem, Jesum Christum justum:

   2. And he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but
   also for the sins of the whole world.

   2. Et ipse est propitiatio pro peccatis nostris, non pro nostris autem
   solum, sed etiam pro totius mundi.


   1. My little children. It is not only the sum and substance of the
   preceding doctrine, but the meaning of almost the whole gospel, that we
   are to depart from sin; and yet, though we are always exposed to God's
   judgment, we are certain that Christ so intercedes by the sacrifice of
   his death, that the Father is propitious to us. In the meantime, he
   also anticipates an objection, lest any one should think that he gave
   license to sin when he spoke of God's mercy, and shewed that it is
   presented to us all. He then joins together two parts of the gospel,
   which unreasonable men separate, and thus lacerate and mutilate.
   Besides, the doctrine of grace has always been calumniated by the
   ungodly. When the expiation of sins by Christ is set forth, they
   boastingly say that a license is given to sin.

   To obviate these calumnies, the Apostle testifies first that the design
   of his doctrine was to keep men from sinning; for when he says, that ye
   sin not, his meaning only is, that they, according to the measure of
   human infirmity, should abstain from sins. And to the same purpose is
   what I have already said respecting fellowship with God, that we are to
   be conformable to him. He is not, however, silent as to the gratuitous
   remission of sins; for though heaven should fall and all things be
   confounded, yet this part of truth ought never to be omitted; but, on
   the contrary, what Christ is ought to be preached clearly and
   distinctly.

   So ought we also to do at this day. As the flesh is inclined to
   wantonness, men ought to be carefully warned, that righteousness and
   salvation are provided in Christ for this end, that we may become the
   holy possession of God. Yet whenever it happens that men wantonly abuse
   the mercy of God, there are many snarlish men who load us with calumny,
   as though we gave loose reins to vices. We ought still boldly to go on
   and proclaim the grace of Christ, in which especially shines forth the
   glory of God, and in which consists the whole salvation of men. These
   barkings of the ungodly ought, I repeat it, to be wholly disregarded;
   for we see that the apostles were also by these barkings assailed.

   For this reason he immediately adds the second clause, that when we sin
   we have an advocate By these words he confirms what we have already
   said, that we are very far from being perfectly righteous, nay, that we
   contract new guilt daily, and that yet there is a remedy for
   reconciling us to God, if we flee to Christ; and this is alone that in
   which consciences call acquiesce, in which is included the
   righteousness of men, in which is founded the hope of salvation.

   The conditional particle, if, ought to be viewed as causal; for it
   cannot be but that we sin. In short, John means, that we are not only
   called away from sin by the gospel, because God invites us to himself,
   and offers to us the Spirit of regeneration, but that a provision is
   made for miserable sinners, that they may have God always propitious to
   them, and that the sins by which they are entangled, do not prevent
   them from becoming just, because they have a Mediator to reconcile them
   to God. But in order to shew how we return into favor with God, he says
   that Christ is our advocate; for he appears before God for this end,
   that he may exercise towards us the power and efficacy of his
   sacrifice. That this may be better understood, I will speak more
   homely. The intercession of Christ is a continual application of his
   death for our salvation. That God then does not impute to us our sins,
   this comes to us, because he has regard to Christ as intercessor.

   But the two names, by which he afterwards signalizes Christ, properly
   belong to the subject of this passage. He calls him just and a
   propitiation. It is necessary for him to be both, that he might sustain
   the office and person of an Advocate; for who that is a sinner could
   reconcile God to us? For we are excluded from access to him, because no
   one is pure and free from sin. Hence no one is fit to be a high priest,
   except he is innocent and separated from sinners, as it is also
   declared in Hebrews 7:26. Propitiation is added, because no one is fit
   to be a high priest without a sacrifice. Hence, under the Law, no
   priest entered the sanctuary without blood; and a sacrifice, as a usual
   seal, was wont, according to God's appointment, to accompany prayers.
   By this symbol it was God's design to shew, that whosoever obtains
   favor for us, must be furnished with a sacrifice; for when God is
   offended, in order to pacify him a satisfaction is required. It hence
   follows, that all the saints who have ever been and shall be, have need
   of an advocate, and that no one except Christ is equal to undertake
   this office. And doubtless John ascribed these two things to Christ, to
   shew that he is the only true advocate.

   Now, as no small consolation comes to us, when we hear that Christ not
   only died for us to reconcile us to the Father, but that he continually
   intercedes for us, so that an access in his name is open to us, that
   our prayers may be heard; so we ought especially to beware, lest this
   honor, which belongs peculiarly to him, should be transferred to
   another.

   But we know that under the Papacy this office is ascribed
   indiscriminately to the saints. Thirty years ago, this so remarkable an
   article of our faith, that Christ is our advocate, was nearly buried;
   but at this day they allow that he is indeed one of many, but not the
   only one. They among the Papists who have a little more modesty, do not
   deny that Christ excels others; but they afterwards join with him a
   vast number of associates. But the words clearly mean that he cannot be
   an advocate who is not a priest; and the priesthood belongs to none but
   to Christ alone. In the meantime we do not take away the mutual
   intercessions of saints, which they exercise in love towards one
   another; but this has nothing to do with the dead who have removed from
   their intercourse with men; and nothing with that patronage which they
   feign for themselves, that they may not be dependent on Christ alone.
   For though brethren pray for brethren, yet they all, without exception,
   look to one advocate. There is, then, no doubt but the Papists set up
   against Christ so many idols as the patrons or advocates they devise
   for themselves.

   We must also notice by the way, that those err very grossly, who
   imagine that Christ falls on his knees before the Father to pray for
   us. Such thoughts ought to be renounced, for they detract from the
   celestial glory of Christ; and the simple truth ought to be retained,
   that the fruit of his death is ever new and perpetual, that by his
   intercession he renders God propitious to us, and that he sanctifies
   our prayers by the odor of his sacrifice, and also aids us by pleading
   for us.

   2 And not for ours only He added this for the sake of amplifying, in
   order that the faithful might be assured that the expiation made by
   Christ, extends to all who by faith embrace the gospel.

   Here a question may be raised, how have the sins of the whole world
   been expiated? I pass by the dotages of the fanatics, who under this
   pretense extend salvation to all the reprobate, and therefore to Satan
   himself. Such a monstrous thing deserves no refutation. They who seek
   to avoid this absurdity, have said that Christ [63] suffered
   sufficiently for the whole world, but efficiently only for the elect.
   This solution has commonly prevailed in the schools. Though then I
   allow that what has been said is true, yet I deny that it is suitable
   to this passage; for the design of John was no other than to make this
   benefit common to the whole Church. Then under the word all or whole,
   he does not include the reprobate, but designates those who should
   believe as well as those who were then scattered through various parts
   of the world. For then is really made evident, as it is meet, the grace
   of Christ, when it is declared to be the only true salvation of the
   world.

   1 John 2: 3-6

   3. And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.

   3. Atque in hoc cognoscimus quod cognovimus eum, si praecepta ejus
   servamus.

   4. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
   liar, and the truth is not in him.

   4. Qui dicit, Novi eum, et praecepta ejus non servat, mendax est, et in
   eo veritas non est.

   5. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
   perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.

   5. Qui vero servat ejus sermonem, vere in ipso charitas Dei perfecta
   est; in hoc cognoscimus quod in ipso sumus.

   6. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even
   as he walked.

   6. Qui dicit se in eo manere, debet, sicut ille ambulavit, ita et ipse
   ambulare.


   3 And hereby, or by this. After having treated of the doctrine
   respecting the gratuitous remission of sins, he comes to the
   exhortations which belong to it, and which depend on it. And first
   indeed he reminds us that the knowledge of God, derived from the
   gospel, is not ineffectual, but that obedience proceeds from it. He
   then shews what God especially requires from us, what is the chief
   thing in life, even love to God. What we read here of the living
   knowledge of God, the Scripture does not without reason repeat
   everywhere; for nothing is more common in the world than to draw the
   doctrine of religion to frigid speculations. In this way theology has
   been adulterated by the Sorbonian sophists, so that from their whole
   science not even the least spark of true religion shines forth. And
   curious men do everywhere learn so much from God's word, as enables
   them to prattle for the sake of display. In short, no evil has been
   more common in all ages than vainly to profess God's name.

   John then takes this principle as granted, that the knowledge of God is
   efficacious. He hence concludes, that they by no means know God who
   keep not his precepts or commandments. Plato, though groping in
   darkness, yet denied that "the beautiful" which he imagined, could be
   known, without filling man with the admiration of itself; so he says in
   his Phaedrus and in other places. How then is it possible for thee to
   know God, and to be moved by no feeling? Nor does it indeed proceed
   only from God's nature, that to know him is immediately to love him;
   but the Spirit also, who illuminates our minds, inspires our hearts
   with a feeling conformable to our knowledge. At the same time the
   knowledge of God leads us to fear him and to love him. For we cannot
   know him as Lord and Father, as he shews himself, without being dutiful
   children and obedient servants. In short, the doctrine of the gospel is
   a lively mirror in which we contemplate the image of God, and are
   transformed into the same, as Paul teaches us in 2 Corinthians 3:18.
   Where, therefore, there is no pure conscience, nothing can be there but
   an empty phantom of knowledge.

   We must notice the order when he says, We do know that we know him; for
   he intimates that obedience is so connected with knowledge, that the
   last is yet in order the first, as the cause is necessarily before its
   effect.

   If we keep his commandments But there is no one who in everything keeps
   them; there would thus be no knowledge of God in the world. To this I
   answer, that the Apostle is by no means inconsistent with himself;
   since he has before shewed that all are guilty before God, he does not
   understand that those who keep his commandments wholly satisfy the law
   (no such example can be found in the world;) but that they are such as
   strive, according to the capacity of human infirmity, to form their
   life in conformity to the will of God. For whenever Scripture speaks of
   the righteousness of the faithful, it does not exclude the remission of
   sins, but on the contrary, begins with it.

   But we are not hence to conclude that faith recumbs on works; for
   though every one receives a testimony to his faith from his works, yet
   it does not follow that it is founded on them, since they are added as
   an evidence. Then the certainty of faith depends on the grace of Christ
   alone; but piety and holiness of life distinguish true faith from that
   knowledge of God which is fictitious and dead; for the truth is, that
   those who are in Christ, as Paul says, have put off the old man.
   (Colossians 3:9.)

   4 He that saith, I know him How does he prove that they are liars who
   boast that they have faith without piety? even by the contrary effect;
   for he has already said, that the knowledge of God is efficacious. For
   God is not known by a naked imagination, since he reveals himself
   inwardly to our hearts by the Spirit. Besides, as many hypocrites
   vainly boast that they have faith, the Apostle charges all such with
   falsehood; for what he says would be superfluous, were there no false
   and vain profession of Christianity made by man.

   5 But whoso keepeth He now defines what a true keeping of God's law is,
   even to love God. This passage is, I think, incorrectly explained by
   those who understand that they please the true God who keep his word.
   Rather take this as its meaning, "to love God in sincerity of heart, is
   to keep his commandments." For he intended, as I have before reminded
   you, briefly to shew what God requires from us, and what is the
   holiness of the faithful. Moses also said the same thing, when he
   stated the sum of the law.

   "Now, O Israel, what does the Lord require of thee, but to fear and
   love him, and to walk in his precepts?"
   (Deuteronomy 10:12.)

   And again he says,

   "Choose life, even to love the Lord thy God, to serve him and to cleave
   to him." (Deuteronomy 30:19, 20)

   For the law, which is spiritual, does not command only external works,
   but enjoins this especially, to love God with the whole heart.

   That no mention is here made of what is due to men, ought not to be
   viewed as unreasonable; for brotherly love flows immediately from the
   love of God, as we shall hereafter see. Whosoever, then, desires that
   his life should be approved by God, must have all his doings directed
   to this end. If any one objects and says, that no one has ever been
   found who loved God thus perfectly; to this I reply, that it is
   sufficient, provided every one aspired to this perfection according to
   the measure of grace given unto him. In the meantime, the definition
   is, that the perfect love of God is the complete keeping of his law. To
   make progress in this as in knowledge, is what we ought to do.

   Hereby know we that we are in him He refers to that fruit of the gospel
   which he had mentioned, even fellowship with the Father and the Son;
   and he thus confirms the former sentence, by stating what follows, as a
   consequence. For if it be the end of the gospel to hold communion with
   God, and no communion can be without love, then no one makes a real
   progress in faith except he who cleaves from the heart to God.

   6 He that saith he abideth in him As he has before set before us God as
   light for an example, he now calls us also to Christ, that we may
   imitate him. Yet he does not simply exhort us to imitate Christ; but
   from the union we have with him, he proves that we ought to be like
   him. A likeness in life and deeds, he says, will prove that we abide in
   Christ. But from these words he passes on to the next clause, which he
   immediately adds respecting love to the brethren.

   1 John 2: 7-11

   7. Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
   commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the
   word which ye have heard from the beginning.

   7. Fratres, non mandatum novum mandment scribo vobis, sed mandatum
   vetus, quod habuistis ab initio: mandatum vetus est sermo quem audistis
   ab initio.

   8. Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in
   him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now
   shineth.

   8. Rursum mandatum novum scribo vobis, quae est veritas in ipso et in
   vobis; quia tenebrae transeunt, et lumen verum jam lucet.

   9. He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in
   darkness even until now.

   9. Quia dicit se in luce esse, et fratrem suum odit, in tenebræ est
   adhuc.

   10. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none
   occasion of stumbling in him.

   10. Qui diligit fratrem suum, in luce manet, et offendiculum in eo non
   est.

   11. But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
   darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath
   blinded his eyes.

   11. Qui vero fratrem suum odit, in tenebris ambulat, nec scit quo
   vadat, quia tenebrae excaecarunt oculos ejus.


   7 Brethren, I write no new commandment This is an explanation of the
   preceding doctrine, that to love God is to keep his commandments. And
   not without reason did he largely dwell on this point. First, we know
   that novelty is disliked or suspected. Secondly, we do not easily
   undertake an unwonted yoke. In addition to these things, when we have
   embraced any kind of doctrine, we dislike to have anything changed or
   made new in it. For these reasons John reminds us, that he taught
   nothing respecting love but what had been heard by the faithful from
   the beginning, and had by long usage become old.

   Some explain oldness differently, even that Christ now prescribes no
   other rule of life under the Gospel than what God did formerly under
   the Law. This is indeed most true; nor do I object but that he
   afterwards calls in this sense the word of the gospel the old
   commandment But I think that he now means only, that these were the
   first elements of the gospel, that they had been thus taught from the
   beginning, that there was no reason why they should refuse that as
   unusual by which they ought to have been long ago imbued. For the
   relative seems to be used in a causative sense. He calls it then old,
   not because it was taught the fathers many ages before, but because it
   had been taught them on their new entrance into a religious life. And
   it served much to claim their faith, that it had proceeded from Christ
   himself from whom they had received the gospel. [64]

   The old commandment The word old, in this place, probably extends
   further; for the sentence is fuller, when he says, the word which ye
   have heard from the beginning is the old commandment And as I, indeed,
   think, he means that the gospel ought not to be received as a doctrine
   lately born, but what has proceeded from God, and is his eternal truth;
   as though he had said, "Ye ought not to measure the antiquity of the
   gospel which is brought to you, by time; since therein is revealed to
   you the eternal will of God: not only then has God delivered to you
   this rule of a holy life, when ye were first called to the faith of
   Christ, but the same has always been prescribed and approved by him."
   And, doubtless, this only ought to be deemed antiquity, and deserves
   faith and reverence, which has its origin from God. For the fictions of
   men, whatever long prescription of years they may have, cannot acquire
   so much authority as to subvert the truth of God.

   8 Again, a new commandment Interpreters do not appear to me to have
   attained the meaning of the Apostle. He says new, because God, as it
   were, renews it by daily suggesting it, so that the faithful may
   practice it through their whole life, for nothing more excellent can be
   sought for by them. The elements which children learn give place in
   time to what is higher and more solid. On the contrary, John denies
   that the doctrine respecting brotherly love is of this kind, is one
   which grows old with time, but that it is perpetually in force, so that
   it is no less the highest perfection than the very beginning.

   It was, however, necessary that this should be added, for as men are
   more curious than what they ought to be, there are many who always seek
   something new. Hence there is a weariness as to simple doctrine, which
   produces innumerable prodigies of errors, when every one gapes
   continually for new mysteries. Now, when it is known that the Lord
   proceeds in the same even course, in order to keep us through life in
   that which we have learnt, a bridle is cast on desires of this kind.
   Let him, then, who would reach the goal of wisdom, as to the right way
   of living, make proficiency in love.

   Which then is true, or which is truth. He proves by this reason what he
   had said; for this one command respecting love, as to our conduct in
   life, constitutes the whole truth of Christ. Besides, what other
   greater revelation can be expected? for Christ, doubtless, is the end
   and the completion of all things. Hence the word truth means this, that
   they stood, as it were at the goal, for it is to be taken for a
   completion or a perfect state. He joins Christ to them, as the head to
   the members, as though he had said, that the body of the Church has no
   other perfection, or, that they would then be really united to Christ,
   if holy love existed continually among them.

   Some give another explanation, "That which is the truth in Christ, is
   also in you." But I do not see what the meaning of this is.

   Because the darkness is past. The present time is here instead of the
   past; for he means, that as soon as Christ brings light, we have the
   full brightness of knowledge: not that every one of the faithful
   becomes wise the first day as much as he ought to be, (for even Paul
   testifies that he labored to apprehend what he had not apprehended,
   (Philippians 3:12,) but that the knowledge of Christ alone is
   sufficient to dissipate darkness. Hence, daily progress is necessary;
   and the faith of every one has its dawn before it reaches the noonday.
   But as God continues the inculcation of the same doctrine, in which he
   bids us to make advances, the knowledge of the Gospel is justly said to
   be the true light, when Christ, the Sun of righteousness, shines. Thus
   the way is shut up against the audacity of those men who try to corrupt
   the purity of the Gospel by their own fictions; and we may safely
   denounce an anathema on the whole theology of the Pope, for it wholly
   obscures the true light.

   9 He that saith he is in the light He pursues the same metaphor. He
   said that love is the only true rule according to which our life is to
   be formed; he said that this rule or law is presented to us in the
   Gospel; he said, lastly, that it is there as the meridian light, which
   ought to be continually looked on. Now, on the other hand, he concludes
   that all are blind and walk in darkness who are strangers to love. But
   that he mentioned before the love of God and now the love of the
   brethren, involves no more contrariety than there is between the effect
   and its cause. Besides, these are so connected together that they
   cannot be separated.

   John says in the third chapter, that we falsely boast of love to God,
   except we love our brethren; and this is most true. But he now takes
   love to the brethren as a testimony by which we prove that we love God.
   In short, since love so regards God, that in God it embraces men, there
   is nothing strange in this, that the Apostle, speaking of love, should
   refer at one time to God, at another to the brethren; and this is what
   is commonly done in Scripture. The whole perfection of life is often
   said to consist in the love of God; and again, Paul teaches us, that
   the whole law is fulfilled by him who loves his neighbor, (Romans
   13:8;) and Christ declares that the main points of the law are
   righteousness, judgment, and truth. (Matthew 23:23.) Both these things
   are true and agree well together, for the love of God teaches us to
   love men, and we also in reality prove our love to God by loving men at
   his command. However this may be, it remains always certain that love
   is the rule of life. And this ought to be the more carefully noticed,
   because all choose rather almost anything else than this one
   commandment of God.

   To the same purpose is what follows, and there is no occasion of
   stumbling in him -- that is, in him who acts in love; for, he who thus
   lives will never stumble. [65]

   11. But he that hateth his brother. He again reminds us, that whatever
   specious appearance of excellency thou shewest, there is yet nothing
   but what is sinful if love be absent. This passage may be compared with
   the thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians, and no
   long explanation is needed. But this doctrine is not understood by the
   world, because the greater part are dazzled by all sorts of masks or
   disguises. Thus, fictitious sanctity dazzles the eyes of almost all
   men, while love is neglected, or, at least, driven to the farthest
   corner.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [64] That this view is correct, appears evident from the words, "which
   ye had from the beginning;" he calls it "old," because they had been
   taught it from "the beginning," that is, of the gospel. Then "new" can
   mean no other thing than what Calvin states, that it continues still in
   force, it being, as it were, always new. -- Ed.

   [65] Literally, "and to him there is not a stumblingblock;" that is,
   nothing that causes him to stumble or fall. He is not like him
   mentioned in the next verse, who "walks in darkness and knows not
   whither he goeth." The sentence seems to have been taken from Psalm
   119:165, with this only difference, that it is "to them," instead of
   "to him." There is in the Sept no preposition, but in Hebrew the
   preposition "to" is used; and en has sometimes this meaning in the New
   Testament. See Colossians 1:23; 1 Thessalonians 4:7. -- Ed.

   1 John 2:12-14

   12. I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven
   you for his name's sake.

   12. Scribo vobis, filioli, quoniam remittuntur vobis peccata vestra
   propter homer ejus.

   13. I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from
   the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome
   the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have
   known the Father.

   13. Scribo vobis, patres, quoniam novistis eum qui est ab initio.
   Scribo vobis, adolescentes, quoniam vicistis malum illum. Scribo vobis,
   pueri, quoniam novistis Patrem.

   14. I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is
   from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are
   strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the
   wicked one.

   14. Scripsi vobis, patres, quoniam novistis eum qui est ab initio.
   Scripsi vobis, adolescentes, quia fortes estis, et verbum Dei manet in
   vobis, et vicistis malum illum.


   12 Little children This is still a general declaration, for he does not
   address those only of a tender age, but by little children he means men
   of all ages, as in the first verse, and also hereafter. I say this,
   because interpreters have incorrectly applied the term to children. But
   John, when he speaks of children, calls them paidia, a word expressive
   of age; but here, as a spiritual father, he calls the old as well as
   the young, teknia He will, indeed, presently address special words to
   different ages; yet they are mistaken who think that he begins to do so
   here. But, on the contrary, lest the preceding exhortation should
   obscure the free remission of sins, he again inculcates the doctrine
   which peculiarly belongs to faith, in order that the foundation may
   with certainty be always retained, that salvation is laid up for us in
   Christ alone.

   Holiness of life ought indeed to be urged, the fear of God ought to be
   carefully enjoined, men ought to be sharply goaded to repentance,
   newness of life, together with its fruits, ought to be commended; but
   still we ought ever to take heed, lest the doctrine of faith be
   smothered, -- that doctrine which teaches that Christ is the only
   author of salvation and of all blessings; on the contrary, such
   moderation ought to be presented, that faith may ever retain its own
   primacy. This is the rule prescribed to us by John: having faithfully
   spoken of good works, lest he should seem to give them more importance
   than he ought to have done, he carefully calls us back to contemplate
   the grace of Christ.

   Your sins are forgiven you Without this assurance, religion would not
   be otherwise than fading and shadowy; nay, they who pass by the free
   remission of sins, and dwell on other things, build without a
   foundation. John in the meantime intimates, that nothing is more
   suitable to stimulate men to fear God than when they are rightly taught
   what blessing Christ has brought to them, as Paul does, when he
   beseeches by the bowels of God's mercies. (Philippians 2:1.)

   It hence appears how wicked is the calumny of the Papists, who pretend
   that the desire of doing what is right is frozen, when that is extolled
   which alone renders us obedient children to God. For the Apostle takes
   this as the ground of his exhortation, that we know that God is so
   benevolent to us as not to impute to us our sins.

   For his name's sake The material cause is mentioned, lest we should
   seek other means to reconcile us to God. For it would not be sufficient
   to know that God forgives us our sins, except we came directly to
   Christ, and to that price which he paid on the cross for us. And this
   ought the more to be observed, because we see that by the craft of
   Satan, and by the wicked fictions of men, this way is obstructed; for
   foolish men attempt to pacify God by various satisfactions, and devise
   innumerable kinds of expiations for the purpose of redeeming
   themselves. For as many means of deserving pardon we intrude on God, by
   so many obstacles are we prevented from approaching him. Hence John,
   not satisfied with stating simply the doctrine, that God remits to us
   our sins, expressly adds, that he is propitious to us from a regard to
   Christ, in order that he might exclude all other reasons. We also, that
   we may enjoy this blessing, must pass by and forget all other names,
   and rely only on the name of Christ.

   13 I write unto you, fathers He comes now to enumerate different ages,
   that he might shew that what he taught was suitable to every one of
   them. For a general address sometimes produces less effect; yea, such
   is our perversity, that few think that what is addressed to all belongs
   to them. The old for the most part excuse themselves, because they have
   exceeded the age of learning; children refuse to learn, as they are not
   yet old enough; men of middle age do not attend, because they are
   occupied with other pursuits. Lest, then, any should exempt themselves,
   he accommodates the Gospel to all. And he mentions three ages, the most
   common division of human life. Hence also, the Lacedemonian chorus had
   three orders; the first sang, "What ye are we shall be;" the last,
   "What ye are we have been;" and the middle, "We are what one of you
   have been and the other will be." Into these three degrees John divides
   human life.

   He, indeed, begins with the old, and says that the Gospel is suitable
   to them, because they learnt from it to know the eternal Son of God.
   Moroseness is the character of the old, but they become especially
   unteachable, because they measure wisdom by the number of years.
   Besides, Horace in his Art of Poetry, has justly noticed this fault in
   them, that they praise the time of their youth and reject whatever is
   differently done or said. This evil John wisely removes, when he
   reminds us that the Gospel contains not only a knowledge that is
   ancient, but what also leads us to the very eternity of God. It hence
   follows that there is nothing here which they can dislike. He says that
   Christ was from the beginning; I refer this to his Divine presence, as
   being co-eternal with the Father, as well as to his power, of which the
   Apostle speaks in Hebrews, that he was yesterday what he is today; as
   though he had said,

   "If antiquity delights you, ye have Christ, who is superior to all
   antiquity; therefore his disciples ought not to be ashamed of him who
   includes all ages in Himself." (Hebrews 13:8)

   We must, at the same time, notice what that religion is which is really
   ancient, even that which is founded on Christ, for otherwise it will be
   of no avail, however long it may have existed, if it derives its origin
   from error.

   I write unto you, young men Though it be a diminutive word, neaniskoi,
   [66] yet there is no doubt but that he directs his word to all who were
   in the flower of their age. We also know that those of that age are so
   addicted to the vain cares of the world, that they think but little of
   the kingdom of God; for the rigor of their minds and the strength of
   their bodies in a manner inebriate them. Hence the Apostle reminds them
   where true strength is, that they might no more exult as usual in the
   flesh. Ye are strong, he says, because ye have overcome Satan. The
   copulative here is to be rendered causatively. And, doubtless, that
   strength is what we ought to seek, even that which is spiritual. At the
   same time he intimates that it is not had otherwise than from Christ,
   for he mentions the blessings which we receive through the Gospel. He
   says that they had conquered who were as yet engaged in the contest;
   but our condition is far otherwise than that of those who fight under
   the banners of men, for war is doubtful to them and the issue is
   uncertain; but we are conquerors before we engage with the enemy, for
   our head Christ has once for all conquered for us the whole world.

   I write unto you, young children They needed another direction. That
   the Gospel is well adapted to young children the Apostle concludes,
   because they find there the Father. We now see how diabolical is the
   tyranny of the Pope, which drives away by threats all ages from the
   doctrine of the Gospel, while the Spirit of God so carefully addresses
   them all.

   But these things which the Apostle makes particular, are also general;
   for we should wholly fall off into vanity, except our infirmity were
   sustained by the eternal truth of God. There is nothing in us but what
   is frail and fading, except the power of Christ dwells in us. We are
   all like orphans until we attain the grace of adoption by the Gospel.
   Hence, what he declares respecting young children is also true as to
   the old. But yet his object was to apply to each what was most
   especially necessary for them, that he might shew that they all without
   exception stood in need of the doctrine of the Gospel. The particle
   hoti is explained in two ways, but the meaning I have given to it is
   the best, and agrees better with the context.

   14 I have written unto you, fathers These repetitions I deem
   superfluous; and it is probable that when unskillful readers falsely
   thought that he spoke twice of little children, they rashly introduced
   the other two clauses. It might at the same time be that John himself,
   for the sake of amplifying, inserted the second time the sentence
   respecting the young men, (for he adds, that they were strong, which he
   had not said before;) but that the copyists presumptuously filled up
   the number. [67]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [66] The diminutive termination often expresses affection; hence
   neaniskoi may properly be rendered, "dear youth," or "dear young men;"
   and so teknia mou, in the first verse, may be rendered, "My dear
   children." -- Ed

   [67] There are no different readings that can justify the supposition
   of an interpolation. The only reading that Griesbach considers probable
   is egrapsa for grapho at the end of the 13th verse. If that be adopted,
   then the three characters are twice mentioned, and in regular order.
   The objection that teknia in ver. 12, is paidia in ver. 13, is not
   valid, for he uses the latter in the same sense as the former in ver.
   18, as denoting Christians in general; while here, in connection with
   "fathers" and "young men," they must mean those young in years or in
   the profession of the gospel. The repetition is for the sake of
   emphasis. -- Ed

   1 John 2:15-17

   15. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If
   any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

   15. Ne diligatis mundum, neque ea quae in mundo sunt: si quis diligit
   mundum non est charitas Patris in eo.

   16. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust
   of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the
   world.

   16. Quia quicquid est in mundo (nempe concupiscentia carnis,
   concupiscentia oculorum, et superbia vitae) non est ex Patre, sed ex
   mundo est.

   17. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth
   the will of God abideth for ever.

   17. Atqui mundus transit, et concupiscentia ejus; qui autem facit
   voluntatem Dei manet in aeternum.


   15 Love not He had said before that the only rule for living
   religiously, is to love God; but as, when we are occupied with the vain
   love of the world, we turn away all our thoughts and affections another
   way, this vanity must first be torn away from us, in order that the
   love of God may reign within us. Until our minds are cleansed, the
   former doctrine may be iterated a hundred times, but with no effect: it
   would be like pouring water on a ball; you can gather, no, not a drop,
   because there is no empty place to retain water. [68]

   By the world understand everything connected with the present life,
   apart from the kingdom of God and the hope of eternal life. So he
   includes in it corruptions of every kind, and the abyss of all evils.
   In the world are pleasures, delights, and all those allurements by
   which man is captivated, so as to withdraw himself from God. [69]

   Moreover, the love of the world is thus severely condemned, because we
   must necessarily forget God and ourselves when we regard nothing so
   much as the earth; and when a corrupt lust of this kind rules in man,
   and so holds him entangled that he thinks not of the heavenly life, he
   is possessed by a beastly stupidity.

   If any man love the world He proves by an argument from what is
   contrary, how necessary it is to cast away the love of the world, if we
   wish to please God; and this he afterwards confirms by an argument
   drawn from what is inconsistent; for what belongs to the world is
   wholly at variance with God. We must bear in mind what I have already
   said, that a corrupt mode of life is here mentioned, which has nothing
   in common with the kingdom of God, that is, when men become so
   degenerated, that they are satisfied with the present life, and think
   no more of immortal life than mute animals. Whosoever, then, makes
   himself thus a slave to earthly lusts, cannot be of God.

   16 The lust of the flesh, or, namely, the lust of the flesh. The old
   interpreter renders the verse otherwise, for from one sentence he makes
   two. Those Greek authors do better, who read these words together,
   "Whatever is in the world is not of God;" and then the three kinds of
   lusts they introduce parenthetically. For John, by way of explanation,
   inserted these three particulars as examples, that he might briefly
   shew what are the pursuits and thoughts of men who live for the world;
   but whether it be a full and complete division, it does not signify
   much; though you will not find a worldly man in whom these lusts do not
   prevail, at least one of them. It remains for us to see what he
   understands by each of these.

   The first clause is commonly explained of all sinful lusts in general;
   for the flesh means the whole corrupt nature of man. Though I am
   unwilling to contend, yet I am unwilling to dissemble that I approve of
   another meaning. Paul, when forbidding, in Romans 13:14, to make
   provision for the flesh as to its lusts, seems to me to be the best
   interpreter of this place. What, then, is the flesh there? even the
   body and all that belongs to it. What, then, is the lust or desire of
   the flesh, but when worldly men, seeking to live softly and delicately,
   are intent only on their own advantages? Well known from Cicero and
   others, is the threefold division made by Epicurus; for he made this
   difference between lusts; he made some natural and necessary, some
   natural and not necessary, and some neither natural nor necessary. But
   John, well knowing the insubordination (ataxia)of the human heart
   unhesitantly condemns the lust of the flesh, because it always flows
   out immoderately, and never observes any due medium. He afterwards
   comes gradually to grosser vices.

   The lust of the eyes He includes, as I think, libidinous looks as well
   as the vanity which delights in pomps and empty splendor.

   In the last place follows pride or haughtiness; with which is connected
   ambition, boasting, contempt of others, blind love of self, headstrong
   self-confidence.

   The sum of the whole is, that as soon as the world presents itself, our
   lusts or desires, when our heart is corrupt, are captivated by it, like
   unbridled wild beasts; so that various lusts, all which are adverse to
   God, bear rule in us. The Greek word, bios rendered life, (vita,) means
   the way or manner of living.

   17 And the world passeth away As there is nothing in the world but what
   is fading, and as it were for a moment, he hence concludes that they
   who seek their happiness from it, make a wretched and miserable
   provision for themselves, especially when God calls us to the ineffable
   glory of eternal life; as though he had said, "The true happiness which
   God offers to his children, is eternal; it is then a shameful thing for
   us to be entangled with the world, which with all its benefits will
   soon vanish away." I take lust here metonymically, as signifying what
   is desired or coveted, or what captivates the desires of men. The
   meaning is, that what is most precious in the world and deemed
   especially desirable, is nothing but a shadowy phantom.

   By saying that they who do the will of God shall abide for ever, or
   perpetually, he means that they who seek God shall be perpetually
   blessed. Were any one to object and say, that no one doeth what God
   commands, the obvious answer is, that what is spoken of here is not the
   perfect keeping of the law, but the obedience of faith, which, however
   imperfect it may be, is yet approved by God. The will of God is first
   made known to us in the law; but as no one satisfies the law, no
   happiness can be hoped from it. But Christ comes to meet the despairing
   with new aid, who not only regenerates us by his Spirit that we may
   obey God, but makes also that our endeavor, such as it is, should
   obtain the praise of perfect righteousness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [68] It is considered by many, such as Macknight and Scott, that the
   three former verses are connected with this -- that the particulars
   stated with regard to little children, fathers, and young men, are
   adduced as reasons to enforce this exhortation, "Love not the world,"
   etc. And this no doubt is the best view of the passage. -- Ed.

   [69] There are two things, the world, and the things that are in the
   world. The world, thus distinguished from what is in it, means,
   according to Macknight, the wicked and unbelieving, the men of the
   world, as when our Savior says, "the world," that is, the unbelieving
   Jews, "hateth you," John 15:19. According to this view, the contrast in
   verse 17 appears very suitable, "The world (the ungodly men of the
   world) passeth away, and its lust, (their lust;) but he that doeth the
   will of God abideth for ever." Others think that the blessings of the
   world are meant, the good things necessary for the support of man, and
   that these are not to be loved, though they may be rightly used. In
   this case, "in the world" must have a different meaning, a thing not
   unusual in Scripture; it must mean in the present state of things. But
   the most consistent view is the first, that is, to take "the world"
   throughout as signifying the ungodly men of the world. What prevail
   among them are the lusts here mentioned, -- sensual gratification,
   avarice, and ambition, the three gods who rule and reign in mankind. --
   Ed.

   1 John 2:18-19

   18. Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that
   antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we
   know that it is the last time.

   18. Filioli, novissima hora est; et sicut audistis quod Antichristus
   venturus sit, etiam nunc Antichristi multi coeperunt esse: unde scimus
   esse novissimam horam.

   19. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had
   been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went
   out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.

   19. Ex nobis egressi sunt, sed non erant ex nobis; nam si fuissent ex
   nobis, permansissent utique nobiscum; sed ut manifesti fierent quod non
   erant omnes ex nobis.


   18 It is the last time, or hour. He confirms the faithful against
   offenses by which they might have been disturbed. Already many sects
   had risen up, which rent the unity of faith and caused disorder in the
   churches. But the Apostle not only fortifies the faithful, lest they
   should falter, but turns the whole to a contrary purpose; for he
   reminds them that the last time had already come, and therefore he
   exhorts them to a greater vigilance, as though he had said, "Whilst
   various errors arise, it behooves you to be awakened rather than to be
   overwhelmed; for we ought hence to conclude that Christ is not far
   distant; let us then attentively look for him, lest he should come upon
   us suddenly." In the same way it behooves us to comfort ourselves at
   this day, and to see by faith the near advent of Christ, while Satan is
   causing confusion for the sake of disturbing the Church, for these are
   the signs of the last time.

   But so many ages having passed away since the death of John, seem to
   prove that this prophecy is not true: to this I answer, that the
   Apostle, according to the common mode adopted in the Scripture,
   declares to the faithful, that nothing more now remained but that
   Christ should appear for the redemption of the world. But as he fixes
   no time, he did not allure the men of that age by a vain hope, nor did
   he intend to cut short in future the course of the Church and the many
   successions of years during which the Church has hitherto remained in
   the world. And doubtless, if the eternity of God's kingdom be borne in
   mind, so long a time will appear to us as a moment. We must understand
   the design of the Apostle, that he calls that the last time, during
   which all things shall be so completed, that nothing will remain except
   the last revelation of Christ.

   As ye have heard that antichrist will come He speaks as of a thing well
   known. We may hence conclude that the faithful had been taught and
   warned from the beginning respecting the future disorder of the Church,
   in order that they might, carefully keep themselves in the faith they
   professed, and also instruct posterity in the duty of watchfulness. For
   it was God's will that his Church should be thus tried, lest any one
   knowingly and willingly should be deceived, and that there might be no
   excuse for ignorance. But we see that almost the whole world has been
   miserably deceived, as though not a word had been said about
   Antichrist.

   Moreover, under the Papacy there is nothing more notorious and common
   than the future coming of Antichrist; and yet they are so stupid, that
   they perceive not that his tyranny is exercised over them. Indeed, the
   same thing happens altogether to them as to the Jews; for though they
   hold the promises respecting the Messiah, they are yet further away
   from Christ than if they had never heard his name; for the imaginary
   Messiah, whom they have invented for themselves, turns them wholly
   aside from the Son of God; and were any one to shew Christ to them from
   the Law and the Prophets, he would only spend his labor in vain. The
   Popes have imagined an Antichrist, who for three years and a half is to
   harass the Church. All the marks by which the Spirit of God has pointed
   out Antichrist, clearly appear in the Pope; but the triennial
   Antichrist lays fast hold on the foolish Papists, so that seeing they
   do not see. Let us then remember, that Antichrist has not only been
   announced by the Spirit of God, but that also the marks by which he may
   be distinguished have been mentioned.

   Even now are there many antichrists. This may seem to have been added
   by way of correction, as they falsely thought that it would be some one
   kingdom; but it is not so. They who suppose that he would be only one
   man, are indeed greatly mistaken. For Paul, referring to a future
   defection, plainly shows that it would be a certain body or kingdom. (2
   Thessalonians 2:3.) He first predicts a defection that would prevail
   through the whole Church, as a universal evil; he then makes the head
   of the apostasy the adversary of Christ, who would sit in the temple of
   God, claiming for himself divinity and divine honors. Except we desire
   willfully to err, we may learn from Paul's description to know
   Antichrist. That passage I have already explained; it is enough now
   touch on it by the way.

   But how can that passage agree with the words of John, who says that
   there were already many antichrists? To this I reply, that John meant
   no other thing than to say, that some particular sects had already
   risen, which were forerunners of a future Antichrist; for Cerinthus,
   Basilides, Marcion, Valentinus, Ebion, Arrius, and others, were members
   of that kingdom which the Devil afterwards raised up in opposition to
   Christ. Properly speaking, Antichrist was not yet in existence; but the
   mystery of iniquity was working secretly. But John uses the name, that
   he might effectually stimulate the care and solicitude of the godly to
   repel frauds.

   But if the Spirit of God even then commanded the faithful to stand on
   their watch, when they saw at a distance only signs of the coming
   enemy, much less is it now a time for sleeping, when he holds the
   Church under his cruel and oppressive tyranny, and openly dishonors
   Christ.

   19 They went out from us He anticipates another objection, that the
   Church seemed to have produced these pests, and to have cherished them
   for a time in its bosom. For certainly it serves more to disturb the
   weak, when any one among us, professing the true faith, falls away,
   than when a thousand aliens conspire against us. He then confesses that
   they had gone out from the bosom of the Church; but he denies that they
   were ever of the Church. But the way of removing this objection is, to
   say, that the Church is always exposed to this evil, so that it is
   constrained to bear with many hypocrites who know not Christ, really,
   however much they may by the mouth profess his name.

   By saying, They went out from us, he means that they had previously
   occupied a place in the Church, and were counted among the number of
   the godly. He, however, denies that they were of them, though they had
   assumed the name of believers, as chaff though mixed with wheat on the
   same floor cannot yet be deemed wheat.

   For if they had been of us He plainly declares that those who fell away
   had never been members of the Church. And doubtless the seal of God,
   under which he keeps his own, remains sure, as Paul says, (2 Timothy
   2:19.) But here arises a difficulty, for it happens that many who
   seemed to have embraced Christ, often fall away. To this I answer, that
   there are three sorts of those who profess the Gospel; there are those
   who feign piety, while a bad conscience reproves them within; the
   hypocrisy of others is more deceptive, who not only seek to disguise
   themselves before men, but also dazzle their own eyes, so that they
   seem to themselves to worship God aright; the third are those who have
   the living root of faith, and carry a testimony of their own adoption
   firmly fixed in their hearts. The two first have no stability; of the
   last John speaks, when he says, that it is impossible that they should
   be separated from the Church, for the seal which God's Spirit engraves
   on their hearts cannot be obliterated; the incorruptible seed, which
   has struck roots, cannot be pulled up or destroyed.

   He does not speak here of the constancy of men, but of God, whose
   election must be ratified. He does not then, without reason declare,
   that where the calling of God is effectual, perseverance would be
   certain. He, in short, means that they who fall away had never been
   thoroughly imbued with the knowledge of Christ, but had only a light
   and a transient taste of it.

   That they might be made manifest He shews that trial is useful and
   necessary for the Church. It hence follows, on the other hand, that
   there is no just cause for perturbation. Since the Church is like a
   threshing-floor, the chaff must be blown away that the pure wheat may
   remain. This is what God does, when he casts out hypocrites from the
   Church, for he then cleanses it from refuse and filth.

   1 John 2:20-23

   20. But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.

   20. Et vos unctionem habetis a Sancto, et novistis omnia.

   21. I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but
   because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.

   21. Non scripsi vobis, quia non noveritis veritatem; sed quia novistis
   eam, et quia omne mendacium ex veritate non est.

   22. Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is
   antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.

   22. Quis est mendax, nisi qui negat Jesum esse Christum? Hic est
   antichristus, qui negat Patrem et Filium.

   23. Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he
   that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.

   23. Omnis qui negat Filium, neque Patrem habet.


   20 But ye have an unction. The Apostle modestly excuses himself for
   having so earnestly warned them, lest they should think that they were
   indirectly reproved, as though they were rude and ignorant of those
   things which they ought to have well known. So Paul conceded wisdom to
   the Romans, that they were able and fit to admonish others. He at the
   same time shewed that they stood in need of being reminded, in order
   that they might rightly perform their duty. (Romans 15:14, 15.) The
   Apostles did not, however, speak thus in order to flatter them; but
   they thus wisely took heed lest their doctrine should be rejected by
   any, for they declared what was suitable and useful, not only to the
   ignorant, but also to those well instructed in the Lord's school.

   Experience teaches us how fastidious the ears of men are. Such
   fastidiousness ought indeed to be far away from the godly; it yet
   behooves a faithful and wise teacher to omit nothing by which he may
   secure a hearing from all. And it is certain that we receive what is
   said with less attention and respect, when we think that he who speaks
   disparages the knowledge which has been given us by the Lord. The
   Apostle by this praise did at the same time stimulate his readers,
   because they who were endued with the gift of knowledge, had less
   excuse if they did not surpass others in their proficiency.

   The state of the case is, that the Apostle did not teach them as though
   they were ignorant, and acquainted only with the first elements of
   knowledge, but reminded them of things already known, and also exhorted
   them to rouse up the sparks of the Spirit, that a full brightness might
   shine forth in them. And in the next words he explained himself, having
   denied that he wrote to them because they knew not the truth, but
   because they had been well taught in it; for had they been wholly
   ignorant and novices, they could not have comprehended his doctrine.

   Now, when he says that they knew all things, it is not to be taken in
   the widest sense, but ought to be confined to the subject treated of
   here. But when he says that they had an unction from the Holy One, he
   alludes, no doubt, to the ancient types. The oil by which the priests
   were anointed was obtained from the sanctuary; and Daniel mentions the
   coming of Christ as the proper time for anointing the Most Holy.
   (Daniel 9:24.) For he was anointed by the Father, that he might pour
   forth on us a manifold abundance from his own fullness. It hence
   follows that men are not rightly made wise by the acumen of their own
   minds, but by the illumination of the Spirit; and further, that we are
   not otherwise made partakers of the Spirit than through Christ, who is
   the true sanctuary and our only high priest. [70]

   21 And that no lie is of the truth. He concedes to them a judgment, by
   which they could distinguish truth from falsehood; for it is not the
   dialectic proposition, that falsehood differs from truth, (such as are
   taught as general rules in the schools;) but what is said is applied to
   that which is practical and useful; as though he had said, that they
   did not only hold what was true, but were also so fortified against the
   impostures and fallacies of the ungodly, that they wisely took heed to
   themselves. Besides, he speaks not of this or of that kind of
   falsehood; but he says, that whatever deception Satan might contrive,
   or in whatever way he might attack them, they would be able readily to
   distinguish between light and darkness, because they had the Spirit as
   their guide.

   22 Who is a liar He does not assert that they alone were liars who
   denied that the Son of God appeared in the flesh, lest no one in
   unloosing the knot should above measure torment himself; but that they
   surpassed all others, as though he had said, that except this be deemed
   a lie, no other could be so reckoned; as we are wont commonly to say,
   "If perfidy towards God and men is not a crime, what else can we call a
   crime?" [71]

   What he had generally said of false prophets, he now applies to the
   state of his own time; for he points out, as by the finger, those who
   disturbed the Church. I readily agree with the ancients, who thought
   that Cerinthus and Carpocrates are here referred to. But the denial of
   Christ extends much wider; for it is not enough in words to confess
   that Jesus is the Christ, except he is acknowledged to be such as the
   Father offers him to us in the gospel. The two I have named gave the
   title of Christ to the Son of God, but imagined him to be man only.
   Others followed them, such as Arius, who, adorning him with the name of
   God, robbed him of his eternal divinity. Marcion dreamt that he was a
   mere phantom. Sabellius imagined that he differed nothing from the
   Father. All these denied the Son of God; for not one of them really
   acknowledged the true Christ; but, adulterating, as far as they could,
   the truth respecting him, they devised for themselves an idol instead
   of Christ. Then broke out Pelagius, who, indeed, raised no dispute
   respecting Christ's essence, but allowed him to be true man and God;
   yet he transferred to us almost all the honor that belongs to him. It
   is, indeed, to reduce Christ to nothing, when his grace and power are
   set aside.

   So the Papists, at this day, setting up freewill in opposition to the
   grace of the Holy Spirit, ascribing a part of their righteousness and
   salvation to the merits of works, feigning for themselves innumerable
   advocates, by whom they render God propitious to them, have a sort of
   fictitious Christ, I know not what; but the lively and genuine image of
   God, which shines forth in Christ, they deform by their wicked
   inventions; they lessen his power, subvert and pervert his office.

   We now see that Christ, is denied, whenever those things which
   peculiarly belong to him, are taken away from him. And as Christ is the
   end of the law and of the gospel, and has in himself all the treasures
   of wisdom and knowledge, so he is the mark at which all heretics level
   and direct their arrows. Therefore the Apostle does not, without
   reason, make those the chief impostors, who fight against Christ, in
   whom the full truth is exhibited to us.

   He is Antichrist He speaks not of that prince of defection who was to
   occupy the seat of God; but all those who seek to overthrow Christ, he
   puts them among that impious band. And that he might amplify their
   crime, he asserts that the Father, no less than the Son, is denied by
   them; as though he had said, "They have no longer any religion, because
   they wholly cast away God." And this he afterwards confirms, by adding
   this reason, that the Father cannot be separated from the Son.

   Now this is a remarkable sentence, and ought to be reckoned among the
   first axioms of our religion. yea, when we have confessed that there is
   one true God, this second article ought necessarily to be added, that
   he is no other but he who is made known in Christ. The Apostle does not
   here treat distinctly of the unity of essence. It is, indeed, certain,
   that the Son cannot be disunited from the Father, for he is of the same
   essence, (homoousios;) but another thing is spoken of here, that is,
   that the Father, who is invisible, has revealed himself only in his
   Son. Hence he is called the image of the Father, (Hebrews 1:3,) because
   he sets forth and exhibits to us all that is necessary to be known of
   the Father. For the naked majesty of God would, by its immense
   brightness, ever dazzle our eyes; it is therefore necessary for us to
   look on Christ. This is to come to the light, which is justly said to
   be otherwise inaccessible.

   I say, again, that there is not here a distinct discussion respecting
   the eternal essence of Christ, which he has in common with the Father.
   This passage is, indeed, abundantly sufficient to prove it: but John
   calls us to this practical part of faith, that as God has given himself
   to us to be enjoyed only in Christ, he is elsewhere sought for in vain;
   or (if any one prefers what is clearer) that as in Christ dwells all
   the fullness of the Deity, there is no God apart from him. It hence
   follows, that Turks, Jews, and such as are like them, have a mere idol
   and not the true God. For by whatever titles they may honor the God
   whom they worship, still, as they reject him without whom they cannot
   come to God, and in whom God has really manifested himself to us, what
   have they but some creature or fiction of their own? They may flatter
   themselves as much as they please, with their own speculations, who,
   without Christ, philosophize on divine things; it is still certain that
   they do nothing but rave and rant, because, as Paul says, they hold not
   the Head. (Colossians 2:19.) It is obvious, hence, to conclude how
   necessary is the knowledge of Christ.

   Many copies have the opposite sentence, "He who confesses the Son,"
   etc. But as I think that a note by some copyist has crept into the
   text, I hesitated not to omit it. [72] But if its insertion be
   approved, the meaning would be, that there is no right confession of
   God except the Father be acknowledged in the Son.

   Were any one to object and say, that many of the ancients thought
   rightly of God, to whom Christ was not known: I allow that the
   knowledge of Christ has not been always so explicitly revealed,
   nevertheless, I contend that it has been always true, that as the light
   of the sun comes to us by its rays, so the knowledge of God has been
   communicated through Christ.

   [70] "From the Holy One," from the Father, say some; from the Son, say
   others; from the Holy Spirit, according to a third party. By comparing
   this verse with the 27th and the 28th verse, we see reason to conclude
   that the "Holy One" is Christ, who had promised the Spirit to teach his
   people. The unction, or the anointing, is the act of the Spirit by
   which the truth is taught. -- Ed.

   [71] Taking this view of the passage, we may give this rendering, --
   "Who is a liar, except it be he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?"
   -- Ed.

   [72] The words are found in most of the MSS., and in most of the
   versions, and in many of the Fathers. Besides, they wholly comport with
   the usual style of the Apostle, whose common practice it was to state
   things positively and negatively, and vice versa. Sec especially chap.

   1 John 2:24-29

   24. Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the
   beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain
   in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.

   24. Ergo quod audistis ab initio, in vobis maneat: si in vobis manserit
   quod ab initio audistis, et vos in Patre et Filio manebitis.

   25. And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal
   life.

   25. Atque haec est promissio, quam ipse nobis promisit, nempe vitae
   eternae (vel, quam nobis pollicitus est vitam eternam.)

   26. These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce
   you.

   26. Haec scripsi vobis de iis qui seducunt vos.

   27. But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and
   ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth
   you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath
   taught you, ye shall abide in him.

   27. Et unctio quam accepistis ab eo, in vobis manet; neque opus habetis
   ut quis vos doceat; sed quemadmodum unctio docet vos de omnibus, et
   veritas est, et non est mendacium; et quemadmodum docuit vos, manete in
   eo (vel, in ea.)

   28. And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear,
   we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

   28. Et nunc filioli, manete in eo, ut quum apparuerit, habeamus
   fiduciam, neque pudefiamus ab ejus praesentia.

   29. If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth
   righteousness is born of him.

   29. Si nostis quod justus sit, cognoscite quod quisquis facit justitiam
   ex eo genitus est.


   24 Let that therefore abide in you He annexes an exhortation to the
   former doctrine; and that it might have more weight, he points out the
   fruit they would receive from obedience. He then exhorts them to
   perseverance in the faith, so that they might retain fixed in their
   hearts what they had learnt.

   But when he says, from the beginning, he does not mean that antiquity
   alone was sufficient to prove any doctrine true; but as he has already
   shown that they had been rightly instructed in the pure gospel of
   Christ, he concludes that they ought of right to continue in it. And
   this order ought to be especially noticed; for were we unwilling to
   depart from that doctrine which we have once embraced, whatever it may
   be, this would not be perseverance, but perverse obstinacy. Hence,
   discrimination ought to be exercised, so that a reason for our faith
   may be made evident from God's word: then let inflexible perseverance
   follow.

   The Papists boast of "a beginning," because they have imbibed their
   superstitions from childhood. Under this pretense they allow themselves
   obstinately to reject the plain truth. Such perverseness shews to us,
   that we ought always to begin with the certainty of truth.

   In that which ye have heard Here is the fruit of perseverance, that
   they in whom God's truth remains, remain in God. We hence learn what we
   are to seek in every truth pertaining to religion. He therefore makes
   the greatest proficiency, who makes such progress as wholly to cleave
   to God. But he in whom the Father dwells not through his Son, is
   altogether vain and empty, whatever knowledge he may possess. Moreover,
   this is the highest commendation of sound doctrine, that it unites us
   to God, and that in it is found whatever pertains to the real fruition
   of God.

   In the last place, he reminds us that it is real happiness when God
   dwells in us. The words he uses are ambiguous. They may be rendered,
   "This is the promise which he has promised to us, even eternal life."
   [73] You may, however, adopt either of these renderings, for the
   meaning is still the same. The sum of what is said is, that we cannot
   live otherwise than by nourishing to the end the seed of life sown in
   our hearts. John insists much on this point, that not only the
   beginning of a blessed life is to be found in the knowledge of Christ,
   but also its perfection. But no repetition of it can be too much, since
   it is well known that it has ever been a cause of ruin to men, that
   being not content with Christ, they have had a hankering to wander
   beyond the simple doctrine of the gospel.

   26 These things have I written unto you The apostle excuses himself
   again for having admonished them who were well endued with knowledge
   and judgment. But he did this, that they might apply for the guidance
   of the Spirit, lest his admonition should be in vain; as though he had
   said, "I indeed do my part, but still it is necessary that the Spirit
   of God should direct you in all things; for in vain shall I, by the
   sound of my voice, beat your ears, or rather the air, unless he speaks
   within you."

   When we hear that he wrote concerning seducers, we ought always to bear
   in mind, that it is the duty of a good and diligent pastor not only to
   gather a flock, but also to drive away wolves' for what will it avail
   to proclaim the pure gospel, if we connive at the impostures of Satan?
   No one, then, can faithfully teach the Church, except he is diligent in
   banishing errors whenever he finds them spread by seducers. What he
   says of the unction having been received from him, I refer to Christ.

   27 And ye need not Strange must have been the purpose of John, as I
   have already said, if he intended to represent teaching as useless. He
   did not ascribe to them so much wisdom, as to deny that they were the
   scholars of Christ. He only meant that they were by no means so
   ignorant as to need things as it were unknown to be taught them, and
   that he did not set before them anything which the Spirit of God might
   not of himself suggest to them. Absurdly, then, do fanatical men lay
   hold on this passage, in order to exclude from the Church the use of
   the outward ministry. He says that the faithful, taught by the Spirit,
   already understood what he delivered to them, so that they had no need
   to learn things unknown to them. He said this, that he might add more
   authority to his doctrine, while every one repeated in his heart an
   assent to it, engraven as it were by the finger of God. But as every
   one had knowledge according to the measure of his faith, and as faith
   in some was small, in others stronger, and in none perfect, it hence
   follows, that no one knew so much, that there was no room for progress.

   There is also another use to be made of this doctrine, -- that when men
   really understand what is needful for them, we are yet to warn and
   rouse them, that they may be more confirmed. For what John says, that
   they were taught all things by the Spirit, ought not to be taken
   generally, but to be confined to what is contained in this passage. He
   had, in short, no other thing in view than to strengthen their faith,
   while he recalled them to the examination of the Spirit, who is the
   only fit corrector and approver of doctrine, who seals it on our
   hearts, so that we may certainly know that God speaks. For while faith
   ought to look to God, he alone can be a witness to himself, so as to
   convince our hearts that what our ears receive has come from him.

   And the same is the meaning of these words, As the same anointing
   teaches you of all things, and is truth; that is, the Spirit is like a
   seal, by which the truth of God is testified to you. When he adds, and
   is no lie, he points out another office of the Spirit, even that he
   endues us with judgment and discernment, lest we should be deceived by
   lies, lest we should hesitate and be perplexed, lest we should
   vacillate as in doubtful things.

   As it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him, or, abide in him. He had
   said, that the Spirit abode in them; he now exhorts them to abide in
   the revelation made by him, and he specifies what revelation it was,
   "Abide," he says, "in Christ, as the Spirit hath taught you." Another
   explanation, I know, is commonly given, "Abide in it," that is, the
   unction. But as the repetition which immediately follows, cannot apply
   to any but to Christ, I have no doubt but that he speaks here also of
   Christ; and this is required by the context; for the Apostle dwells
   much on this point, that the faithful should retain the true knowledge
   of Christ, and that they should not go to God in any other way.

   He at the same time shews, that the children of God are for no other
   end illuminated by the Spirit, but that they may know Christ. Provided
   they turned not aside from him, he promised them the fruit of
   perseverance, even confidence, so as not to be ashamed at his presence.
   For faith is not a naked and a frigid apprehension of Christ, but a
   lively and real sense of his power, which produces confidence. Indeed,
   faith cannot stand, while tossed daily by so many waves, except it
   looks to the coming of Christ, and, supported by his power, brings
   tranquillity to the conscience. But the nature of confidence is well
   expressed, when he says that it can boldly sustain the presence of
   Christ. For they who indulge securely in their vices, turn their backs
   as it were on God; nor can they otherwise obtain peace than by
   forgetting him. This is the security of the flesh, which stupefies men;
   so that turning away from God, they neither dread sin nor fear death;
   and in the meantime they shun the tribunal of Christ. But a godly
   confidence delights to look on God. Hence it is, that the godly calmly
   wait for Christ, nor do they dread his coming.

   29. If ye know that he is righteous He again passes on to exhortations,
   so that he mingles these continually with doctrine throughout the
   Epistle; but he proves by many arguments that faith is necessarily
   connected with a holy and pure life. The first argument is, that we are
   spiritually begotten after the likeness of Christ; it hence follows,
   that no one is born of Christ but he who lives righteously. It is at
   the same time uncertain whether he means Christ or God, when he says
   that they who are born of him do righteousness. It is a mode of
   speaking certainly used in Scripture, that we are born of God in
   Christ; but there is nothing inconsistent in the other, that they are
   born of Christ, who are renewed by his Spirit. [74]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [73] This, which is our version, is, no doubt, the best construction.
   "Promise" is a metonymy for what is promised: "This is the promise,
   which he hath promised to us, even eternal life." "Eternal life" is in
   apposition with "which." -- Ed.

   [74] It is the character of John's style that he often passes as it
   were abruptly from the Son to the Father, and from the Father to the
   Son; and often the antecedent is not the next preceding word, but one
   at some distance: we find this to be the case by what the sentence
   contains, as in the present instance; the new birth is never ascribed
   to the Son, referred to in the foregoing verse, but to the Father or to
   the Spirit. Hence we must conclude that the righteous one spoken of
   here, who together with the Son is mentioned in the 22d verse, is the
   Father. As the intervening verses, with the exception of the 23d, which
   is only explanatory of the previous verse, apply to the Son, so this
   verse seems to refer to the Father, consistently with a mode of writing
   common in Scripture. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 John 3:1-3

   1. Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
   we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us
   not, because it knew him not.

   1. Videte (vel, videtis) qualem charitatem dedit nobis Pater, ut filii
   Dei nominemur: propterea mundus non novit nos, quia non novit ipsum.

   2. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what
   we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like
   him; for we shall see him as he is.

   2. Dilecti, nunc filii Dei sumus; et nondum apparuit quid erimus:
   scimus antera quod si apparuerit, similes ei erimus; quia videbimus eum
   sicuti est.

   3. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as
   he is pure.

   3. Et omnis qui habet hanc spem in eo, purificat seipsum, quemadmodum
   ille purus est.


   1 Behold The second argument is from the dignity and excellency of our
   calling; for it was not common honor, he says, that the heavenly Father
   bestowed on us, when he adopted us as his children. This being so great
   a favor, the desire for purity ought to be kindled in us, so as to be
   conformed to his image; nor, indeed, can it be otherwise, but that he
   who acknowledges himself to be one of God's children should purify
   himself. And to make this exhortation more forcible, he amplifies the
   favor of God; for when he says, that love has been bestowed, he means
   that it is from mere bounty and benevolence that God makes us his
   children; for whence comes to us such a dignity, except from the love
   of God? Love, then, is declared here to be gratuitous. There is,
   indeed, an impropriety in the language; but the Apostle preferred
   speaking thus rather than not to express what was necessary to be
   known. He, in short, means that the more abundantly God's goodness has
   been manifested towards us, the greater are our obligations to him,
   according to the teaching of Paul, when he besought the Romans by the
   mercies of God to present themselves as pure sacrifices to him. (Romans
   12:1.) We are at the same time taught, as I have said, that the
   adoption of all the godly is gratuitous, and does not depend on any
   regard to works.

   What the sophists say, that God foresees those who are worthy to be
   adopted, is plainly refuted by these words, for, in this way the gift
   would not be gratuitous. It behooves us especially to understand this
   doctrine; for since the only cause of our salvation is adoption, and
   since the Apostle testifies that this flows from the mere love of God
   alone, there is nothing left to our worthiness or to the merits of
   works. For why are we sons? Even because God began to love us freely,
   when we deserved hatred rather than love. And as the Spirit is a pledge
   of our adoption, it hence follows, that if there be any good in us, it
   ought not to be set up in opposition to the grace of God, but, on the
   contrary, to be ascribed to him.

   When he says that we are called, or named, the expression is not
   without its meaning; for it is God who with his own mouth declares us
   to be sons, as he gave a name to Abraham according to what he was. [75]

   Therefore the world It is a trial that grievously assaults our faith,
   that we are not so much regarded as God's children, or that no mark of
   so great an excellency appears in us, but that, on the contrary, almost
   the whole world treats us with ridicule and contempt. Hence it can
   hardly be inferred from our present state that God is a Father to us,
   for the devil so contrives all things as to obscure this benefit. He
   obviates this offense by saying that we are not as yet acknowledged to
   be such as we are, because the world knows not God: a remarkable
   example of this very thing is found in Isaac and Jacob; for though both
   were chosen by God, yet Ishmael persecuted the former with laughter and
   taunts; and Esau, the latter with threats and the sword. However, then,
   we may be oppressed by the world, still our salvation remains safe and
   secure.

   2 Now are we the sons of God He comes now to what every one knows and
   feels himself; for though the ungodly may not entice us to give up our
   hope, yet our present condition is very short of the glow of God's
   children; for as to our body we are dust and a shadow, and death is
   always before our eyes; we are also subject to thousand miseries, and
   the soul is exposed to innumerable evils; so that we find always a hell
   within us. The more necessary it is that all our thoughts should be
   withdrawn from the present view of things, lest the miseries by which
   we are on every side surrounded and almost overwhelmed, should shake
   our faith in that felicity which as yet lies hid. For the Apostle's
   meaning is this, that we act very foolishly when we estimate what God
   has bestowed on us according to the present state of things, but that
   we ought with undoubting faith to hold to that which does not yet
   appear.

   But we know that when he shall appear The conditional particle ought to
   be rendered as an adverb of time, when But the verb appear means not
   the same thing as when he used it before. The Apostle has just said, it
   does not yet appear what we shall be, because the fruit of our adoption
   is as yet hid, for in heaven is our felicity, and we are now far away
   traveling on the earth; for this fading life, constantly exposed to
   hundred deaths, is far different from that eternal life which belongs
   to the children of God; for being enclosed as slaves in the prison of
   our flesh, we are far distant from the full sovereignty of heaven and
   earth. But the verb now refers to Christ, when, he shall appear; for he
   teaches the same thing with Paul, in Colossians, where he says,

   "Your life is hid with Christ in God: when Christ, who is your life,
   shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory."
   (Colossians 3:3,4)

   For our faith cannot stand otherwise than by looking to the coming of
   Christ. The reason why God defers the manifestation of our glory is
   this, because Christ is not manifested in the power of his kingdom.
   This, then, is the only way of sustaining our faith, so that we may
   wait patiently for the life promised to us. As soon as any one turns
   away the least from Christ, he must necessarily fail. [76]

   The word to know, shews the certainty of faith, in order to distinguish
   it from opinion. Neither simple nor universal knowledge is here
   intended, but that which every one ought to have for himself, so that
   he may feel assured that he will be sometime like Christ. Though, then,
   the manifestation of our glory is connected with the coming of Christ,
   yet our knowledge of this is well founded.

   We shall be like him He does not understand that we shall be equal to
   him; for there must be some difference between the head and the
   members; but we shall be like him, because he will make our vile body
   conformable to his glorious body, as Paul also teaches us in
   Philippians 3:21. For the Apostle intended shortly to shew that the
   final end of our adoption is, that what has in order preceded in
   Christ, shall at length be completed in us.

   The reason that is added may, however, seem inappropriate. For if to
   see Christ makes us like him, we shall have this in common with the
   wicked, for they shall also see his glory. To this I reply, that this
   is to see him as a friend, which will not be the case with the wicked,
   for they will dread his presence; nay, they will shun God's presence,
   and be filled with terror; his glow will so dazzle their eyes, that
   they will be stupefied and confounded. For we see that Adam, conscious
   of having done wrong, dreaded the presence of God. And God declared
   this by Moses, as a general truth as to men,

   "No man shall see me and live." (Exodus 33:20.)

   For how can it be otherwise but that God's majesty, as a consuming
   fire, will consume us as though we were stubble, so great is the
   weakness of our flesh. But as far as the image of God is renewed in us,
   we have eyes prepared to see God. And now, indeed, God begins to renew
   in us his own image, but in what a small measure! Except then we be
   stripped of all the corruption of the flesh, we shall not be able to
   behold God face to face.

   And this is also expressed here, as he is He does not, indeed, say,
   that there is no seeing of God now; but as Paul says,

   "We see now through a glass, darkly."
   (1 Corinthians 13:12.)

   But he elsewhere makes a difference between this way of living, and the
   seeing of the eye. In short, God now presents himself to be seen by us,
   not such as he is, but such as we can comprehend. Thus is fulfilled
   what is said by Moses, that we see only as it were his back, (Exodus
   33:23;) for there is too much brightness in his face.

   We must further observe, that the manner which the Apostle mentions is
   taken from the effect, not from the cause; for he does not teach us,
   that we shall be like him, because we shall see him; but he hence
   proves that we shall be partakers of the divine glory, for except our
   nature were spiritual, and endued with a heavenly and blessed
   immortality, it could never come so nigh to God yet the perfection of
   glory will not be so great in us, that our seeing will enable us to
   comprehend all that God is; for the distance between us and him will be
   even then very great.

   But when the Apostle says, that we shall see him as he is, he intimates
   a new and an ineffable manner of seeing him, which we enjoy not now;
   for as long as we walk by faith, as Paul teaches us, we are absent from
   him. And when he appeared to the fathers, it was not in his own
   essence, but was ever seen under symbols. Hence the majesty of God, now
   hid, will then only be in itself seen, when the veil of this mortal and
   corruptible nature shall be removed.

   Refined questions I pass by: for we see how Augustine tormented himself
   with these, and yet never succeeded, both in his Epistles to Paulus and
   Fortunatus, and in the City of God, (2:2,) and in other places. What he
   says, however, is worthy of being observed, that the way in which we
   live avails more in this inquiry than the way in which we speak, and
   that we must beware, lest by wrangling as to the manner in which God
   can be seen, we lose that peace and holiness without which no one shall
   see him.

   3 And every man that hath this hope He now draws this inference, that
   the desire for holiness should not grow cold in us, because our
   happiness has not as yet appeared, for that hope is sufficient; and we
   know that what is hoped for is as yet hid. The meaning then is, that
   though we have not Christ now present before our eyes, yet if we hope
   in him, it cannot be but that this hope will excite and stimulate us to
   follow purity, for it leads us straight to Christ, whom we know to be a
   perfect pattern of purity.

   [75] Calvin, like our version, renders tekna, "sons;" but the word
   would be better rendered "children," "That we should be called the
   children of God." The passage might be thus paraphrased, "See what
   great proof of love the Father hath given us, that we should be made
   the children of God" -- Ed

   [76] "When he shall appear," refers to Christ, mentioned in the 28th
   verse of the last chapter; what intervenes seems to have been
   parenthetically introduced. This is often the manner of writing found
   in this apostle. The end of the 8th verse, in this chapter, is
   connected with the 16th; for the antecedent to ekeinos, he, in the
   latter verse, is "the Son of God" in the former. [1Jo 2:28; 3:8, 16.]

   1 John 3:4-6

   4. Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the
   transgression of the law.

   4. Quicunque facit peccatum, etiam iniquitatem facit; et peccatum est
   iniquitas.

   5. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him
   is no sin.

   5. Porro nostis quod ille apparuit ut peccata nostra tolleret; et
   peccatum in eo non est.

   6. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not
   seen him, neither known him.

   6. Quisquis in eo manet, non peccat; quisquis peccat, non vidit eum,
   nec novit eum.


   4 Whosoever committeth, or doeth, sin. The Apostle has already shown
   how ungrateful we must be to God, if we make but little account of the
   honor of adoption, by which he of his own goodwill anticipates us, and
   if we do not, at least, render him mutual love. He, at the same time,
   introduced this admonition, that our love ought not to be diminished,
   because the promised happiness is deferred. But now, as men are wont to
   indulge themselves more than they ought, in evils, he reproves this
   perverse indulgence, declaring that all they who sin are wicked and
   transgressors of the law. For it is probable that there were then those
   who extenuated their vices by this kind of flattery, "It is no wonder
   if we sin, because we are men; but there is a great difference between
   sin and iniquity."

   This frivolous excuse the Apostle now dissipates, when he defines sin
   to be a transgression of the divine law; for his object was to produce
   hatred and horror as to sin. The word sin seems light to some; but
   iniquity or transgression of the law cannot appear to be so easily
   forgiven. But the Apostle does not make sins equal, by charging all
   with iniquity who sin; but he means simply to teach us, that sin arises
   from a contempt of God, and that by sinning, the law is violated. Hence
   this doctrine of John has nothing in common with the delirious
   paradoxes of the Stoics.

   Besides, to sin here, does not mean to offend in some instances; nor is
   the word sin to be taken for every fault or wrong a man may commit.;
   but he calls that sin, when men with their whole heart run into evil,
   nor does he understand that men sin, except those who are given up to
   sin. For the faithful, who are as yet tempted by the lusts of the
   flesh, are not to be deemed guilty of iniquity, though they are not
   pure or free from sin, but as sin does not reign in them, John says
   that they do not sin, as I shall presently explain more fully.

   The import of the passage is, that the perverse life of those who
   indulge themselves in the liberty of sinning, is hateful to God, and
   cannot be borne with by him, because it is contrary to his Law. It does
   not hence follow, nor can it be hence inferred, that the faithful are
   iniquitous; because they desire to obey God, and abhor their own vices,
   and that in every instance; and they also form their own life, as much
   as in them lieth, according to the law. But when there is a deliberate
   purpose to sin, or a continued course in sin, then the law is
   transgressed. [77]

   5 And ye know that he was manifested, or, hath appeared. He shews by
   another argument how much sin and faith differ from one another; for it
   is the office of Christ to take away sins, and for this end was he sent
   by the Father; and it is by faith we partake of Christ's virtue. Then
   he who believes in Christ is necessarily cleansed from his sins. But it
   is said in John 1:29, that Christ takes away sins, because he atoned
   for them by the sacrifice of his death, that they may not be imputed to
   us before God: John means in this place that Christ really, and, so to
   speak, actually takes away sins, because through him our old man is
   crucified, and his Spirit, by means of repentance, mortifies the flesh
   with all its lusts. For the context does not allow us to explain this
   of the remission of sins; for, as I have said, he thus reasons, "They
   who cease not to sin, render void the benefits derived from Christ,
   since he came to destroy the reigning power of sin." This belongs to
   the sanctification of the Spirit.

   And in him is no sin He does not speak of Christ personally, but of his
   whole body. [78] Wherever Christ diffuses his efficacious grace, he
   denies that there is any more room for sin. He, therefore, immediately
   draws this inference, that they sin not who remain in Christ. For if he
   dwells in us by faith, he performs his own work, that is, he cleanses
   us from sins. It hence appears what it is to sin For Christ by his
   Spirit does not perfectly renew us at once, or in an instant, but he
   continues our renovation throughout life. It cannot then be but that
   the faithful are exposed to sin as long as they live in the world; but
   as far as the kingdom of Christ prevails in them, sin is abolished. In
   the meantime they are designated according to the prevailing principle,
   that is, they are said to be righteous and to live righteously, because
   they sincerely aspire to righteousness.

   They are said not to sin, because they consent not to sin, though they
   labor under the infirmity of the flesh; but, on the contrary, they
   struggle with groaning, so that they can truly testify with Paul that
   they do the evil they would not.

   He says that the faithful abide in Christ, because we are by faith
   united to him, and made one with him.

   6 Whosoever sinneth hath not seen him. According to his usual manner he
   added the opposite clause, that we may know that faith in Christ and
   knowledge of him are vainly pretended, except there be newness of life.
   For Christ is never dormant where he reigns, but the Spirit renders
   effectual his power. And it may be rightly said of him, that he puts
   sin to flight, not otherwise than as the sun drives away darkness by
   its own brightness. But we are again taught in this place how strong
   and efficacious is the knowledge of Christ; for it transforms us into
   his image. So by seeing and knowing we are to understand no other thing
   than faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [77] To do, or to commit, or to work, or to practice, sin, and to sin,
   are evidently used in the same sense by the Apostle: and to commit or
   practice sin, according to what he says in his Gospel, (John 8:34,) is
   the same with being "the servant of sin." It is hence evident, that in
   the language of John, to do sin, or to sin, means a prevailing or an
   habitual course of sinning. We might render the fourth verse thus, --
   "Every doer of sin, is also the doer of unrighteousness;
   for sin is unrighteousness," or iniquity, as Calvin renders it. The
   word anomia, literally, is lawlessness, but it is never used strictly
   in this sense either in the Sept or the New Testament. The terms by
   which it is commonly expressed, are, wickedness, iniquity,
   transgression, unrighteousness. See verse 7. -- Ed

   [78] It is generally taken as referring to Christ personally; he being
   mentioned here as having no sin, because he is in this respect an
   example to his people; or, according to some, because he was thereby
   fitted for the office of taking away our sins; or, because he had no
   sin of his own to take away. Grotius viewed the present as used here
   for the past tense, -- "and sin was not in him." See a similar instance
   in John 15:27 -- Ed.

   1 John 3:7-10

   7. Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness
   is righteous, even as he is righteous.

   7. Filioli, nemo vos decipiat; qai facit justitiam justus est,
   quemadmodum ille justus est.

   8. He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from
   the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he
   might destroy the works of the devil.

   8. Qui facit peccatum, ex diabolo est; quia ab initio diabolus peccat:
   in hoc manifestus est Filius Dei, ut solvat opera diaboli.

   9. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth
   in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.

   9. Quisquis natus est ex Deo, peccatum non facit, quoniam semen ejus in
   ipso manet; et non potest peccare, quia ex Deo genitus est.

   10. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the
   devil:

   10. In hoc manifesti sunt filii Dei et filii Diaboli, --


   7. He that doeth righteousness The Apostle shews here that newness of
   life is testified by good works; nor does that likeness of which he has
   spoken, that is between Christ and his members, appear, except by the
   fruits they bring forth; as though he had said, "Since it behooves us
   to be conformed to Christ, the truth and evidence of this must appear
   in our life." The exhortation is the same with that of Paul in
   Galatians

   "If ye live in the Spirit, walk also in the Spirit."
   (Galatians 5:25)

   For many would gladly persuade themselves that they have this
   righteousness buried in their hearts, while iniquity evidently occupies
   their feet, and hands, and tongue, and eyes.

   8 He that committeth sin, This word, to commit, or to do, refers also
   to outward works, so that the meaning is, that there is no life of God
   and of Christ, where men act perversely and wickedly, but that such
   are, on the contrary, the slaves of the devil; and by this way of
   speaking he sets forth more fully how unlike they are to Christ. For as
   he has before represented Christ as the fountain of all righteousness,
   so now, on the other hand, he mentions the devil as the beginning of
   sin. He denied that any one belongs to Christ except he who is
   righteous and shews himself to be such by his works; he now assigns to
   the devil all others, and subjects them to his government, in order
   that we may know that there is no middle condition, but that Satan
   exercises his tyranny where the righteousness of Christ possesses not
   the primacy.

   There are not however two adverse principles, such as the Manicheans
   have imagined; for we know that the devil is not wicked by nature or by
   creation, but became so through defection. We know also that he is not
   equal to God, so that he can with equal right or authority contend with
   him, but that he is unwillingly under restraint, so that he can do
   nothing except at the nod and with the permission of his Creator. John,
   in the last place, in saying that some were born of God and some of the
   devil, imagined no tradition such as the Manicheans dreamt of; but he
   means that the former are governed and guided by the Spirit of God, and
   that the others are led astray by Satan, as God grants to him this
   power over the unbelieving.

   For the Devil sinneth from the beginning As before he spoke not of
   Christ personally, when he said that he is righteous, but mentioned him
   as the fountain and the cause of righteousness; so now, when he says
   that the Devil sins, he includes his whole body, even all the
   reprobate; as though he had said, this belongs to the Devil, to entice
   men to sin. It hence follows, that his members, and all who are ruled
   by him, give themselves up to commit sin. But the beginning which the
   Apostle mentions, is not from eternity, as when he says that the Word
   is from the beginning, for there is a wide difference between God and
   creatures. Beginning as to God, refers to no time. Since, then, the
   Word was always with God, you can find no point of time in which he
   began to be, but you must necessarily admit his eternity. But here John
   meant no other thing than that the Devil had been an apostate since the
   creation of the world, and that from that time he had never ceased to
   scatter his poison among men.

   For this purpose the Son of God was manifested He repeats in other
   words what he had before said, that Christ came to take away sins.
   Hence two conclusions are to be drawn, that those in whom sin reigns
   cannot be reckoned among the members of Christ, and that they can by no
   means belong to his body; for wherever Christ puts forth his own power,
   he puts the Devil to flight as well as sin. And this is what John
   immediately adds; for the next sentence, where he says that those who
   sin not are born of God, is a conclusion from what is gone before. It
   is an argument drawn from what is inconsistent, as I have already said;
   for the kingdom of Christ, which brings righteousness with it, cannot
   admit of sin. But I have already said what not to sin means. He does
   not make the children of God wholly free from all sin; but he denies
   that any can really glory in this distinction, except those who from
   the heart strive to form their life in obedience to God.

   The Pelagians, indeed, and the Catharians did formerly make a wrong use
   of this passage, when they vainly imagined that the faithful are in
   this world endued with angelic purity; and in our own age some of the
   Anabaptists have renewed this dotage. But all those who dream of a
   perfection of this kind, sufficiently shew what stupid consciences they
   must have. But the words of the Apostle are so far from countenancing
   their error, that they are sufficient to confute it.

   He says that they sin not who are born of God. Now, we must consider,
   whether God wholly regenerates us at once, or whether the remains of
   the old man continue in us until death. If regeneration is not as yet
   full and complete, it does not exempt us from the bondage of sin except
   in proportion to its own extent. It hence appears that it cannot be but
   that the children of God are not free from sins, and that they daily
   sin, that is, as far as they have still some remnants of their old
   nature. Nevertheless, what the Apostle contends for stands unalterable,
   that the design of regeneration is to destroy sin, and that all who are
   born of God lead a righteous and a holy life, because the Spirit of God
   restrains the lusting of sin.

   The Apostle means the same thing by the seed of God; for God's Spirit
   so forms the hearts of the godly for holy affections, that the flesh
   and its lusts do not prevail, but being subdued and put as it were
   under a yoke, they are checked and restrained. In short, the Apostle
   ascribes to the Spirit the sovereignty in the elect, who by his power
   represses sin and suffers it not to rule and reign.

   And he cannot sin Here the Apostle ascends higher, for he plainly
   declares that the hearts of the godly are so effectually governed by
   the Spirit of God, that through an inflexible disposition they follow
   his guidance. This is indeed far removed from the doctrine of the
   Papists. The Sorbons, it is true, confess that the will of man, unless
   assisted by God's Spirit, cannot desire what is right; but they imagine
   such a motion of the Spirit as leaves to us the free choice of good and
   evil. Hence they draw forth merits, because we willingly obey the
   influence of the Spirit, which it is in our power to resist. In short,
   they desire the grace of the Spirit to be only this, that we are
   thereby enabled to choose right if we will. John speaks here far
   otherwise; for he not only shews that we cannot sin, but also that the
   power of the Spirit is so effectual, that it necessarily retains us in
   continual obedience to righteousness. Nor is this the only passage of
   Scripture which teaches us that the will is so formed that it cannot be
   otherwise than right. For God testifies that he gives a new heart to
   his children, and promises to do this, that they may walk in his
   commandments. Besides, John not only shews how efficaciously God works
   once in man, but plainly declares that the Spirit continues his grace
   in us to the last, so that inflexible perseverance is added to newness
   of life. Let us not, then, imagine with the Sophists that it is some
   neutral movement, which leaves men free either to follow or to reject;
   but let us know that our own hearts are so ruled by God's Spirit, that
   they constantly cleave to righteousness.

   Moreover; what the Sophists absurdly object, may be easily refuted:
   they say that thus the will is taken away from man; but they say so
   falsely: for the will is a natural power; but, as nature is corrupted,
   it has only depraved inclinations. It is hence necessary that the
   Spirit of God should renew it, in order that it may begin to be good.
   And, then, as men would immediately fall away from what is good, it is
   necessary that the same Spirit should carry on what he has begun, to
   the end.

   As to merit, the answer is obvious, for it cannot be deemed strange
   that men merit nothing; and yet good works, which flow from the grace
   of the Spirit, do not cease to be so deemed, because they are
   voluntary. They have also a reward, for they are by grace ascribed to
   men as though they were their own.

   But here a question arises, Whether the fear and love of God can be
   extinguished in any one who has been regenerated by the Spirit of God?
   for that this cannot be, seems to be the import of the Apostle's words.
   They who think otherwise refer to the example of David, who for a time
   labored under such a beastly stupor, that not a spark of grace appeared
   in him. Moreover, in the fifty-first Psalm, he prays for the
   restoration of the Spirit. It hence follows that he was deprived of
   him. I, however, doubt not but that the seed, communicated when God
   regenerates his elect, as it is incorruptible, retains its virtue
   perpetually. I, indeed, grant that it may sometimes be stifled, as in
   the case of David; but still, when all religion seemed to be extinct in
   him, a live coal was hid under the ashes. Satan, indeed, labors to root
   out whatever is from God in the elect; but when the utmost is permitted
   to him, there ever remains a hidden root, which afterwards springs up.
   But John does not speak of one act, as they say, but of the continued
   course of life.

   Some fanatics dream of something I know not what, that is, of an
   eternal seed in the elect, which they always bring from their mother's
   womb; but for this purpose they very outrageously pervert the words of
   John; for he does not speak of eternal election, but begins with
   regeneration.

   There are also those who are doubly frantic, who hold, under this
   pretense, that, everything is lawful to the faithful, that is, because
   John says that they cannot sin. They then maintain that we may follow
   indiscriminately whatever our inclinations may lead us to. Thus they
   take the liberty to commit adultery, to steal, and to murder, because
   there can be no sin where God's Spirit reigns. But far otherwise is the
   meaning of the Apostle; for he denies that the faithful sin for this
   reason, because God has engraven his law on their hearts, according to
   what the Prophet says (Jeremiah 31:33.)

   10 In this the children of God are manifest. He shortly draws this
   conclusion, that those in vain claim a place and a name among the
   children of God, who do not prove themselves to be such by a pious and
   holy life, since by this evidence they shew that they differ from the
   children of the devil. But he does not mean that they are thus
   manifested, so as to be openly recognized by the whole world; but his
   meaning is only this, that the fruit and adoption always appear in the
   life.

   1 John 3:10-13

   10. -- Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that
   loveth not his brother.

   10. -- Quisquis non facit justitiam, non est ex Deo, et qui non diligit
   fratrem suum.

   11. For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we
   should love one another.

   11. Quia haec est praedicatio quam audistis ab initio, ut mutuo nos
   diligamus.

   12. Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And
   wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his
   brother's righteous.

   12. Non sicut Cain, qui ex maligno erat, occidit fratrem suum; et qua
   de causa eum occidit? Quia opera ejus mala erant, fratris autem justa.

   13. Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

   13. Ne miremini, fratres mei, si vos mundus odit.


   10 Whosoever doeth not righteousness. To do righteousness and to do
   sin, are here set in opposition the one to the other. Then, to do
   righteousness is no other thing than to fear God from the heart, and to
   walk in his commandments as far as human weakness will permit; for
   though righteousness in a strict sense is a perfect keeping of the law,
   from which the faithful are always far off; yet as offenses and
   fallings are not imputed to them by God, righteousness is that
   imperfect obedience which they render to him. But John declares that
   all who do not live righteously are not of God, because all those whom
   God calls, he regenerates by his Spirit. Hence newness of life is a
   perpetual evidence of divine adoption.

   Neither he who loveth not his brother. He accommodates a general
   doctrine to his own purpose. For hitherto he has been exhorting the
   faithful to brotherly love; now, for the same end, he refers to true
   righteousness. Hence this clause is added instead of an explanation.
   But I have already stated the reason why the whole of righteousness is
   included in brotherly love. The love of God holds, indeed, the first
   place; but as on it depends love towards men, it is often, as a part
   for the whole, comprehended under it, and also the latter under the
   former. Then he declares that every one who is endued with benevolence
   and humanity, is thus just, and is to be so deemed, because love is
   rite fulfillment of the law. He confirms this declaration by saying
   that the faithful had been so taught from the beginning; for by these
   words he intimates that the statement which he made ought not to have
   appeared new to them.

   12 Not as Cain This is another confirmation, taken from what is
   contrary; for in the reprobate and the children of the devil hatred
   reigns, and it holds, as it were, the chief place in their life; and he
   brings forward Cain as an instance. It served in the meantime to give
   them consolation, as he at length concluded by saying, Marvel not, if
   the world hate you.

   This explanation ought to be carefully noticed, for men ever blunder as
   to the way of living, because they make holiness to consist of
   fictitious works, and while they torment themselves with trifles, they
   think themselves doubly acceptable to God, as the monks, who proudly
   call their mode of living a state of perfection; nor is there any other
   worship of God under the Papacy but a mass of superstitions. But the
   Apostle testifies that this righteousness alone is approved by God,
   that is, if we love one another; and further, that the devil reigns
   where hatred, dissimulation, envy, and enmity prevail. We ought,
   however, at the same time, to bear in mind what I have already touched
   upon, that brotherly love, as it proceeds from the love of God as an
   effect from a cause, is not disjoined from it, but on the contrary is
   commended by John on this account, because it is an evidence of our
   love to God.

   By saying that Cain was driven to slay his brother, because his works
   were evil, he intimates what I have already stated, that when impiety
   rules, hatred occupies the first place. He refers to Abel's righteous
   works, that we may learn to endure patiently when the world hates us
   gratuitously, without any just provocation.

   1 John 3:15-18

   14. We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love
   the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.

   14. Nos scimus quod transierimus a morte in vitam, quia diligimus
   fratres: qui non diligit fratrem, manet in morte.

   15. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no
   murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

   15. Omnis qui odit fratrem suum, homicida est; et nostis quod omnis
   homicida, non habet vitam aeternam in se manentem.

   16. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life
   for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

   16. In hoc cognoscimus charitatem, quod ille pro nobis animam suam
   posuit: et nos debemus pro fratribus animas ponere.

   17. But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need,
   and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the
   love of God in him?

   17. Si quis habeat victum mundi, et videat fratrem suum egentem, et
   claudat viscera sua ab eo, quomodo charitas Dei in ipso manet?

   18. My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but
   in deed and in truth.

   18. Filioli mei, ne diligamus sermone, neque lingua, sed opere et
   veritate.


   14 We know. He commends love to us by a remarkable eulogy, because it
   is an evidence of a transition from death to life. It hence follows
   that if we love the brethren we are blessed, but that we are miserable
   if we hate them. There is no one who does not wish to be freed and
   delivered from death. Those then who by cherishing hatred willingly
   give themselves up to death, must be extremely stupid and senseless.
   But when the Apostle says, that it is known by love that we have passed
   into life, he does not mean that man is his own deliverer, as though he
   could by loving the brethren rescue himself from death, and procure
   life for himself; for he does not here treat of the cause of salvation,
   but as love is the special fruit of the Spirit, it is also a sure
   symbol of regeneration. Then the Apostle draws an argument from the
   sign, and not from the cause. For as no one sincerely loves his
   brethren, except he is regenerated by the Spirit of God, he hence
   rightly concludes that the Spirit of God, who is life, dwells in all
   who love the brethren. But it would be preposterous for any one to
   infer hence, that life is obtained by love, since love is in order of
   time posterior to it.

   The argument would be more plausible, were it said that love makes us
   more certain of life: then confidence as to salvation would recumb on
   works. But the answer to this is obvious; for though faith is confirmed
   by all the graces of God as aids, yet it ceases not to have its
   foundation in the mercy of God only. As for instance, when we enjoy the
   light, we are certain that the sun shines; if the sun shines on the
   place in which we are, we have a clearer view of it; but yet when the
   visible rays do not come to us, we are satisfied that the sun diffuses
   its brightness for our benefit. So when faith is founded on Christ,
   some things may happen to assist it, still it rests on Christ's grace
   alone.

   15 Is a murderer To stimulate us still more to love, he shews how
   detestable before God is hatred. There is no one who dreads not a
   murderer; nay, we all execrate the very name. But the Apostle declares
   that all who hate their brethren are murderers. He could have said
   nothing more atrocious; nor is what is said hyperbolical, for we wish
   him to perish whom we hate. It does not matter if a man keeps his hands
   from mischief; for the very desire to do harm, as well as the attempt,
   is condemned before God: nay, when we do not ourselves seek to do an
   injury, yet if we wish an evil to happen to our brother from some one
   else, we are murderers.

   Then the Apostle defines the thing simply as it is, when he ascribes
   murder to hatred. Hence is proved the folly of men, that though they
   abominate the name, they yet make no account of the crime itself.
   Whence is this? even because the external face of things engrosses our
   thoughts; but the inward feeling comes to an account before God. Let no
   one therefore extenuate any more so grievous an evil. Let us learn to
   refer our judgments to the tribunal of God.

   16 Hereby perceive we, or, By this we know. He now shews what true love
   is; for it would not have been enough to commend it, unless its power
   is understood. As an instance of perfect love, he sets before us the
   example of Christ; for he, by not sparing his own life, testified how
   much he loved us. This then is the mark to which he bids them to
   advance. The sum of what is said is, that our love is approved, when we
   transfer the love of ourselves to our brethren, so that every one, in a
   manner forgetting himself, should seek the good of others. [79]

   It is, indeed, certain, that we are far from being equal to Christ: but
   the Apostle recommends to us the imitation of him; for though we do not
   overtake him, it is yet meet, that we should follow his steps, though
   at a distance. Doubtless, since it was the Apostle's object to beat
   down the vain boasting of hypocrites, who gloried that they had faith
   in Christ though without brotherly love, he intimated by these words,
   that except this feeling prevails in our hearts, we have no connection
   with Christ. Nor does he yet, as I have said, set before us the love of
   Christ, so as to require us to be equal to him; for what would this be
   but to drive us all to despair? But he means that our feelings should
   be so formed and regulated, that we may desire to devote our life and
   also our death, first to God, and then to our neighbors.

   There is another difference between us and Christ, -- the virtue or
   benefit of our death cannot be the same. For the wrath of God is not
   pacified by our blood, nor is life procured by our death, nor is
   punishment due to others suffered by us. But the Apostle, in this
   comparison, had not in view the end or the effect of Christ's death;
   but he meant only that our life should be formed according to his
   example.

   17 But whose hath this world's good, or, If any one has the world's
   sustenance. He now speaks of the common duties of love, which flow from
   that chief foundation, that is, when we are prepared to serve our
   neighbors even to death. He, at the same time, seems to reason from the
   greater to the less; for he who refuses to alleviate by his goods the
   want of his brother, while his life is safe and secure, much less would
   he expose for him his life to danger. Then he denies that there is love
   in us, if we withhold help from our neighbors. But he so recommends
   this external kindness, that at the same time he very fitly expresses
   the right way of doing good, and what sort of feeling ought to be in
   us.

   Let this, then, be the first proposition, that no one truly loves his
   brethren, except he really shews this whenever an occasion occurs; the
   second, that as far as any one has the means, he is bound so far to
   assist his brethren, for the Lord thus supplies us with the opportunity
   to exercise love; the third, that the necessity of every one ought to
   be seen to, for as any one needs food and drink or other things of
   which we have abundance, so he requires our aid; the fourth, that no
   act of kindness, except accompanied with sympathy, is pleasing to God.
   There are many apparently liberal, who yet do not feel for the miseries
   of their brethren. But the Apostle requires that our bowels should be
   opened; which is done, when we are endued with such a feeling as to
   sympathize with others in their evils, no otherwise than as though they
   were our own.

   The love of God Here he speaks of loving the brethren; why then does he
   mention the love of God? even because this principle is to be held,
   that it cannot be but that the love of God will generate in us the love
   of the brethren. [80] And thus God tries our love to him, when he bids
   us to love men from a regard to himself, according to what is said in
   Psalm 16:2,

   "My goodness reaches not to thee, but towards the saints who are on the
   earth is my will and my care."

   18. Let us not love in word There is a concession in this first clause;
   for we cannot love in tongue only; but as many falsely pretend this,
   the Apostle concedes, according to what is often done, the name of the
   thing to their dissimulation, though, in the second clause, he reproves
   their vanity, when he denies that there is reality except in the deed.
   For thus ought the words to be explained, -- Let us not profess by the
   tongue that we love, but prove it by the deed; for this is the only
   true way of shewing love. [81]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [79] There is no authority for adding of God after love in this verse;
   nor indeed is it right, for what follows clearly shows that the love of
   Christ is what is referred to. The antecedent to "he," ("because he
   laid down," &e.) is "the Son of God" in the 8th verse. The passage may
   be thus rendered, "By this we know love, that he laid down his own life
   for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for our brethren." -- Ed.

   [80] "The love of God" here is love of which God is the object, that
   is, love to God. -- Ed.

   [81] Beza and others regard "only," or "merely," as understood in the
   first clause, according to a mode of speaking which often occurs in
   Scripture, as "Labor not," etc., (John 6:27.) "My dear children, let us
   love, not only by word, or with the tongue, but by work and in truth."
   That is, let us not love only by making in words fair promises, or by
   expressing sympathy with the tongue, but by giving effect to our
   sympathy by works, and by making our word true, by fulfilling it. Here
   we find the same arrangement as in many other instances; the "word" has
   its correspondence in "truth;" and "tongue in "work." It is justly
   observed by Macknight, that "the Apostle cannot be supposed to forbid
   our using affectionate speeches to our brethren in distress But he
   forbiddeth us to content ourselves with these." -- Ed

   1 John 3:19-22

   19. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our
   hearts before him.

   19. Et in hoc cognoscimus quod ex veritate sumus, et coram ipso
   persuadebimus corda nostra.

   20. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and
   knoweth all things.

   20. Quod si accuset nos cor nostrum, certe major est Deus corde nostro
   et novit omnia.

   21. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
   toward God.

   21. Dilecti, si cor nostrum non accuset, fiduciam habemus erga Deum:

   22. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
   commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

   22. Et siquid petierimus, accipimus ab eo, quia praecepta ejus
   servamus, et quæ coram co placent facimus.


   19 And hereby we know, or, by this we know. The word truth, he takes
   now in a different sense; but there is a striking similarity in the
   words, -- If we, in truth, love our neighbors, we have an evidence that
   we are born of God, who is truth, or that the truth of God dwells in
   us. But we must ever remember, that we have not from love the knowledge
   which the Apostle mentions, as though we were to seek from it the
   certainty of salvation. And doubtless we know not otherwise that we are
   the children of God, than as he seals his free adoption on our hearts
   by his own Spirit., and as we receive by faith the sure pledge of it
   offered in Christ. Then love is accessory or an inferior aid, a prop to
   our faith, not a foundation on which it rests.

   Why then does the Apostle say, We shall assure our hearts before God?
   He reminds us by these words, that faith does not exist without a good
   conscience; not that assurance arises from it or depends on it, but
   that then only we are really and not falsely assured of our union with
   God, when by the efficacy of his Holy Spirit he manifests himself in
   our love. For it is ever meet and proper to consider what the Apostle
   handles; for as he condemns feigned and false profession of faith, he
   says that a genuine assurance before God we cannot have, except his
   Spirit produces in us the fruit of love. Nevertheless, though a good
   conscience cannot be separated from faith, yet no one should hence
   conclude that we must look to our works in order that our assurance may
   be certain.

   20. For if our heart condemn us He proves, on the other hand, that they
   in vain possess the name and appearance of Christians, who have not the
   testimony of a good conscience. For if any one is conscious of guilt,
   and is condemned by his own heart, much less can he escape the judgment
   of God. It hence follows, that faith is subverted by the disquiet of an
   evil conscience.

   He says, that God is greater than our heart, with reference to
   judgment, that is, because he sees much more keenly than we do, and
   searches more minutely and judges more severely. For this reason, Paul
   says, that though he was not conscious of wrong himself, yet he was not
   therefore justified, (1 Corinthians 4:4;) for he knew that however
   carefully attentive he was to his office, he erred in many things, and
   through inadvertence was ignorant of mistakes which God perceived. What
   then the Apostle means is, that he who is harassed and condemned by his
   own conscience, cannot escape the judgment of God.

   To the same purpose is what immediately follows, that God knoweth or
   seeth all things For how can those things be hid from him which we, who
   in comparison with him are dull and blind, are constrained to see? Then
   take this explanation, "Since God sees all things, he is far superior
   to our hearts." For to render a copulative as a causal particle is no
   new thing. The meaning is now clear, that since the knowledge of God
   penetrates deeper than the perceptions of our conscience, no one can
   stand before him except the integrity of his conscience sustains him.

   But here a question may be raised. It is certain that the reprobate are
   sometimes sunk by Satan into such stupor, that they are no longer
   conscious of their own evils, and. without alarm or fear, as Paul says,
   rush headlong into perdition; it is also certain, that hypocrites
   usually flatter themselves, and proudly disregard the judgment of God,
   for, being inebriated by a false conceit as to their own righteousness,
   they feel no convictions of sin. The answer to these things is not
   difficult; hypocrites are deceived because they shun the light; and the
   reprobate feel nothing, because they have departed from God; and,
   indeed there is no security for an evil conscience but in
   hiding-places.

   But the Apostle speaks here of consciences which God draws forth to the
   light, forces to his tribunal, and fills with an apprehension of his
   judgment. Yet; it is at the same time generally true, that we cannot
   have a calm peace except that which God's Spirit gives to purified
   hearts; for those who, as we have said, are stupefied, often feel
   secret compunctions, and torment themselves in their lethargy.

   21 If our heart condemns not I have already explained that this refers
   not to hypocrites nor to the gross despisers of God. For how muchsoever
   the reprobate may approve of their own lives, yet the Lord, as Solomon
   says, weigheth their hearts. (Proverbs 16:2.) This balance of God, by
   which he tries men, is such, that no one can boast that he has a clean
   heart. The meaning, then, of the Apostle's words is, that then only we
   come in calm confidence into God's presence, when we bring with us the
   testimony of a heart conscious of what is right and honest. That saying
   of Paul is indeed true, that by faith, which relies on the grace of
   Christ, an access to God with confidence is opened to us, (Ephesians
   3:12;) and also, that peace is given us by faith, that our consciences
   may stand peaceably before God. (Romans 5:1.) But there is not much
   difference between these sentences; for Paul shews the cause of
   confidence, but John mentions only an inseparable addition, which
   necessarily adheres to it, though it be not the cause.

   Here, however, arises a greater difficulty, which seems to leave no
   confidence in the whole world; for who can be found whose heart
   reproves him in nothing? To this I answer, that the godly are thus
   reproved, that they may at the same time be absolved. For it is indeed
   necessary that they should be seriously troubled inwardly for their
   sins, that terror may lead them to humility and to a hatred of
   themselves; but they presently flee to the sacrifice of Christ, where
   they have sure peace. Yet the Apostle says, in another sense, that they
   are not condemned, because however deficient they may confess
   themselves to be in many things, they are still relieved by this
   testimony of conscience, that they truly and from the heart fear God
   and desire to submit to his righteousness. All who possess this godly
   feeling, and at the same time know that all their endeavors, how
   muchsoever they come short of perfection, yet please God, are justly
   said to have a calm or a peaceful heart, because there is no inward
   compunction to disturb their calm cheerfulness.

   22 And whatsoever we ask These two things are connected, confidence and
   prayer. As before he shewed that an evil conscience is inconsistent
   with confidence, so now he declares that none can really pray to God
   but those who with a pure heart, fear and rightly worship him. The
   latter follows from the former. It is a general truth taught in
   Scripture, that the ungodly are not heard by God, but that on the
   contrary, their sacrifices and prayers are an abomination to him. Hence
   the door is here closed up against hypocrites, lest they should in
   contempt of him rush into his presence.

   He does not yet mean that a good conscience must be brought, as though
   it obtained favor to our prayers. Woe to us if we look on works, which
   have nothing in them but what is a cause of fear and trembling. The
   faithful, then, cannot otherwise come to God's tribunal than by relying
   on Christ the Mediator. But as the love of God is ever connected with
   faith, the Apostle, in order that he might the more severely reprove
   hypocrites, deprives them of that singular privilege with which God
   favors his own children; that is, lest they should think that their
   prayers have an access to God.

   By saying, because we keep his commandments, he means not that
   confidence in prayer is founded on our works; but he teaches this only,
   that true religion and the sincere worship of God cannot be separated
   from faith. Nor ought it to appear strange that he uses a causal
   particle, though he does not speak of a cause; for an inseparable
   addition is sometimes mentioned as a cause as when one says, Because
   the sun shines over us at midday, there is more heat; but it does not
   follow that heat comes from light.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 John 3:23-24

   23. And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of
   his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.

   23. Et hoc est praeceptum ejus, ut eredamns riomini Filii ejus Jesu
   Christi, et nos diligamus invicem, sicuti praeceptum dedit nobis.

   24. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in
   him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he
   hath given us.

   24. Qui servat praecepta ejus, in ipso manet, et ipse in eo; atque in
   hoc cognoscimus quod manet in nobis, ex Spiritu quem nobis dedit.


   23 And this is his commandment He again accommodates a general truth to
   his own purpose. The meaning is, that such is the discord between us
   and God, that we are kept off from an access to him, except we are
   united by love to one another. At the same time he does not here
   commend love alone, as before, but joins it as the companion and
   attendant of faith.

   The Sophists by their glosses distort these words, as though liberty to
   pray were obtained by us, partly by faith and partly by works. As John
   requires us to keep God's commandments that we may pray aright, and
   afterwards teaches us that this keeping refers to faith and love, they
   conclude, that from these two things ought we to derive confidence in
   prayer. But I have already several times reminded you, that the subject
   here is not how or by what means men may prepare themselves so that
   they may have confidence to pray to God, for he speaks not here of the
   cause of ills or of any worthiness. John only shews, that God favors
   none with the honor and privilege of intercourse with himself but his
   own children, even those who have been regenerated by his Spirit. The
   import, then, of what is said is, Where the fear and love of God do not
   prevail, it cannot be that God will hear prayer.

   But if it be our purpose to obey his commandments, let us see what he
   commands. He does not, however, separate faith from love; but he
   requires both together from us. And this is the reason why he uses the
   word commandment in the singular number.

   But this is a remarkable passage; for he defines briefly as well as
   lucidly in what the whole perfection of a holy life consists. There is
   then no reason that we should allege any difficulty, since God does by
   no means lead us about through long labyrinths, but simply and shortly
   sets before us what is right and what he approves. Besides, in this
   brevity there is no obscurity, for he shews to us clearly the beginning
   and the end of a life rightly formed. But that a mention is here only
   made of brotherly love, while the love of God is omitted, the reason
   is, as we have elsewhere said, that as brotherly love flows from the
   love of God, so it is a sure and real evidence of it.

   On the name of his Son The name refers to preaching; and this
   connection deserves to be noticed, for few understand what it is to
   believe on Christ; but from this mode of speaking, we may easily
   conclude that the only right faith is that which embraces Christ as he
   is set forth in the Gospel. Hence also it is, that there is no faith
   without teaching, as Paul also shews to us in Romans 10:14. We must at
   the same time observe, that the Apostle includes faith in the knowledge
   of Christ; for he is the living image of the Father, and in him are
   laid up all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. As soon, then, as we
   turn aside from him, we cannot do anything else but wander in error.

   24 And he that keepeth his commandments He confirms what I have already
   stated, that the union we have with God is evident when we entertain
   mutual love: not that our union begins thereby, but that it cannot be
   fruitless or without effect whenever it begins to exist. And he proves
   this by adding a reason, because God does not abide in us, except his
   Spirit dwells in us. But wherever the Spirit is, he necessarily
   manifests his power and efficiency. We hence readily conclude, that
   none abide in God and are united to him, but those who keep his
   commandments.

   When, therefore, he says, and by this we know, the copulative, and, as
   a reason is here given, is to be rendered, "for," or, "because." But
   the character of the present reason ought to be considered; for though
   the sentence in words agrees with that of Paul, when he says that the
   Spirit testifies to our hearts that we are the children of God, and
   that we through him cry to God, Abba, Father, yet there is some
   difference in the sense; for Paul speaks of the certainty of gratuitous
   adoption, which the Spirit of God seals on our hearts; but John here
   regards the effects which the Spirit produces while dwelling in us, as
   Paul himself does, when he says, that those are God's children who are
   led by the Spirit of God; for there also he is speaking of the
   mortification of the flesh and newness of life.

   The sum of what is said is, that it hence appears that we are God's
   children, that is, when his Spirit rules and governs our life. John at
   the same time teaches us, that whatever good works are done by us,
   proceed from the grace of the Spirit, and that the Spirit is not
   obtained by our righteousness, but is freely given to us.

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 John 4:1-3

   1. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they
   are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

   1. Dilecti, ne omni spiritui credatis, sed probate spiritus, an ex Deo
   sint; quia multi pseudoprophetae exierunt in mundum.

   2. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that
   Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:

   2. In hoc cognoscite Spiritum Dei; omnis spiritus qui confitetur Jesum
   Christum in carne venisse, ex Deo est:

   3. And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in
   the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof
   ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the
   world.

   3. Et omnis spiritus qui non confitetur Jesum Christum in carne
   venisse, ex Deo non est; et hic est antichristus, de quo audiistis quod
   venturus sit; et nunc jam in mundo est.


   He returns to his former doctrine, which he had touched upon in the
   second chapter; for many (as it is usual in new things) abused the name
   of Christ for the purpose of serving their own errors. Some made a half
   profession of Christ; and when they obtained a place among his friends,
   they had more opportunity to injure his cause. Satan took occasion to
   disturb the Church, especially through Christ himself; for he is the
   stone of offense, against whom all necessarily stumble who keep not on
   the right way, as shewn to us by God.

   But what the Apostle says consists of three parts. He first shews an
   evil dangerous to the faithful; and therefore he exhorts them to
   beware. He prescribes how they were to beware, that is, by making a
   distinction between the spirits; and this is the second part. In the
   third place, he points out a particular error, the most dangerous to
   them, he therefore forbids them to hear those who denied that the Son
   of God appeared in the flesh. We shall now consider each in order.

   But though in the passage this reason is added, that many false
   prophets had gone forth into the world, yet it is convenient to begin
   with it. The announcement contains a useful admonition; for if Satan
   had then already seduced many, who under the name of Christ scattered
   their impostures, similar instances at this day ought not to terrify
   us. For it is the case perpetually with the Gospel, that Satan attempts
   to pollute and corrupt its purity by variety of errors. This our age
   has brought forth some horrible and monstrous sects; and for this
   reason many stand amazed; and not knowing where to turn, they cast
   aside every care for religion; for they find no more summary way for
   extricating themselves from the danger of errors. They thus, indeed,
   act most foolishly; for by shunning the light of truth, they cast
   themselves into the darkness of errors. Let, therefore, this fact
   remain fixed in our minds, that from the time the Gospel began to be
   preached, false prophets immediately appeared; and the fact will
   fortify us against such offenses.

   The antiquity of errors keeps many, as it were, fast bound, so that
   they dare not emerge from them. But John points out here all intestine
   evil which was then in the Church. Now, if there were impostors mixed
   then with the Apostles and other faithful teachers, what wonder is it,
   that the doctrine of the Gospel has been long ago suppressed, and that
   many corruptions have prevailed in the world? There is, then, no reason
   why antiquity should hinder us to exercise our liberty in
   distinguishing between truth and falsehood.

   1 Believe not every spirit When the Church is disturbed by discords and
   contentions, many, as it has been said, being frightened, depart from
   the Gospel. But the Spirit prescribes to us a far different remedy,
   that is, that the faithful should not receive any doctrine
   thoughtlessly and without discrimination. We ought, then, to take heed
   lest, being offended at the variety of opinions, we should discard
   teachers, and, together with them, the word of God. But this precaution
   is sufficient, that all are not to be heard indiscriminately.

   The word spirit I take metonymically, as signifying him who boasts that
   he is endowed with the gift of the Spirit to perform his office as a
   prophet. For as it was not permitted to any one to speak in his own
   name, nor was credit given to speakers but as far as they were the
   organs of the Holy Spirit, in order that prophets might have more
   authority, God honored them with this name, as though he had separated
   them from mankind in general. Those, then, were called spirits, who,
   giving only a language to the oracles of the Holy Spirit, in a manner
   represented him. They brought nothing of their own, nor came they forth
   in their own name, but the design of this honorable title was, that
   God's word should not lose the respect due to it through the humble
   condition of the minister. For God would have his word to be always
   received from the mouth of man no otherwise than if he himself had
   appeared from heaven.

   Here Satan interposed, and having sent false teachers to adulterate
   God's word, he gave them also this name, that they might more easily
   deceive. Thus false prophets have always been wont superciliously and
   boldly to claim for themselves whatever honor God had bestowed on his
   own servants. But the Apostle designedly made use of this name, lest
   they who falsely pretend God's name should deceive us by their masks,
   as we see at this day; for many are so dazzled by the mere name of a
   Church, that they prefer, to their eternal ruin, to cleave to the Pope,
   than to deny him the least part of his authority.

   We ought, therefore, to notice this concession: for the Apostle might
   have said that every sort of men ought not to be believed; but as false
   teachers claimed the Spirit, so he left them to do so, having at the
   same time reminded them that their claim was frivolous and nugatory,
   except they really exhibited what they professed, and that those were
   foolish who, being astonished at the very sound of so honorable a name,
   dared not to make any inquiry on the subject.

   Try the spirits As all were not true prophets, the Apostle here
   declares that they ought to have been examined and tried. And he
   addresses not only the whole Church, but also every one of the
   faithful.

   But it may be asked, whence have we this discernment? They who answer,
   that the word of God is the rule by which everything that men bring
   forward ought to be tried, say something, but not the whole. I grant
   that doctrines ought to be tested by God's word; but except the Spirit
   of wisdom be present, to have God's word in our hands will avail little
   or nothing, for its meaning will not appear to us; as, for instance,
   gold is tried by fire or touchstone, but it can only be done by those
   who understand the art; for neither the touchstone nor the fire can be
   of any use to the unskillful. That we may then be fit judges, we must
   necessarily be endowed with and directed by the Spirit of discernment.
   But as the Apostle would have commanded this in vain, were there no
   power of judging supplied, we may with certainty conclude, that the
   godly shall never be left destitute of the Spirit of wisdom as to what
   is necessary, provided they ask for him of the Lord. But the Spirit
   will only thus guide us to a right discrimination, when we render all
   our thoughts subject to God's word; for it is, as it has been said,
   like the touchstone, yea, it ought to be deemed most necessary to us;
   for that alone is true doctrine which is drawn from it.

   But here a difficult question arises: If every one has the right and
   the liberty to judge, nothing can be settled as certain, but on the
   contrary the whole of religion will be uncertain. To this I answer,
   that there is a twofold trial of doctrine, private and public. The
   private trial is that by which every one settles his own faith, when he
   wholly acquiesces in that doctrine which he knows has come from God;
   for consciences will never find a safe and tranquil port otherwise than
   in God. Public trial refers to the common consent and polity of the
   Church; for as there is danger lest fanatics should rise up, who may
   presumptuously boast that they are endued with the Spirit of God, it is
   a necessary remedy, that the faithful meet together and seek a way by
   which they may agree in a holy and godly manner. But as the old proverb
   is too true, "So many heads, so many opinions," it is doubtless a
   singular work of God, when he subdues our perverseness and makes us to
   think the same thing, and to agree in a holy unity of faith.

   But what Papists under this pretense hold, that whatever has been
   decreed in councils is to be deemed as certain oracles, because the
   Church has once proved them to be from God, is extremely frivolous. For
   though it be the ordinary way of seeking consent, to gather a godly and
   holy council, when controversies may be determined according to God's
   word; yet God has never bound himself to the decrees of any council.
   Nor does it necessarily follow, that as soon as a hundred bishops or
   more meet together in any place, they have duly called on God and
   inquired at his mouth what is true; nay, nothing is more clear that
   they have often departed from the pure word of God. Then in this case
   also the trial which the Apostle prescribes ought to take place, so
   that the spirits may be proved.

   2 Hereby, or by this, know ye He lays down a special mark by which they
   might more easily distinguish between true and false prophets. Yet he
   only repeats here what we have met with before, that as Christ is the
   object at which faith aims, so he is the stone at which all heretics
   stumble. As long then as we abide in Christ, there is safety; but when
   we depart from him, faith is lost, and all truth is rendered void. [82]

   But let us consider what this confession includes; for when the Apostle
   says that Christ came, we hence conclude that he was before with the
   Father; by which his eternal divinity is proved. By saying that he came
   in the flesh, he means that by putting on flesh, he became a real man,
   of the same nature with us, that he might become our brother, except
   that he was free from every sin and corruption. And lastly, by saying
   that he came, the cause of his coming must be noticed, for he was not
   sent by the Father for nothing. Hence on this depend the office and
   merits of Christ.

   As, then, the ancient heretics departed from the faith, in one
   instance, by denying the divine, and in another by denying the human
   nature of Christ; so do the Papists at this day: though they confess
   Christ to be God and man, yet they by no means retain the confession
   which the Apostle requires, because they rob Christ of his own merit;
   for where freewill, merits of works, fictitious modes of worship,
   satisfactions, the advocacy of saints, are set up, how very little
   remains for Christ!

   The Apostle then meant this, that since the knowledge of Christ
   includes the sum and substance of the doctrine respecting true
   religion, our eyes ought to be directed to and fixed on that, so that
   we may not be deceived. And doubtless Christ is the end of the law and
   the prophets; nor do we learn anything else from the gospel but his
   power and grace.

   3. And this is that spirit of Antichrist The Apostle added this, to
   render more detestable the impostures which lead us away from Christ.
   We have already said that the doctrine respecting the kingdom of
   Antichrist was well known; so that the faithful had been warned as to
   the future scattering of the Church, in order that they might exercise
   vigilance. Justly then did they dread the name as something base and
   ominous. The Apostle says now, that all those who depreciated Christ
   were members of that kingdom.

   And he says that the spirit of antichrist would come, and that it was
   already in the world, but in a different sense. He means that it was
   already in the world, because it carried on in secret its iniquity. As,
   however, the truth of God had not as yet been subverted by false and
   spurious dogmas, as superstition had not as yet prevailed in corrupting
   the worship of God, as the world had not as yet perfidiously departed
   from Christ, as tyranny, opposed to the kingdom of Christ, had not as
   yet openly exalted itself, he therefore says, that it would come.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [82] It appears that by "spirit" throughout this passage, we are to
   understand a teacher claiming, rightly or falsely, to be influenced by
   God's Spirit. Nor would it be improper, but suitable to the context, to
   consider the spirit of God in this verse as meaning a teacher guided by
   God. The meaning of the passage might be thus expressed, -- 2. "By this
   know ye the teacher of God; every teacher who confesses Jesus Christ as
   having come in the flesh, is from God; and 3. every teacher who does
   not confess Jesus Christ as having come in the flesh, is not from God;
   and this is the teacher of Antichrist, (or, the Anti Christian
   teacher,) of whom ye have heard that he is coming, and he is now
   already in the world." -- Ed

   1 John 4:4-6

   4. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because
   greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

   4. Vos ex Deo estis, filioli, et vicistis eos; quia major est qui est
   in vobis, quam qui in mundo.

   5. They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the
   world heareth them.

   5. Ipsi ex mundo sunt; propterea ex mundo loquuntur, et mundus eos
   audit.

   6. We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God
   heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of
   error.

   6. Nos ex Deo sumus; qui novit Deum, audit nos; qui non est ex Deo, non
   audit nos: in hoc cognocimus spiritum veritatis et spiritum erroris.


   4 Ye are of God He had spoken of one antichrist; he now mentions many.
   But the many were the false prophets who had come forth before the head
   appeared. [83] But the Apostle's object was to animate the faithful,
   that they might courageously and boldly resist impostors, for alacrity
   is weakened when the issue of the contest is doubtful. Besides, it
   might have caused the good to fear, when they saw that hardly the
   kingdom of Christ had been set up, when enemies stood ready to suppress
   it. Though then they must contend, yet he says that they had conquered,
   because they would have a successful issue, as though he had said that
   they were already, though in the middle of the contest;, beyond any
   danger, because they would surely be conquerors.

   But this truth ought to be farther extended, for whatever contests we
   may have with the world and the flesh, a certain victory is to follow.
   Hard and fierce conflicts indeed await us, and some continually succeed
   others; but as by Christ's power we fight and are furnished with God's
   weapons, we even by fighting and striving become conquerors. As to the
   main subject of this passage, it is a great consolation, that with
   whatever wiles Satan may assail us, we shall stand through the power of
   God.

   But we must observe the reason which is immediately added, because
   greater, or stronger, is he who is in you than he who is in the world.
   For such is our infirmity, that we succumb before we engage with an
   enemy, for we are so immersed in ignorance that we are open to all
   kinds of fallacies, and Satan is wonderfully artful in deceiving. Were
   we to hold out for one day, yet a doubt may creep into our minds as to
   what would be the case tomorrow; we should thus be in a state of
   perpetual anxiety. Therefore the Apostle reminds us that we become
   strong, not by our own power, but by that of God. He hence concludes,
   that we can no more be conquered than God himself, who has armed us
   with his own power to the end of the world. But in this whole spiritual
   warfare this thought ought to dwell in our hearts, that it would be all
   over with us immediately were we to fight in our own strength; but that
   as God repels our enemies while we are reposing, victory is certain.
   [84]

   5 They are of the world It is no small consolation that they who dare
   to assail God in us, have only the world to aid and help them. And by
   the world the Apostle means that portion of which Satan is the prince.
   Another consolation is also added, when he says that the world embraces
   through the false prophets that which it acknowledges as its own. [85]
   We see what great propensity to vanity and falsehood there is in men.
   Hence false doctrines easily penetrate and spread far and wide. The
   Apostle intimates that there is no reason why we should on this account
   be disturbed, for it is nothing new or unusual that the world, which is
   wholly fallacious, should readily hearken to what is false.

   6 We are of God Though this really applies to all the godly, yet it
   refers properly to the faithful ministers of the Gospel; for the
   Apostle, through the confidence imparted by the Spirit, glories here
   that he and his fellow-ministers served God in sincerity, and derived
   from him whatever they taught. It happens that false prophets boast of
   the same thing, for it is their custom to deceive under the mask of
   God; but faithful ministers differ much from them, who declare nothing
   of themselves but what they really manifest in their conduct.

   We ought, however, always to bear in mind the subject which he here
   handles; small was the number of the godly, and unbelief prevailed
   almost everywhere; few really adhered to the Gospel, the greater part
   were running headlong into errors. Hence was the occasion of stumbling.
   John, in order to obviate this, bids us to be content with the fewness
   of the faithful, because all God's children honored him and submitted
   to his doctrine. For he immediately sets in opposition to this a
   contrary clause, that they who are not of God, do not hear the pure
   doctrine of the Gospel. By these words he intimates that the vast
   multitude to whom the Gospel is not acceptable, do not hear the
   faithful and true servants of God, because they are alienated from God
   himself. It is then no diminution to the authority of the Gospel that
   many reject it.

   But to this doctrine is added a useful admonition, that by the
   obedience of faith we are to prove ourselves to be of God. Nothing is
   easier than to boast that we are of God; and hence nothing is more
   common among men, as the case is at this day with the Papists, who
   proudly vaunt that they are the worshippers of God, and yet they no
   less proudly reject the word of God. For though they pretend to believe
   God's word, yet when they are brought to the test, they close their
   ears and will not hear, and yet to revere God's word is the only true
   evidence that we fear him. Nor can the excuse, made by many, have any
   place here, that they shun the doctrine of the Gospel when proclaimed
   to them, because they are not fit to form a judgment; for it cannot be
   but that every one who really fears and obeys God, knows him in his
   word.

   Were any one to object and say, that many of the elect do not
   immediately attain faith, nay, that at first they stubbornly resist; to
   this I answer, that at that time they are not to be regarded, as I
   think, as God's children; for it is a sign of a reprobate man when the
   truth is perversely rejected by him.

   And by the way, it must be observed, that the hearing mentioned by the
   Apostle, is to be understood of the inward and real hearing of the
   heart, which is done by faith.

   Hereby know we The antecedent to hereby, or, by this, is included in
   the two preceding clauses, as though he had said, "Hence the truth is
   distinguished from falsehood, because some speak from God, others from
   the world." But by the spirit of truth and the spirit of error, some
   think that hearers are meant, as though he had said, that those who
   give themselves up to be deceived by impostors, were born to error, and
   had in them the seed of falsehood; but that they who obey the word of
   God shew themselves by this very fact to be the children of the truth.
   This view I do not approve of. For as the Apostle takes spirits here
   metonymically for teachers or prophets, he means, I think, no other
   thing than that the trial of doctrine must be referred to these two
   things, whether it be from God or from the world. [86]

   However, by thus speaking he seems to say nothing; for all are ready to
   declare, that they do not speak except from God. So the Papists at this
   day boast with magisterial gravity, that all their inventions are the
   oracles of the Spirit. Nor does Mahomet assert that he has drawn his
   dotages except from heaven. The Egyptians also, in former times,
   pretended that all their mad absurdities, by which they infatuated
   themselves and others, had been revealed from above. But, to all this I
   reply, that we have the word of the Lord, which ought especially to be
   consulted. When, therefore, false spirits pretend the name of God, we
   must inquire from the Scriptures whether things are so. Provided a
   devout attention be exercised, accompanied with humility and meekness,
   the spirit of discernment will be given us, who, as a faithful
   interpreter, will open to us the meaning of what is said in Scripture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [83] When it is said, ye "have overcome them," the antecedent to "them"
   is no doubt "the false prophets" in the first verse. It is usual with
   John to refer to antecedents at some distance. See John 3:16. -- Ed.

   [84] "The world" is in this verse identified with "the false prophets;"
   true Christians had overcome these for this reason, because greater was
   he that was in them than he that was in the world, that is, in the
   unbelieving and ungodly, of whom the false prophets formed a part.
   Hence it follows, "They are of the world," that is, they are of the
   number of those who are ungodly and wicked, who make up the kingdom of
   darkness. -- Ed.

   [85] The clause, "therefore speak they of the world," is hardly a true
   rendering, for ek never means "of," in the sense of "concerning."
   Macknight renders it "from." Grotius paraphrases the sentence thus,
   "They preach things agreeable to the dispositions of the world;" and
   Doddridge thus, "They speak as of the world, as taking their
   instructions from it." But ek, like ex in Latin, means sometimes
   "according to," as in Matthew 12:37, "For by (or, according to) thy
   words thou shalt be justified." See also verse 34, "but of (or,
   according to) the abundance," etc. Then this sentence may be thus
   rendered, "Therefore speak they according to the world:" that is,
   according to the views and principles of the superstitious and ungodly
   men of the world. -- Ed

   [86] According to this view, "the spirit of truth" means the teacher of
   truth, and "the spirit of error" the teacher of error; and this is
   agreeable to the whole tenor of the context, the spirit throughout
   denoting the person who claimed, rightly or falsely, to be under the
   direction of the divine Spirit. "By this," refers to what had been just
   stated, that is, that false teachers were of the world, and spake
   things agreeable to the worldly-minded, and were heard by the world,
   and that the true teachers were from God, and were heard or attended to
   by those who knew God, and were not attended to by such as were
   ignorant of him. It was by this statement which he had made, they could
   distinguish between the teacher of truth and the teacher of error. The
   teacher of truth was one from God, and was attended to by those who
   knew God, and not by those who knew him not; on the other hand, the
   teacher of error was from the world, preached what was agreeable to the
   men of the world, and was hearkened to by them. The order, as it is
   often the case, is inverted; the teacher of error, mentioned last, is
   described in the fifth verse, and the teacher of truth, mentioned
   first, at the beginning of the sixth. -- Ed.

   1 John 4:7-10

   7. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
   that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

   7. Dilecti, diligamus nos mutuo, quia dilectio ex Deo est; et omnis qui
   diligit ex Deo genitus est, et cognoscit Deum.

   8. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

   8. Qui non diligit, non novit Deum; quia Deus dilectio est.

   9. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
   sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through
   him.

   9. In hoc apparuit dilectio Dei in nobis, quod Filium suum unigenitum
   misit Deus in mundum, ut per eum vivamus.

   10. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
   sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

   10. In hoc est dilectio, non quod nos dilexerimus Deum, sed quod nos
   ipse dilexit, et misit Filium propitiationem pro peccatis nostris.


   7 Beloved He returns to that exhortation which he enforces almost
   throughout the Epistle. We have, indeed, said, that it is filled with
   the doctrine of faith and exhortation to love. On these two points he
   so dwells, that he continually passes from the one to the other.

   When he commands mutual love, he does not mean that we discharge this
   duty when we love our friends, because they love us; but as he
   addresses in common the faithful, he could not have spoken otherwise
   than that they were to exercise mutual love. He confirms this sentence
   by a reason often adduced before, even because no one can prove himself
   to be the son of God, except he loves his neighbors, and because the
   true knowledge of God necessarily produces love in us.

   He also sets in opposition to this, according to his usual manner, the
   contrary clause, that there is no knowledge of God where there is no
   love. And he takes as granted a general principle or truth, that God is
   love, that is, that his nature is to love men. I know that many reason
   more refinedly, and that the ancients especially have perverted this
   passage in order to prove the divinity of the Spirit. But the meaning
   of the Apostle is simply this, -- that as God is the fountain of love,
   this effect flows from him, and is diffused wherever the knowledge of
   him comes, as he had at the beginning called him light, because there
   is nothing dark in him, but on the contrary he illuminates all things
   by his own brightness. Here then he does not speak of the essence of
   God, but only shews what he is found to be by us.

   But two things in the Apostle's words ought to be noticed, -- that the
   true knowledge of God is that which regenerates and renews us, so that
   we become new creatures; and that hence it cannot be but that it must
   conform us to the image of God. Away, then, with that foolish gloss
   respecting unformed faith. For when any one separates faith from love,
   it is the same as though he attempted to take away heat from the sun.

   9 In this was manifested, or, has appeared. We have the love of God
   towards us testified also by many other proofs. For if it be asked, why
   the world has been created, why we have been placed in it to possess
   the dominion of the earth, why we are preserved in life to enjoy
   innumerable blessings, why we are endued with light and understanding,
   no other reason can be adduced, except the gratuitous love of God. But
   the Apostle here has chosen the principal evidence of it, and what far
   surpasses all other things. For it was not only an immeasurable love,
   that God spared not his own Son, that by his death he might restore us
   to life; but it was goodness the most marvelous, which ought to fill
   our minds with the greatest wonder and amazement. Christ, then, is so
   illustrious and singular a proof of divine love towards us, that
   whenever we look upon him, he fully confirms to us the truth that God
   is love.

   He calls him his only begotten, for the sake of amplifying. For in this
   he more clearly shewed how singularly he loved us, because he exposed
   his only Son to death for our sakes. In the meantime, he who is his
   only Son by nature, makes many sons by grace and adoption, even all
   who, by faith, are united to his body. He expresses the end for which
   Christ has been sent by the Father, even that we may live through him,
   for without him we are all dead, but by his coming he brought life to
   us; and except our unbelief prevents the effect of his grace, we feel
   it in ourselves.

   10 Herein is love He amplifies God's love by another reason, that he
   gave us his own Son at the time when we were enemies, as Paul teaches
   us, in Romans 5:8; but he employs other words, that God, induced by no
   love of men, freely loved them. He meant by these words to teach us
   that God's love towards us has been gratuitous. And though it was the
   Apostle's object to set forth God as an example to be imitated by us;
   yet the doctrine of faith which he intermingles, ought not to be
   overlooked. God freely loved us, -- how so? because he loved us before
   we were born, and also when, through depravity of nature, we had hearts
   turned away from him, and influenced by no right and pious feelings.

   Were the prattlings of the Papists entertained, that every one is
   chosen by God as he foresees him to be worthy of love, this doctrine,
   that he first loved us, would not stand; for then our love to God would
   be first in order, though in time posterior. But the Apostle assumes
   this as an evident truth, taught in Scripture (of which these profane
   Sophists are ignorant,) that we are born so corrupt and depraved, that
   there is in us as it were an innate hatred to God, so that we desire
   nothing but what is displeasing to him, so that all the passions of our
   flesh carry on continual war with his righteousness.

   And sent his Son It was then from God's goodness alone, as from a
   fountain, that Christ with all his blessings has come to us. And as it
   is necessary to know, that we have salvation in Christ, because our
   heavenly Father has freely loved us; so when a real and full certainty
   of divine love towards us is sought for, we must look nowhere else but
   to Christ. Hence all who inquire, apart from Christ, what is settled
   respecting them in God's secret counsel, are mad to their own ruin.

   But he again points out the cause of Christ's coming and his office,
   when he says that he was sent to be a propitiation for our sins And
   first, indeed, we are taught by these words, that we were all through
   sin alienated from God, and that this alienation and discord remains
   until Christ intervenes to reconcile us. We are taught, secondly, that
   it is the beginning of our life, when God, having been pacified by the
   death of his Son, receives us unto favor: for propitiation properly
   refers to the sacrifice of his death. We find, then, that this honor of
   expiating for the sins of the world, and of thus taking away the enmity
   between God and us, belongs only to Christ.

   But here some appearance of inconsistency arises. For if God loved us
   before Christ offered himself to death for us, what need was there for
   another reconciliation? Thus the death of Christ may seem to be
   superfluous. To this I answer, that when Christ is said to have
   reconciled the Father to us, this is to be referred to our
   apprehensions; for as we are conscious of being guilty, we cannot
   conceive of God otherwise than as of one displeased and angry with us,
   until Christ absolves us from guilt. For God, wherever sin appears,
   would have his wrath, and the judgment of eternal death, to be
   apprehended. It hence follows, that we cannot be otherwise than
   terrified by the present prospect. as to death, until Christ by his
   death abolishes sin, until he delivers us by his own blood from death.
   Further, God's love requires righteousness; that we may then be
   persuaded that we are loved, we must necessarily come to Christ, in
   whom alone righteousness is to be found.

   We now see that the variety of expressions, which occurs in Scripture,
   according to different aspects of things, is most appropriate and
   especially useful with regard to faith. God interposed his own Son to
   reconcile himself to us, because he loved us; but this love was hid,
   because we were in the meantime enemies to God, continually provoking
   his wrath. Besides, the fear and terror of an evil conscience took away
   from us all enjoyment of life. Thence as to the apprehension of our
   faith, God began to love us in Christ. And though the Apostle here
   speaks of the first reconciliation, let us yet know that to propitiate
   God to us by expiating sins is a perpetual benefit proceeding from
   Christ.

   This the Papists also in part concede; but afterwards they extenuate
   and almost annihilate this grace, by introducing their fictitious
   satisfactions. For if men redeem themselves by their works, Christ
   cannot be the only true propitiation, as he is called here.

   1 John 4:11-16

   11. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

   11. Dilecti, si ita Deus nos dilexit, nos quoque debemus invicem
   diligere.

   12. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
   dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

   12. Deum nemo vidit unquam; si diligimus nos invicem, Deus in nobis
   manet, et dilectio ejus perfecta est in nobis.

   13. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath
   given us of his Spirit.

   13. In hoc cognoscimus, quod in ipso manemus, et ipse in nobis, quit ex
   Spiritu suo dedit nobis.

   14. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be
   the Saviour of the world.

   14. Et nos vidimus et testamur, testify, quod Pater misit Filium
   servatorem mundi.

   15. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth
   in him, and he in God.

   15. Qui confessus fuerit, quod Jesus est Filius Dei, Deus in eo manet
   et ipse in Deo.

   16. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is
   love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

   16. Et nos cognovimus et credimus dilectionem quam habet Deus in nobis:
   Deus charitas est; et qui manet in charitate, in Deo manet, et Deus in
   eo.


   11 Beloved Now the Almighty accommodates to his own purpose what he has
   just taught us respecting the love of God; for he exhorts us by God's
   example to brotherly love; as also Paul sets before us Christ, who
   offered himself to the Father a sacrifice of pleasant fragrance, that
   every one of us might labor to benefit his neighbors. (Ephesians 5:2.)
   And John reminds us, that our love ought not to be mercenary, when he
   bids us to love our neighbors as God has loved us; for we ought to
   remember this, that we have been loved freely. And doubtless when we
   regard our own advantage, or return good offices to friends, it is
   self-love, and not love to others.

   12 No man hath seen God The same words are found in the first chapter
   of John's Gospel; but John the Baptist had not there exactly the same
   thing in view, for he meant only that God could not be otherwise known,
   but as he has revealed himself in Christ. The Apostle here extends the
   same truth farther, that the power of God is comprehended by us by
   faith and love, so as to know that we are his children and that he
   dwells in us.

   He speaks, however, first of love, when he says, that God dwells in us,
   if we love one another; for perfected, or really proved to be, in us is
   then his love; as though he had said, that God shews himself as
   present, when by his Spirit he forms our hearts so that they entertain
   brotherly love. For the same purpose he repeats what he had already
   said, that we know by the Spirit whom he has given us that he dwells in
   us; for it is a confirmation of the former sentence, because love is
   the effect or fruit of the Spirit.

   The sum, then, of what is said is, that since love is from the Spirit
   of God, we cannot truly and with a sincere heart love the brethren,
   except the Spirit puts forth his power. In this way he testifies that
   he dwells in us. But God by his Spirit dwells in us; then, by love we
   prove that we have God abiding in us. On the other hand, whosoever
   boasts that he has God and loves not the brethren, his falsehood is
   proved by this one thing, because he separates God from himself.

   When he says, and his love is perfected, the conjunction is to be taken
   as a causative, for, or, because And love here may be explained in two
   ways, either that which God shews to us, or that which he implants in
   us. That God has given his Spirit to us, or given us of his Spirit,
   means the same thing; for we know that the Spirit in a measure is given
   to each individual.

   14 And we have seen He now explains the other part of the knowledge of
   God, which we have referred to, that he communicates himself to us in
   his Son, and offers himself to be enjoyed in him. It hence follows,
   that he is by faith received by us. For the design of the Apostle is to
   shew, that God is so united to us by faith and love, that he really
   dwells in us and renders himself in a manner visible by the effect of
   his power, who otherwise could not be seen by us.

   When the Apostle says, We have, seen and do testify, he refers to
   himself and others. And by seeing, he does not mean any sort of seeing,
   but what belongs to faith by which they recognized the glory of God in
   Christ, according to what follows, that he was sent to be the Savior of
   the world; and this knowledge flows from the illumination of the
   Spirit.

   15 Whosoever shall confess He repeats the truth, that we are united to
   God by Christ, and that we cannot be connected with Christ except, God
   abides in us. Faith and confession are used indiscriminately in the
   same sense; for though hypocrites may wisely boast of faith, yet the
   apostle here acknowledges none of those who ordinarily confess, but
   such as truly and from the heart believe. Besides, when he says that
   Jesus is the Son of God, he briefly includes the sum and substance of
   faith; for there is nothing necessary for salvation which faith finds
   not in Christ

   After having said in general, that men are so united to Christ by
   faith, that Christ unites them to God, he subjoined what they
   themselves had seen so that he accommodated a general truth to those to
   whom he was writing. Then follows the exhortation, to love one another
   as they were loved by God. Therefore the order and connection of his
   discourse is this, -- Faith in Christ, makes God to dwell in men, and
   we are partakers of this grace; but as God is love, no one dwells in
   him except he loves his brethren. Then love ought to reign in us, since
   God unites himself to us.

   16 And we have known and believed It is the same as though he had said,
   "We have known by believing;" for such knowledge is not attained but by
   faith. But we hence learn how different, is an uncertain or doubtful
   opinion from faith. Besides, though he meant here, as I have already
   said, to accommodate the last sentence to his readers, yet he defines
   faith in various ways. He had said before, that it is to confess that
   Jesus is the Son of God; but, he now says, We know by faith God's love
   towards us. It hence appears, that the paternal love of God is found in
   Christ, and that nothing certain is known of Christ, except by those
   who know themselves to be the children of God by his grace. For the
   Father sets his own Son daily before us for this end, that he may adopt
   us in him.

   God is love This is as it were the minor proposition in an argument;
   for from faith to love he reasons in this way: By faith God dwells in
   us, and God is love; then, wherever God abides, love ought to be there.
   Hence it follows that love is necessarily connected with faith.

   1 John 4:17-18

   17. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the
   day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.

   17. In hoc perfecta est charitas nobiscum, ut fiduciam habaemus in die
   judicii, quod sicut ille est, nos quoque sumus in hoc mundo.

   18. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
   because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.

   18. Timor non est in charitate; sed perfecta charitas foras pellit
   timorem: quia timor tormentum habet; qui autem timet, non est perfectus
   in charitate.


   17 Herein is our love made perfect There are two clauses in this
   passage, -- that we are then partakers of divine adoption, when we
   resemble God as children their father; and, secondly, that this
   confidence is invaluable, for without it we must be most miserable.

   Then in the first place, he shews to what purpose God has in love
   embraced us, and how we enjoy that grace manifested to us in Christ.
   Then, God's love to us is what is to be understood here. He says it is
   perfected, because it is abundantly poured forth and really given, that
   it appears to be complete. But he asserts that no others are partakers
   of this blessing; but those who, by being conformed to God, prove
   themselves to be his children. It is, then, an argument taken from what
   is an inseparable condition.

   That we may have boldness He now begins to shew the fruit of divine
   love towards us, though he afterwards shews it more clearly from the
   contrary effect. It is, however, an invaluable benefit, that we can
   dare boldly to stand before God. By nature, indeed, we dread the
   presence of God, and that justly; for, as he is the Judge of the world,
   and our sins hold us guilty, death and hell must come to our minds
   whenever we think of God. Hence is that dread which I have mentioned,
   which makes men shun God as much as they can. But John says that the
   faithful do not fear, when mention is made to them of the last
   judgment, but that on the contrary they go to God's tribunal
   confidently and cheerfully, because they are assured of his paternal
   love. Every one, then, has made so much proficiency in faith, as he is
   well prepared in his mind to look forward to the day of judgment.

   As he is By these words, as it has been already said, he meant that it
   is required of us at our turn to resemble the image of God. What God
   then in heaven is, such he bids us to be in this world, in order that
   we may be deemed his children; for the image of God, when it appears in
   us, is as it were the seal of his adoption.

   But he seems thus to place a part of our confidence on works. Hence the
   Papists raise their crests here, as though John denied that we, relying
   on God's grace alone, can have a sure confidence as to salvation
   without the help of works. But in this they are deceived, because they
   do not consider that the Apostle here does not refer to the cause of
   salvation, but to what is added to it. And we readily allow that no one
   is reconciled to God through Christ, except he is also renewed after
   God's image, and that the one cannot be disjoined from the other. Right
   then is what is done by the Apostle, who excludes from the confidence
   of grace all those in whom no image of God is seen; for it is certain
   that such are wholly aliens to the Spirit of God and to Christ. Nor do
   we deny that newness of life, as it is the effect of divine adoption,
   serves to confirm confidence, as a prop, so to speak, of the second
   order; but in the meantime we ought to have our foundation on grace
   alone. [87] Nor indeed does the doctrine of John appear otherwise
   consistent with itself; for experience proves, and even Papists are
   forced to confess, that as to works they always give an occasion for
   trembling. Therefore no one can come with a tranquil mind to God's
   tribunal, except he believes that he is freely loved.

   But that none of these things please the Papists, there is no reason
   for any one to wonder, since being miserable they know no faith except
   that which is entangled with doubts. Besides, hypocrisy brings darkness
   over them, so that they do not seriously consider how formidable is
   God's judgment when Christ the Mediator is not present, and some of
   them regard the resurrection as fabulous. But that we may cheerfully
   and joyfully go forth to meet Christ, we must have our faith fixed on
   his grace alone.

   18 There is no fear He now commends the excellency of this blessing by
   stating the contrary effect, for he says that we are continually
   tormented until God delivers us from misery and anguish by the remedy
   of his own love towards us. The meaning is, that as there is nothing
   more miserable than to be harassed by continual inquietude, we obtain
   by knowing God's love towards us the benefit of a peaceful calmness
   beyond the reach of fear. It hence appears what a singular gift of God
   it is to be favored with his love. Moreover from this doctrine, he will
   presently draw an exhortation; but before he exhorts us to duty, he
   commends to us this gift of God, which by faith removes our fear.

   This passage, I know, is explained otherwise by many; but I regard what
   the Apostle means, not what others think. They say that there is no
   fear in love, because, when we voluntarily love God, we are not
   constrained by force and fear to serve him. Then according to them,
   servile fear is here set in opposition to voluntary reverence; and
   hence has arisen the distinction between servile and filial fear. I
   indeed allow it to be true, that when we willingly love God as a
   Father, we are no longer constrained by the fear of punishment; but
   this doctrine has nothing in common with this passage, for the Apostle
   only teaches us, that when the love of God is by us seen and known by
   faith, peace is given to our consciences, so that they no longer
   tremble and fear.

   It may, however, be asked, when does perfect love expel fear, for since
   we are endued with some taste only of divine love towards us, we can
   never be wholly freed from fear? To this I answer, that, though fear is
   not wholly shaken off, yet when we flee to God as to a quiet harbor,
   safe and free from all danger of shipwreck and of tempests, fear is
   really expelled, for it gives way to faith. Then fear is not so
   expelled, but that it assails our minds, but it is so expelled that it
   does not torment us nor impede that peace which we obtain by faith.

   Fear hath torment Here the Apostle amplifies still further the
   greatness of that grace of which he speaks; for as it is a most
   miserable condition to suffer continual torments, there is nothing more
   to be wished than to present ourselves before God with a quiet
   conscience and a calm mind. What some say, that servants fear, because
   they have before their eyes punishment and the rod, and that they do
   not their duty except when forced, has nothing to do, as it has been
   already stated, with what the Apostle says here. So in the next clause,
   the exposition given, that he who fears is not perfect in love, because
   he submits not willingly to God, but would rather free himself from his
   service, does not comport at all with the context. For the Apostle, on
   the contrary, reminds us, that it is owing to unbelief when any one
   fears, that is, has a disturbed mind; for the love of God, really
   known, tranquilizes the heart. [88]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [87] What is love? It is as much a gift, a grace, as faith; it
   constitutes a fitness for heaven, but is in no way meritorious; and
   were it perfect, there would be nothing of merit in it; for the highest
   degrees of it come far short of what is due to God. To set up merit of
   any kind on the part of man, betokens extreme blindness, for salvation
   from first to last is altogether gratuitous. -- Ed

   [88] Beza, Doddridge, Scott, and most commentators, regard love here as
   that which is in us, and not the love of God as apprehended by faith.
   The main subject of the Apostle is love in us, and the words
   "perfected" and "perfect," as applied to it, seem inappropriate to
   God's love towards us; and this perfection is said in verse 17th to
   consist in this, that as God is, so are we in this world; that is, like
   him in love, as God is said in the previous verse to be love. "Fear" is
   the fear of judgment, mentioned in verse 17th, and he who fears is said
   to be not perfected or made perfect in love, which obviously refers to
   love in us. And then it immediately follows, "We love him," and the
   reason is assigned, "because he first loved us." He afterwards proceeds
   to show the indispensable necessity of having love to God and to the
   brethren -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 John 4:19-21

   19. We love him, because he first loved us.

   19. Nos diligimus eum, quia prior dilexit nos.

   20. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for
   he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God
   whom he hath not seen?

   20. Si quis dicit, Deum diligo; et proximum suum odio habeat, mendax
   est: qui enim non diligit fratrem suum quem videt; Deum quem non videt,
   quomodo potest diligere?

   21. And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love
   his brother also.

   21. Et hoc præceptum habemus ab ipso, ut qui Deum diligit, diligat et
   fratrem suum.


   19 We love him The verb agapomen may be either in the indicative or
   imperative mood; but the former is the more suitable here, for the
   Apostle, as I think, repeats the preceding sentence, that as God has
   anticipated us by his free love, we ought to return to render love to
   him, for he immediately infers that he ought to be loved in men, or
   that the love we have for him ought to be manifested towards men. If,
   however, the imperative mood be preferred, the meaning would be nearly
   the same, that as God has freely loved us, we also ought now to love
   him.

   But this love cannot exist, except it generates brotherly love. Hence
   he says, that they are liars who boast that they love God, when they
   hate their brethren.

   But the reason he subjoins seems not sufficiently valid, for it is a
   comparison between the less and the greater: If, he says, we love not
   our brethren whom we see, much less can we love God who is invisible.
   Now there are obviously two exceptions; for the love which God has to
   us is from faith and does not flow from sight, as we find in 1 Peter
   1:8; and secondly, far different is the love of God from the love of
   men; for while God leads his people to love him through his infinite
   goodness, men are often worthy of hatred. To this I answer, that the
   Apostle takes here as granted what ought no doubt to appear evident to
   us, that God offers himself to us in those men who bear his image, and
   that he requires the duties, which he does not want himself, to be
   performed to them, according to Psalm 16:2, where we read,

   "My goodness reaches not to thee, O Lord;
   towards the saints who are on the earth is my love."

   And surely the participation of the same nature, the need of so many
   things, and mutual intercourse, must allure us to mutual love, except;
   we are harder than iron. But John meant another thing: he meant to shew
   how fallacious is the boast of every one who says that he loves God,
   and yet loves not God's image which is before his eyes.

   21 And this commandment This is a stronger argument, drawn from the
   authority and doctrine of Christ; for he not only gave a commandment
   respecting the love of God, but bade us also to love our brethren. We
   must therefore so begin with God, as that there may be at the same time
   a transition made to men.

   CHAPTER 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 John 5:1-5

   1. Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
   everyone that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten
   of him.

   1. Omnis qui credit quod Jesus est Christus, ex Deo genitus est; et
   omnis qui diligit eum qui genuit, diligit etiam eum qui genitus est ab
   eo.

   2. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God,
   and keep his commandments.

   2. In hoc cognoscimus quod diligimus filios Dei, si Deum diligimus, et
   praecepta ejus servamus.

   3. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his
   commandments are not grievous.

   3. Haec est dilectio Dei, ut praecepta ejus servemus, et praecepta ejus
   gravia non sunt.

   4. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the
   victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

   4. Quoniam omne qued ex Deo genitum est, vincit mundum: et haec est
   victoria quae vincit mundum, fides nostra.

   5. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that
   Jesus is the Son of God?

   5. Quis est qui vincit mundum, nisi qui credit quod Jesus est Filius
   Dei?


   1 Whosoever believeth He confirms by another reason, that faith and
   brotherly love are united; for since God regenerates us by faith he
   must necessarily be loved by us as a Father; and this love embraces all
   his children. Then faith cannot be separated from love.

   The first truth is, that all born of God, believe that Jesus is the
   Christ; where, again, you see that Christ alone is set forth as the
   object of faith, as in him it finds righteousness, life, and every
   blessing that can be desired, and God in all that he is. [89] Hence the
   only true way of believing is when we direct our minds to him. Besides,
   to believe that he is the Christ, is to hope from him all those things
   which have been promised as to the Messiah.

   Nor is the title, Christ, given him here without reason, for it
   designates the office to which he was appointed by the Father. As,
   under the Law, the full restoration of all things, righteousness and
   happiness, were promised through the Messiah; so at this day the whole
   of this is more clearly set forth in the gospel. Then Jesus cannot be
   received as Christ, except salvation be sought from him, since for this
   end he was sent by the Father, and is daily offered to us.

   Hence the Apostle declares that all they who really believe have been
   born of God; for faith is far above the reach of the human mind, so
   that we must be drawn to Christ by our heavenly Father; for not any of
   us can ascend to him by his own strength. And this is what the Apostle
   teaches us in his Gospel, when he says, that those who believe in the
   name of the only-begotten, were not born of blood nor of the flesh.
   (John 1:13.) And Paul says, that we are endued, not with the spirit of
   this world, but with the Spirit that is from God, that we may know the
   things given us by him. (1 Corinthians 2:12.) For eye hath not seen,
   nor ear heard, nor the mind conceived, the reward laid up for those who
   love God; but the Spirit alone penetrates into this mystery. And
   further, as Christ is given to us for sanctification, and brings with
   it the Spirit of regeneration, in short, as he unites us to his own
   body, it is also another reason why no one can have faith, except he is
   born of God.

   Loveth him also that is begotten of him Augustine and some others of
   the ancients have applied this to Christ, but not correctly. For though
   the Apostle uses the singular number, yet he includes all the faithful;
   and the context plainly shows that his purpose was no other than to
   trace up brotherly love to faith as its fountain. It is, indeed, an
   argument drawn from the common course of nature; but what is seen among
   men is transferred to God. [90]

   But we must observe, that the Apostle does not so speak of the faithful
   only, and pass by those who are without, as though the former are alone
   to be loved, and no care and no account to be had for the latter; but
   he teaches us as it were by this first exercise to love all without
   exception, when he bids us to make a beginning with the godly. [91]

   2 By this we know He briefly shows in these words what true love is,
   even that which is towards God. He has hitherto taught us that there is
   never a true love to God, except when our brethren are also loved; for
   this is ever its effect. But he now teaches us that men are rightly and
   duly loved, when God holds the primacy. And it is a necessary
   definition; for it often happens, that we love men apart from God, as
   unholy and carnal friendships regard only private advantages or some
   other vanishing objects. As, then, he had referred first to the effect,
   so he now refers to the cause; for his purpose is to shew that mutual
   love ought to be in such a way cultivated that God may be honored.

   To the love of God he joins the keeping of the law, and justly so; for
   when we love God as our Father and Lord, reverence must necessarily be
   connected with love. Besides, God cannot be separated from himself. As,
   then, he is the fountain of all righteousness and equity, he who loves
   him must necessarily have his heart prepared to render obedience to
   righteousness. The love of God, then, is not idle or inactive. [92]

   But from this passage we also learn what is the keeping of the law. For
   if, when constrained only by fear, we obey God by keeping his
   commandments, we are very far off from true obedience. Then, the first
   thing is, that our hearts should be devoted to God in willing
   reverence, and then, that our life should be formed according to the
   rule of the law. This is what Moses meant when, in giving a summary of
   the law, he said,

   "O Israel, what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to love him
   and to obey him?" (Deuteronomy 10:12.)

   3 His commandments are not grievous This has been added, lest
   difficulties, as it is usually the case, should damp or lessen our
   zeal. For they who with a cheerful mind and great ardor have pursued a
   godly and holy life, afterwards grow weary, finding their strength
   inadequate. Therefore John, in order to rouse our efforts, says that
   God's commandments are not grievous.

   But it may, on the other hand, be objected and said that we have found
   it far otherwise by experience, and that Scripture testifies that the
   yoke of the law is insupportable. (Acts 15:2.) The reason also is
   evident, for as the denial of self is, as it were, a prelude to the
   keeping of the law, can we say that it is easy for a man to deny
   himself? nay, since the law is spiritual, as Paul, in Romans 7:14,
   teaches us, and we are nothing but flesh, there must be a great discord
   between us and the law of God. To this I answer, that this difficulty
   does not arise from the nature of the law, but from our corrupt flesh;
   and this is what Paul expressly declares; for after having said that it
   was impossible for the Law to confer righteousness on us, he
   immediately throws the blame on our flesh.

   This explanation fully reconciles what is said by Paul and by David,
   which apparently seems wholly contradictory. Paul makes the law the
   master of death, declares that it effects nothing but to bring on us
   the wrath of God, that it was given to increase sin, that it lives in
   order to kill us. David, on the other hand, says that it is sweeter
   than honey, and more desirable than gold; and among other
   recommendations he mentions the following -- that it cheers hearts,
   converts to the Lord, and quickens. But Paul compares the law with the
   corrupt nature of man; hence arises the conflict: but David shews how
   they think and feel whom God by his Spirit has renewed; hence the
   sweetness and delight of which the flesh knows nothing. And John has
   not omitted this difference; for he confines to God's children these
   words, God's commandments are not grievous, lest any one should take
   them literally; and he intimates that, it comes through the power of
   the Spirit, that it is not grievous nor wearisome to us to obey God.

   The question, however, seems not as yet to be fully answered; for the
   faithful, though ruled by the Spirit, of God, yet, carry on a hard
   contest with their own flesh; and how muchsoever they may toil, they
   yet hardly perform the half of their duty; nay, they almost fail under
   their burden, as though they stood, as they say, between the sanctuary
   and the steep. We see how Paul groaned as one held captive, and
   exclaimed that he was wretched, because he could not fully serve God.
   My reply to this is, that the law is said to be easy, as far as we are
   endued with heavenly power, and overcome the lusts of the flesh. For
   however the flesh may resist, yet the faithful find that there is no
   real enjoyment except in following God.

   It must further be observed, that John does not speak of the law only,
   which contains nothing but commands, but connects with it the paternal
   indulgence of God, by which the rigor of the law is mitigated. As,
   then, we know that we are graciously forgiven by the Lord, when our
   works do not come up to the law, this renders us far more prompt to
   obey, according to what we find in Psalm 130:4,

   "With thee is propitiation, that thou mayest be feared."

   Hence, then, is the facility of keeping the law, because the faithful,
   being sustained by pardon, do not despond when they come short of what
   they ought to be. The Apostle, in the meantime, reminds us that we must
   fight, in order that we may serve the Lord; for the whole world hinders
   us to go where the Lord calls us. Then, he only keeps the law who
   courageously resists the world.

   4 This is the victory As he had said that all who are born of God
   overcome the world, he also sets forth the way of overcoming it. For it
   might be still asked, whence comes this victory? He then makes the
   victory over the world to depend on faith. [93]

   This passage is remarkable, for though Satan continually repeats his
   dreadful and horrible onsets, yet the Spirit of God, declaring that we
   are beyond the reach of danger, removes fear, and animates us to fight
   with courage. And the past time is more emphatical than the present or
   the future; for he says, that has overcome, in order that we might feel
   certain, as though the enemy had been already put to flight. It is,
   indeed, true, that our warfare continues through life, that our
   conflicts are daily, nay, that new and various battles are every moment
   on every side stirred up against us by the enemy; but as God does not
   arm us only for one day, and as faith is not that of one day, but is
   the perpetual work of the Holy Spirit, we are already partakers of
   victory, as though we had already conquered.

   This confidence does not, however, introduce indifference, but renders
   us always anxiously intent on fighting. For the Lord thus bids his
   people to be certain, while yet he would not have them to be secure;
   but on the contrary, he declares that they have already overcome, in
   order that they may fight more courageously and more strenuously.

   The term world has here a wide meaning, for it includes whatever is
   adverse to the Spirit of God: thus, the corruption of our nature is a
   part of the world; all lusts, all the crafts of Satan, in short,
   whatever leads us away from God. Having such a force to contend with,
   we have an immense war to carry on, and we should have been already
   conquered before coming to the contest, and we should be conquered a
   hundred times daily, had not God promised to us the victory. But God
   encourages us to fight by promising us the victory. But as this promise
   secures to us perpetually the invincible power of God, so, on the other
   hand, it annihilates all the strength of men. For the Apostle does not
   teach us here that God only brings some help to us, so that being aided
   by him, we may be sufficiently able to resist; but he makes victory to
   depend on faith alone; and faith receives from another that by which it
   overcomes. They then take away from God what is his own, who sing
   triumph to their own power.

   5 Who is he that overcometh the world This is a reason for the previous
   sentence; that is, we conquer by faith, because we derive strength from
   Christ; as Paul also says,

   "I can do all things through him that strengtheneth me,"
   (Philippians 4:13.)

   He only then can conquer Satan and the world, and not succumb to his
   own flesh, who, diffident as to himself, recumbs on Christ's power
   alone. For by faith he means a real apprehension of Christ, or an
   effectual laying hold on him, by which we apply his power to ourselves.

   1 John 5:6-9

   6. This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by
   water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth
   witness, because the Spirit is truth.

   6. Hic est qui venit per aquam et sanguinem, Jesum Christum; non in
   aqua solum, sed in aqua et sanguine; et Spiritus est qui testificatur,
   quandoquidem Spiritus est veritas.

   7. For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the
   Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

   7. Nam tres sunt qui testificantur in coelo, Pater, Sermo, et Spiritus
   Sanctus; et hi tres unum sunt.

   8. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the
   water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

   8. Et tres sunt qui testificantur in terra, Spiritus, aqua et sanguis;
   et hi tres in unum conveniunt.

   9. If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for
   this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.

   9. Si testimonium hominum recipimus, testimonium Dei majus est; quoniam
   hoc est testimonium Dei, quod testificatus est de Filio suo.


   6 This is he that came That our faith may rest safely on Christ, he
   says the real substance of the shadows of the law appears in him. For I
   doubt not but that he alludes by the words water and blood to the
   ancient rites of the law. The comparison, moreover, is intended for
   this end, not only that we may know that the Law of Moses was abolished
   by the coming of Christ, but that we may seek in him the fulfillment of
   those things which the ceremonies formerly typified. And though they
   were of various kinds, yet under these two the Apostle denotes the
   whole perfection of holiness and righteousness, for by water was all
   filth washed away, so that men might come before God pure and clean,
   and by blood was expiation made, and a pledge given of a full
   reconciliation with God; but the law only adumbrated by external
   symbols what was to be really and fully performed by the Messiah.

   John then fitly proves that Jesus is the Christ of the Lord formerly
   promised, because he brought with him that by which he sanctifies us
   wholly.

   And, indeed, as to the blood by which Christ reconciled God, there is
   no doubt, but how he came by water may be questioned. But that the
   reference is to baptism is not probable. I certainly think that John
   sets forth here the fruit and effect of what he recorded in the Gospel
   history; for what he says there, that water and blood flowed from the
   side of Christ, is no doubt to be deemed a miracle. I know that such a
   thing does happen naturally to the dead; but it happened through God's
   purpose, that Christ's side became the fountain of blood and water, in
   order that the faithful may know that cleansing (of which the ancient
   baptisms were types) is found in him, and that they might know that
   what all the sprinklings of blood formerly presignified was fulfilled.
   On this subject we dwelt more at large on the [8]ninth and [9]tenth
   chapters of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

   And it is the Spirit that beareth witness He shews in this clause how
   the faithful know and feel the power of Christ, even because the Spirit
   renders them certain; and that their faith might not vacillate, he
   adds, that a full and real firmness or stability is produced by the
   testimony of the Spirit. And he calls the Spirit truth, because his
   authority is indubitable, and ought to be abundantly sufficient for us.

   7. There are three than bear record in heaven The whole of this verse
   has been by some omitted. Jerome thinks that this has happened through
   design rather than through mistake, and that indeed only on the part of
   the Latins. But as even the Greek copies do not agree, I dare not
   assert any thing on the subject. Since, however, the passage flows
   better when this clause is added, and as I see that it is found in the
   best and most approved copies, I am inclined to receive it as the true
   reading. [94] And the meaning would be, that God, in order to confirm
   most abundantly our faith in Christ, testifies in three ways that we
   ought to acquiesce in him. For as our faith acknowledges three persons
   in the one divine essence, so it is called in so really ways to Christ
   that it may rest on him.

   When he says, These three are one, he refers not to essence, but on the
   contrary to consent; as though he had said that the Father and his
   eternal Word and Spirit harmoniously testify the same thing respecting
   Christ. Hence some copies have eis hen, "for one." But though you read
   hen eisin, as in other copies, yet there is no doubt but that the
   Father, the Word and the Spirit are said to be one, in the same sense
   in which afterwards the blood and the water and the Spirit are said to
   agree in one.

   But as the Spirit, who is one witness, is mentioned twice, it seems to
   be an unnecessary repetition. To this I reply, that since he testifies
   of Christ in various ways, a twofold testimony is fitly ascribed to
   him. For the Father, together with his eternal Wisdom and Spirit,
   declares Jesus to be the Christ as it were authoritatively, then, in
   this ease, the sole majesty of the deity is to be considered by us. But
   as the Spirit, dwelling in our hearts, is an earnest, a pledge, and a
   seal, to confirm that decree, so he thus again speaks on earth by his
   grace.

   But inasmuch as all do not receive this reading, I will therefore so
   expound what follows, as though the Apostle referred to the witnesses
   only on the earth.

   8 There are three He applies what had been said of water and blood to
   it's own purpose, in order that they who reject Christ might have no
   excuse; for by testimonies abundantly strong and clear, he proves that
   it is he who had been formerly promised, inasmuch as water and blood,
   being the pledges and the effects of salvation, really testify that he
   had been sent by God. He adds a third witness, the Holy Spirit, who yet
   holds the first place, for without him the water and blood would have
   flowed without any benefit; for it is he who seals on our hearts the
   testimony of the water and blood; it is he who by his power makes the
   fruit of Christ's death to come to us; yea, he makes the blood shed for
   our redemption to penetrate into our hearts, or, to say all in one
   word, he makes Christ with all his blessings to become ours. So Paul,
   in Romans 1:4, after having said that Christ by his resurrection
   manifested himself to be the Son of God, immediately adds, "Through the
   sanctification of the Spirit." For whatever signs of divine glory may
   shine forth in Christ, they would yet be obscure to us and escape our
   vision, were not the Holy Spirit to open for us the eyes of faith.

   Readers may now understand why John adduced the Spirit as a witness
   together with the water and the blood, even because it is the peculiar
   office of the Spirit, to cleanse our consciences by the blood of
   Christ, to cause the cleansing effected by it to be efficacious. On
   this subject some remarks are made at the beginning of the Second
   Epistle of Peter, [95] where he uses nearly the same mode of speaking,
   that is, that the Holy Spirit cleanses our hearts by the sprinkling of
   the blood of Christ. [96]

   But from these words we may learn, that faith does not lay hold on a
   bare or an empty Christ, but that his power is at the same time
   vivifying. For to what purpose has Christ been sent on the earth,
   except to reconcile God by the sacrifice of his death? except the
   office of washing had been allotted to him by the Father?

   It may however be objected, that the distinction here mentioned is
   superfluous, because Christ cleansed us by expiating our sins; then the
   Apostle mentions the same thing twice. I indeed allow that cleansing is
   included in expiation; therefore I made no difference between the water
   and the blood, as though they were distinct; but if any one of us
   considers his own infirmity, he will readily acknowledge that it is not
   in vain or without reason that blood is distinguished from the water.
   Besides, the Apostle, as it has been stated, alludes to the rites of
   the law; and God, on account of human infirmity, had formerly
   appointed, not only sacrifices, but also washings. And the Apostle
   meant distinctly to show that the reality of both has been exhibited in
   Christ, and on this account he had said before, "Not by water only,"
   for he means, that not only some part of our salvation is found in
   Christ, but the whole of it, so that nothing is to be sought elsewhere.

   9 If we receive the witness, or testimony, of men He proves, reasoning
   from the less to the greater, how ungrateful men are when they reject
   Christ, who has been approved, as he has related, by God; for if in
   worldly affairs we stand to the words of men, who may lie and deceive,
   how unreasonable it is that God should have less credit given to him,
   when sitting as it were on his own throne, where he is the supreme
   judge. Then our own corruption alone prevents us to receive Christ,,
   since he gives us full proof for believing in his power. Besides, he
   calls not only that the testimony of God which the Spirit imprints on
   our hearts, but also that which we derive from the water and the blood.
   For that power of cleansing and expiating was not earthly, but
   heavenly. Hence the blood of Christ is not to be estimated according to
   the common manner of men; but we must rather look to the design of God,
   who ordained it for blotting out sins, and also to that divine efficacy
   which flows from it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [94] Calvin probably refers to printed copies in his day, and not to
   Greek MSS. As far as the authority of MSS. and versions and quotations
   goes, the passage is spurious, for it is not found in any of the Greek
   MSS prior to the 16th century, nor in any of the early versions, except
   the Latin, nor in some of the copies of that version; nor is it quoted
   by any of the early Greek fathers, nor by early Latin fathers, except a
   very few, and even their quotations have been disputed. These are facts
   which no refined conjectures can upset; and it is to be regretted that
   learned men, such as the late Bishop Burgess, should have labored and
   toiled in an attempt so hopeless as to establish the genuineness of
   this verse, or rather of a part of this verse, and of the beginning of
   the following. The whole passage is as follows, the spurious part being
   put within crotchets, -- 7. "For there are three who bear witness [in
   heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are
   one: 8. And there are three who bear witness in earth,] the Spirit and
   the water and the blood; and these three agree in one." As to the
   construction of the passage, as far as grammar and sense are concerned,
   it may do with or without the interpolation equally the same. What has
   been said to the contrary on this point, seems to be nothing of a
   decisive character, in no way sufficient to shew that the words are not
   spurious. Indeed, the passage reads better without the interpolated
   words; and as to the sense, that is, the sense in which they are
   commonly taken by the advocates of their genuineness, it has no
   connection whatever with the general drift of the passage. -- Ed.

   [95] Although the commentary in [10]2Peter1:9 seems to be close to what
   Calvin is talking of here, it may be that perhaps the [11]First Epistle
   of Peter might be the one he had in mind. - fj.

   [96] If we exclude the words deemed interpolated, we may read the
   passage thus: "This is he who came with water and blood, even Jesus
   Christ; not with water only, but with water and blood: the Spirit also
   beareth witness, for (or seeing that) the Spirit is truth (or, is
   true); because there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, the water,
   and the blood, and these three agree in one. We see hence a reason why
   the Spirit is said to be true, even because he is not alone, for the
   water and the blood concur with him. Thus a testimony is formed
   consistently with the requirement of the law. We hence also see the
   import of what is stated when the testimony of men is mentioned, as
   though he had said, The testimony of three men is received as valid,
   how much more valid is the testimony of God, which has three witnesses
   in its behalf? It is called God's testimony, because the witnesses have
   been ordered and appointed by him. When it is said that he came with
   water and blood, the meaning is, that he came, having water and blood;
   the proposition dia has sometimes this meaning, and it is changed in
   the second clause into en. We meet with similar instances in 2
   Corinthians 3:11, and in 2 Corinthians 4:11. See Romans 2:27; 4:11
   According to this construction, the explanation of Calvin is alone the
   right one, that the water means cleansing, and the blood expiation, the
   terms being borrowed from the rites of the law; and a reference is also
   made to the law when the witness of men is mentioned. -- Ed.

   1 John 5:9-12

   9. -- For this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his
   Son.

   9. -- Porro hoc est testimonium Dei, quod testificatus est de Filio
   suo.

   10. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he
   that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not
   the record that God gave of his Son.

   10. Qui credit in Filium Dei, habet testimonium in seipso; qui non
   credit Deo, mendacem facit eum; quia non credidit in testimonium quod
   testificatus est Deus de Filio suo.

   11. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and
   this life is in his Son.

   11. Et hoc est testimonium, quod vitam aeternam dedit nobis Deus; et
   haec vita in Filio ejus est.

   12. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God
   hath not life.

   12. Qui habet Filium, habet vitam; qui non habet Filium Dei, vitam non
   habet.


   9 For this is the witness, or testimony, of God The particle hoti does
   not mean here the cause, but is to be taken as explanatory; for the
   Apostle, after having reminded us that God deserves to be believed much
   more than men, now adds, that we can have no faith in God, except by
   believing in Christ, because God sets him alone before us and makes us
   to stand in him. He hence infers that we believe safely and with
   tranquil minds in Christ, because God by his authority warrants our
   faith. He does not say that God speaks outwardly, but that every one of
   the godly feels within that God is the author of his faith. It hence
   appears how different from faith is a fading opinion dependent on
   something else.

   10. He that believeth not As the faithful possess this benefit, that
   they know themselves to be beyond the danger of erring, because they
   have God as their foundation; so he makes the ungodly to be guilty of
   extreme blasphemy, because they charge God with falsehood. Doubtless
   nothing is more valued by God than his own truth, therefore no wrong
   more atrocious can be done to him, than to rob him of this honor. Then
   in order to induce us to believe, he takes an argument from the
   opposite side; for if to make God a liar be a horrible and execrable
   impiety, because then what especially belongs to him is taken away, who
   would not dread to withhold faith from the gospel, in which God would
   have himself to be counted singularly true and faithful? This ought to
   be carefully observed.

   Some wonder why God commends faith so much, why unbelief is so severely
   condemned. But the glory of God is implicated in this; for since he
   designed to shew a special instance of his truth in the gospel, all
   they who reject Christ there offered to them, leave nothing to him.
   Therefore, though we may grant that a man in other parts of his life is
   like an angel, yet his sanctity is diabolical as long as he rejects
   Christ. Thus we see some under the Papacy vastly pleased with the mere
   mask of sanctity, while they still most obstinately resist the gospel.
   Let us then understand, that it is the beginning of true religion,
   obediently to embrace this doctrine, which he has so strongly confirmed
   by his testimony.

   11 That God hath given us eternal life Having now set forth the
   benefit, he invites us to believe. It is, indeed, a reverence due to
   God, immediately to receive, as beyond controversy, whatever he
   declares to us. But since he freely offers life to us, our ingratitude
   will be intolerable, except with prompt faith we receive a doctrine so
   sweet and so lovely. And, doubtless, the words of the Apostle are
   intended to shew, that we ought, not only reverently to obey the
   gospel, lest we should affront God; but, that we ought to love it,
   because it brings to us eternal life. We hence also learn what is
   especially to be sought in the gospel, even the free gift of salvation;
   for that God there exhorts us to repentance and fear, ought not to be
   separated from the grace of Christ.

   But the Apostle, that he might keep us together in Christ, again
   repeats that life is found in him; as though he had said, that no other
   way of obtaining life has been appointed for us by God the Father. And
   the Apostle, indeed, briefly includes here three things: that we are
   all given up to death until God in his gratuitous favor restores us to
   life; for he plainly declares that life is a gift from God: and hence
   also it follows that we are destitute of it, and that it cannot be
   acquired by merits; secondly, he teaches us that this life is conferred
   on us by the gospel, because there the goodness and the paternal love
   of God is made known to us; lastly, he says that we cannot otherwise
   become partakers of this life than by believing in Christ.

   12 He that hath not the Son This is a confirmation of the last
   sentence. It ought, indeed, to have been sufficient, that God made life
   to be in none but in Christ, that it might be sought in him; but lest
   any one should turn away to another, he excludes all from the hope of
   life who seek it not in Christ. We know what it is to have Christ, for
   he is possessed by faith. He then shews that all who are separated from
   the body of Christ are without life.

   But this seems inconsistent with reason; for history shews that there
   have been great men, endued with heroic virtues, who yet were wholly
   unacquainted with Christ; and it seems unreasonable that men of so
   great eminence had no honor. To this I answer, that we are greatly
   mistaken if we think that whatever is eminent in our eyes is approved
   by God; for, as it is said in Luke,

   "What is highly esteemed by men is an abomination with God." (Luke
   16:15)

   For as the filthiness of the heart is hid from us, we are satisfied
   with the external appearance; but God sees that under this is concealed
   the foulest filth. It is, therefore, no wonder if specious virtues,
   flowing from an impure heart, and tending to no right end, have an ill
   odor to him. Besides, whence comes purity, whence a genuine regard for
   religion, except from the Spirit of Christ? There is, then, nothing
   worthy of praise except in Christ.

   There is, further, another reason which removes every doubt; for the
   righteousness of men is in the remission of sins. If you take away
   this, the sure curse of God and eternal death awaits all. Christ alone
   is he who reconciles the Father to us, as he has once for all pacified
   him by the sacrifice of the cross. It hence follows, that God is
   propitious to none but in Christ, nor is there righteousness but in
   him.

   Were any one to object and say, that Cornelius, as mentioned by Luke,
   (Acts 10:2,) was accepted of God before he was called to the faith of
   the gospel: to this I answer shortly, that God sometimes so deals with
   us, that the seed of faith appears immediately on the first day.
   Cornelius had no clear and distinct knowledge of Christ; but as he had
   some perception of God's mercy, he must at the same time understand
   something of a Mediator. But as God acts in ways hidden and wonderful,
   let us disregard those speculations which profit nothing, and hold only
   to that plain way of salvation, which he has made known to us.

   1 John 5:13-15

   13. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of
   the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye
   may believe on the name of the Son of God.

   13. Haec scripsi vebis credentibus in nomen Filii Dei, ut sciatis quod
   vitam habetis aeternam, et ut credatis in nomen Filii Dei.

   14. And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any
   thing according to his will, he heareth us:

   14. Atque haec est fiducia quam habemus erga eum, quod si quid
   petierimus secundum voluntatem ejus, audit nos.

   15. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we
   have the petitions that we desired of him.

   15. Si autem novimus quod audit nos, quum quid petierimus; novimus quod
   habemus petitiones quas postulavimus ab eo.


   13 These things have I written unto you As there ought to be a daily
   progress in faith, so he says that he wrote to those who had already
   believed, so that they might believe more firmly and with greater
   certainty, and thus enjoy a fuller confidence as to eternal life. Then
   the use of doctrine is, not only to initiate the ignorant in the
   knowledge of Christ, but also to confirm those more and more who have
   been already taught. It therefore becomes us assiduously to attend to
   the duty of learning, that our faith may increase through the whole
   course of our life. For there are still in us many remnants of
   unbelief, and so weak is our faith that what we believe is not yet
   really believed except there be a fuller confirmation.

   But we ought to observe the way in which faith is confirmed, even by
   having the office and power of Christ explained to us. For the Apostle
   says that he wrote these things, that is, that eternal life is to be
   sought nowhere else but in Christ, in order that they who were
   believers already might believe, that is, make progress in believing.
   It is therefore the duty of a godly teacher, in order to confirm
   disciples in the faith, to extol as much as possible the grace of
   Christ, so that being satisfied with that, we may seek nothing else.

   As the Papists obscure this truth in various ways, and extenuate it,
   they shew sufficiently by this one thing that they care for nothing
   less than for the right doctrine of faith; yea, on this account, their
   schools ought to be more shunned than all the Scyllas and Charybdises
   in the world; for hardly any one can enter them without a sure
   shipwreck to his faith.

   The Apostle teaches further in this passage, that Christ is the
   peculiar object of faith, and that to the faith which we have in his
   name is annexed the hope of salvation. For in this case the end of
   believing is, that we become the children and the heirs of God.

   14 And this is the confidence He commends the faith which he mentioned
   by its fruit, or he shews that in which our confidence especially is,
   that is, that the godly dare confidently to call on God; as also Paul
   speaks in Ephesians 3:12, that we have by faith access to God with
   confidence; and also in Romans 8:15, that the Spirit gives us a mouth
   to cry Abba, Father. And doubtless, were we driven away from an access
   to God, nothing could make us more miserable; but, on the other hand,
   provided this asylum be opened to us, we should be happy even in
   extreme evils; nay, this one thing renders our troubles blessed,
   because we surely know that God will be our deliverer, and relying on
   his paternal love towards us, we flee to him.

   Let us, then, bear in mind this declaration of the Apostle, that
   calling on God is the chief trial of our faith, and that God is not
   rightly nor in faith called upon except we be fully persuaded that our
   prayers will not be in vain. For the Apostle denies that those who,
   being doubtful, hesitate, are endued with faith.

   It hence appears that the doctrine of faith is buried and nearly
   extinct under the Papacy, for all certainty is taken away. They indeed
   mutter many prayers, and prattle much about praying to God; but they
   pray with doubtful and fluctuating hearts, and bid us to pray; and yet
   they even condemn this confidence which the Apostle requires as
   necessary.

   According to his will By this expression he meant by the way to remind
   us what is the right way or rule of praying, even when men subject
   their own wishes to God. For though God has promised to do whatsoever
   his people may ask, yet he does not allow them an unbridled liberty to
   ask whatever may come to their minds; but he has at the same time
   prescribed to them a law according to which they are to pray. And
   doubtless nothing is better for us than this restriction; for if it was
   allowed to every one of us to ask what he pleased, and if God were to
   indulge us in our wishes, it would be to provide very badly for us. For
   what may be expedient we know not; nay, we boil over with corrupt and
   hurtful desires. But God supplies a twofold remedy, lest we should pray
   otherwise than according to what his own will has prescribed; for he
   teaches us by his word what he would have us to ask, and he has also
   set over us his Spirit as our guide and ruler, to restrain our
   feelings, so as not to suffer them to wander beyond due bounds. For
   what or how to pray, we know not, says Paul, but the Spirit helpeth our
   infirmity, and excites in us unutterable groans. (Romans 8:26.) We
   ought also to ask the mouth of the Lord to direct and guide our
   prayers; for God in his promises has fixed for us, as it has been said,
   the right way of praying.

   15 And if we know This is not a superfluous repetition, as it seems to
   be; for what the Apostle declared in general respecting the success of
   prayer, he now affirms in a special manner that the godly pray or ask
   for nothing from God but what they obtain. But when he says that all
   the petitions of the faithful are heard, he speaks of right and humble
   petitions, and such as are consistent with the rule of obedience. For
   the faithful do not give loose reins to their desires, nor indulge in
   anything that may please them, but always regard in their prayers what
   God commands.

   This, then, is an application of the general doctrine to the special
   and private benefit of every one, lest the faithful should doubt that
   God is propitious to prayers of each individual, so that with quiet
   minds they may wait until the Lord should perform what they pray for,
   and that being thus relieved from all trouble and anxiety, they may
   cast on God the burden of their cares. This ease and security ought
   not, however, to abate in them their earnestness in prayer, for he who
   is certain of a happy event ought not to abstain from praying to God.
   For the certainty of faith by no means generates indifference or sloth.
   The Apostle meant; that every one should be tranquil in these
   necessities when he has deposited his sighs in the bosom of God.

   1 John 5:16-18

   16. If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he
   shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.
   There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.

   16. Si quis viderit fratrem suum peccantem peccato non ad mortem,
   petet; et dabit illi vitam peecanti, dico, non ad mortem: est peccatum
   ad mortem; non pro illo, dico, ut quis roget.

   17. All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.

   17. Omnis injustitia peccatum est; et est peccatum non ad mortem.

   18. We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is
   begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.

   18. Novlinus quod quisquis ex Deo genitus est, non peccat; sed qui
   genitus est ex Deo servat seipsum, et malignus non tangit eum.


   16 If any man The Apostle extends still further the benefits of that
   faith which he has mentioned, so that our prayers may also avail for
   our brethren. It is a great thing, that as soon as we are oppressed,
   God kindly invites us to himself, and is ready to give us help; but
   that he hears us asking for others, is no small confirmation to our
   faith in order that we may be fully assured that we shall never meet
   with a repulse in our own case.

   The Apostle in the meantime exhorts us to be mutually solicitous for
   the salvation of one another; and he would also have us to regard the
   falls of the brethren as stimulants to prayer. And surely it is an iron
   hardness to be touched with no pity, when we see souls redeemed by
   Christ's blood going to ruin. But he shews that there is at hand a
   remedy, by which brethren can aid brethren. He who will pray for the
   perishing, will, he says, restore life to him; though the words, "he
   shall give," may be applied to God, as though it was said, God will
   grant to your prayers the life of a brother. But the sense will still
   be the same, that the prayers of the faithful so far avail as to rescue
   a brother from death. If we understand man to be intended, that he will
   give life to a brother, it is a hyperbolical expression; it however
   contains nothing inconsistent; for what is given to us by the
   gratuitous goodness of God, yea, what is granted to others for our
   sake, we are said to give to others. So great a benefit ought to
   stimulate us not a little to ask for our brethren the forgiveness of
   sins. And when the Apostle recommends sympathy to us, he at the same
   time reminds us how much we ought to avoid the cruelty of condemning
   our brethren, or an extreme rigor in despairing of their salvation.

   A sin which is not unto death That we may not cast away all hope of the
   salvation of those who sin, he shews that God does not so grievously
   punish their falls as to repudiate them. It hence follows that we ought
   to deem them brethren, since God retains them in the number of his
   children. For he denies that sins are to death, not only those by which
   the saints daily offend, but even when it happens that God's wrath is
   grievously provoked by them. For as long as room for pardon is left,
   death does not wholly retain its dominion.

   The Apostle, however, does not here distinguish between venial and
   mortal sin, as it was afterwards commonly done. For altogether foolish
   is that distinction which prevails under the Papacy. The Sorbons
   acknowledge that there is hardly a mortal sin, except there be the
   grossest baseness, such as may be, as it were, tangible. Thus in venial
   sins they think that there may be the greatest filth, if hidden in the
   soul. In short, they suppose that all the fruits of original sin,
   provided they appear not outwardly, are washed away by the slight
   sprinkling of holy water! And what wonder is it, since they regard not
   as blasphemous sins, doubts respecting God's grace, or any lusts or
   evil desires, except they are consented to? If the soul of man be
   assailed by unbelief, if impatience tempts him to rage against God,
   whatever monstrous lusts may allure him, all these are to the Papists
   lighter than to be deemed sins, at least after baptism. It is then no
   wonder, that they make venial offenses of the greatest crimes; for they
   weigh them in their own balance and not in the balance of God.

   But among the faithful this ought to be an indubitable truth, that
   whatever is contrary to God's law is sin, and in its nature mortal; for
   where there is a transgression of the law, there is sin and death.

   What, then, is the meaning of the Apostle? He denies that sins are
   mortal, which, though worthy of death, are yet not thus punished by
   God. He therefore does not estimate sins in themselves, but forms a
   judgment of them according to the paternal kindness of God, which
   pardons the guilt, where yet the fault is. In short, God does not give
   over to death those whom he has restored to life, though it depends not
   on them that they are not alienated from life.

   There is a sin unto death I have already said that the sin to which
   there is no hope of pardon left, is thus called. But it may be asked,
   what this is; for it must be very atrocious, when God thus so severely
   punishes it. It may be gathered from the context, that it is not, as
   they say, a partial fall, or a transgression of a single commandment,
   but apostasy, by which men wholly alienate themselves from God. For the
   Apostle afterwards adds, that the children of God do not sin, that is,
   that they do not forsake God, and wholly surrender themselves to Satan,
   to be his slaves. Such a defection, it is no wonder that it is mortal;
   for God never thus deprives his own people of the grace of the Spirit;
   but they ever retain some spark of true religion. They must then be
   reprobate and given up to destruction, who thus fall away so as to have
   no fear of God.

   Were any one to ask, whether the door of salvation is closed against
   their repentance; the answer is obvious, that as they are given up to a
   reprobate mind, and are destitute of the Holy Spirit, they cannot do
   anything else, than with obstinate minds, become worse and worse, and
   add sins to sins. Moreover, as the sin and blasphemy against the Spirit
   ever brings with it a defection of this kind, there is no doubt but
   that it is here pointed out.

   But it may be asked again, by what evidences can we know that a man's
   fall is fatal; for except the knowledge of this was certain, in vain
   would the Apostle have made this exception, that they were not to pray
   for a sin of this kind. It is then right to determine sometimes,
   whether the fallen is without hope, or whether there is still a place
   for a remedy. This, indeed, is what I allow, and what is evident beyond
   dispute from this passage; but as this very seldom happens, and as God
   sets before us the infinite riches of his grace, and bids us to be
   merciful according to his own example, we ought not rashly to conclude
   that any one has brought on himself the judgment of eternal death; on
   the contrary, love should dispose us to hope well. But if the impiety
   of some appear to us not otherwise than hopeless, as though the Lord
   pointed it out by the finger, we ought not to contend with the just
   judgment of God, or seek to be more merciful than he is.

   17 All unrighteousness This passage may be explained variously. If you
   take it adversatively, the sense would not be unsuitable, "Though all
   unrighteousness is sin, yet every sin is not unto death." And equally
   suitable is another meaning, "As sin is every unrighteousness, hence it
   follows that every sin is not unto death." Some take all
   unrighteousness for complete unrighteousness, as though the Apostle had
   said, that the sin of which he spoke was the summit of unrighteousness.
   I, however, am more disposed to embrace the first or the second
   explanation; and as the result is nearly the same, I leave it to the
   judgment of readers to determine which of the two is the more
   appropriate.

   18 We know that whosoever is born of God If you suppose that God's
   children are wholly pure and free from all sin, as the fanatics
   contend, then the Apostle is inconsistent with himself; for he would
   thus take away the duty of mutual prayer among brethren. Then he says
   that those sin not who do not wholly fall away from the grace of God;
   and hence he inferred that prayer ought to be made for all the children
   of God, because they sin not unto death. A proof is added, that every
   one, born of God, keeps himself, that is, keeps himself in the fear of
   God; nor does he suffer himself to be so led away, as to lose all sense
   of religion, and to surrender himself wholly to the devil and the
   flesh.

   For when he says, that he is not touched by that wicked one, reference
   is made to a deadly wound; for the children of God do not remain
   untouched by the assaults of Satan, but they ward off his strokes by
   the shield of faith, so that they do not penetrate into the heart.
   Hence spiritual life is never extinguished in them. This is not to sin.
   Though the faithful indeed fall through the infirmity of the flesh, yet
   they groan under the burden of sin, loathe themselves, and cease not to
   fear God.

   Keepeth himself. What properly belongs to God he transfers to us; for
   were any one of us the keeper of his own salvation, it would be a
   miserable protection. Therefore Christ asks the Father to keep us,
   intimating that it is not done by our own strength. The advocates of
   freewill lay hold on this expression, that they may thence prove, that
   we are preserved from sin, partly by God's grace, and partly by our own
   power. But they do not perceive that the faithful have not from
   themselves the power of preservation of which the Apostle speaks. Nor
   does he, indeed, speak of their power, as though they could keep
   themselves by their own strength; but he only shews that they ought to
   resist Satan, so that they may never be fatally wounded by his darts.
   And we know that we fight with no other weapons but those of God. Hence
   the faithful keep themselves from sin, as far as they are kept by God.
   (John 17:11.)

   1 John 5:19-21

   19 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
   wickedness.

   19. Novimus quod ex Deo sumus, et mundus torus in maligno positus est.

   20. And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
   understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him
   that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and
   eternal life.

   20. Novimus autem quod Filius Dei venit, et dedit nobis intelligentiam,
   ut cognoscamus illum verum; et sumus in ipso vero, in Filio ejus Jesu
   Christo: Hic est verus Deus, et vita aeterna.

   21. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

   21. Filioli, custodite vos ab idolis. Amen.


   19 We are of God He deduces an exhortation from his previous doctrine;
   for what he had declared in common as to the children of God, he now
   applies to those he was writing to; and this he did, to stimulate them
   to beware of sin, and to encourage them to repel the onsets of Satan.

   Let readers observe, that it is only true faith, that applies to us, so
   to speak, the grace of God; for the Apostle acknowledges none as
   faithful, but those who have the dignity of being God's children. Nor
   does he indeed put probable conjecture, as the Sophists speak, for
   confidence; for he says that we know. The meaning is, that as we have
   been born of God, we ought to strive to prove by our separation from
   the world, and by the sanctity of our life, that we have not been in
   vain called to so great all honor.

   Now, this is an admonition very necessary for all the godly; for
   wherever they turn their eyes, Satan has his allurements prepared, by
   which he seeks to draw them away from God. It would then be difficult
   for them to hold on in their course, were they not so to value their
   calling as to disregard all the hindrances of the world. Then, in order
   to be well prepared for the contest, these two things must be borne in
   mind, that the world is wicked, and that our calling is from God.

   Under the term world, the Apostle no doubt includes the whole human
   race. By saying that it lieth in the wicked one, he represents it as
   being under the dominion of Satan. There is then no reason why we
   should hesitate to shun the world, which condemns God and delivers up
   itself into the bondage of Satan: nor is there a reason why we should
   fear its enmity, because it is alienated from God. In short, since
   corruption pervades all nature, the faithful ought to study
   self-denial; and since nothing is seen in the world but wickedness and
   corruption, they must necessarily disregard flesh and blood that they
   may follow God. At the same time the other thing ought to be added,
   that God is he who has called them, that under this protection they may
   oppose all the machinations of the world and Satan.

   20 And we know that the Son of God is come As the children of God are
   assailed on every side, he, as we have said, encourages and exhorts
   them to persevere in resisting their enemies, and for this reason,
   because they fight under the banner of God, and certainly know that
   they are ruled by his Spirit; but he now reminds them where this
   knowledge is especially to be found.

   He then says that God has been so made known to us, that now there is
   no reason for doubting. The Apostle does not without reason dwell on
   this point; for except our faith is really founded on God, we shall
   never stand firm in the contest. For this purpose the Apostle shews
   that we have obtained through Christ a sure knowledge of the true God,
   so that we may not fluctuate in uncertainty.

   By true God he does not mean one who tells the truth, but him who is
   really God; and he so calls him to distinguishing him from all idols.
   Thus true is in opposition to what is fictitious; for it is alethinos,
   and not alethes A similar passage is in John

   "This is eternal life, to know thee,
   the only true God,
   and him whom thou hast sent,
   Jesus Christ."
   (John 17:3)

   And he justly ascribes to Christ this office of illuminating our minds
   as to the knowledge of God. For, as he is the only true image of the
   invisible God, as he is the only interpreter of the Father, as he is
   the only guide of life, yea, as he is the life and light of the world
   and the truth, as soon as we depart from him, we necessarily become
   vain in our own devices.

   And Christ is said to have given us an understanding, not only because
   he shews us in the gospel what sort of being is the true God, and also
   illuminates us by his Spirit; but because in Christ himself we have God
   manifested in the flesh, as Paul says, since in him dwells all the
   fullness of the Deity, and are hid all the treasures of knowledge and
   wisdom. (Colossians 2:9.) Thus it is that the face of God in a manner
   appears to us in Christ; not that there was no knowledge, or a doubtful
   knowledge of God, before the coming of Christ,, but that now he
   manifests himself more fully and more clearly. And this is what Paul
   says in 2 Corinthians 4:6, that

   God, who formerly commanded light to shine out of darkness at the
   creation of the world, hath now shone in our hearts through the
   brightness of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Christ.

   And it must be observed, that this gift is peculiar to the elect.
   Christ, indeed, kindles for all indiscriminately the torch of his
   gospel; but all have not the eyes of their minds opened to see it, but
   on the contrary Satan spreads the veil of blindness over many. Then the
   Apostle means the light which Christ kindles within in the hearts of
   his people, and which when once kindled, is never extinguished, though
   in some it may for a time be smothered.

   We are in him that is true By these words he reminds us how efficacious
   is that knowledge which he mentions, even because by it we are united
   to Christ; and become one with God; for it has a living root, fixed in
   the heart, by which it comes that God lives in us and we in him. As he
   says, without a copulative, that: we are in him that is true, in his
   Son, he seems to express the manner of our union with God, as though he
   had said, that we are in God through Christ. [97]

   This is the true God Though the Arians have attempted to elude this
   passage, and some agree with them at this day, yet we have here a
   remarkable testimony to the divinity of Christ. The Arians apply this
   passage to the Father, as though the Apostle should again repeat that
   he is the true God. But nothing could be more frigid than such a
   repetition. It has already twice testified that the true God is he who
   has been made known to us in Christ, why should he again add, This is
   the true God? It applies, indeed, most suitably to Christ; for after
   having taught us that Christ is the guide by whose hand we are led to
   God, he now, by way of amplifying, affirms that Christ is that God,
   lest we should think that we are to seek further; and he confirms this
   view by what is added, and eternal life. It is doubtless the same that
   is spoken of, as being the true God and eternal life. I pass by this,
   that the relative houtos usually refers to the last person. I say,
   then, that Christ is properly called eternal life; and that this mode
   of speaking perpetually occurs in John, no one can deny.

   The meaning is, that when we have Christ, we enjoy the true and eternal
   God, for nowhere else is he to be sought; and, secondly, that we become
   thus partakers of eternal life, because it is offered to us in Christ
   though hid in the Father. The origin of life is, indeed, the Father;
   but the fountain from which we are to draw it, is Christ.

   21 Keep yourselves from idols Though this be a separate sentence, yet
   it is as it were an appendix to the preceding doctrine. For the
   vivifying light of the Gospel ought to scatter and dissipate, not only
   darkness, but also all mists, from the minds of the godly. The Apostle
   not only condemns idolatry, but commands us to beware of all images and
   idols; by which he intimates, that the worship of God cannot continue
   uncorrupted and pure whenever men begin to be in love with idols or
   images. For so innate in us is superstition, that the least occasion
   will infect us with its contagion. Dry wood will not so easily burn
   when coals are put under it, as idolatry will lay hold on and engross
   the minds of men, when an occasion is given to them. And who does not
   see that images are the sparks? What sparks do I say? nay, rather
   torches, which are sufficient to set the whole world on fire.

   The Apostle at the same time does not only speak of statues, but also
   of altars, and includes all the instruments of superstitions. Moreover,
   the Papists are ridiculous, who pervert this passage and apply it to
   the statues of Jupiter and Mercury and the like, as though the Apostle
   did not teach generally, that there is a corruption of religion
   whenever a corporeal form is ascribed to God, or whenever statues and
   pictures form a part of his worship. Let us then remember that we ought
   carefully to continue in the spiritual worship of God, so as to banish
   far from us everything that may turn us aside to gross and carnal
   superstitions.

   end of the first epistle of John
     __________________________________________________________________

   [97] It is rendered by some, "through his Son Jesus Christ." Our
   version, "even in his Son Jesus Christ," seems not to be right, as it
   makes "him that is true," to be the Son, while the reference is to God,
   as in the previous clause. The true meaning would be thus conveyed,
   "And we are in the true God, being in his Son Jesus Christ;" for to be
   in Christ, is to be in God. Three MSS., the Vulgate, and several of the
   Fathers, read thus, "and we are in his true Son Jesus Christ". -- Ed.

   THE ARGUMENT

   It appears from the writings of Jerome and Eusebius, that this Epistle
   was not formerly received by many Churches without opposition. There
   are also at this day some who do not think it entitled to authority. I,
   however, am inclined to receive it without controversy, because I see
   no just cause for rejecting it. For what seems in the second chapter to
   be inconsistent with the doctrine of free justification, we shall
   easily explain in its own place. Though he seems more sparing in
   proclaiming the grace of Christ than it behooved an Apostle to be, it
   is not surely required of all to handle the same arguments. The
   writings of Solomon differ much from those of David; while the former
   was intent on forming the outward man and teaching the precepts of
   civil life, the latter spoke continually of the spiritual worship of
   God, peace of conscience, God's mercy and gratuitous promise of
   salvation. But this diversity should not make us to approve of one, and
   to condemn the other. Besides, among the evangelists themselves there
   is so much difference in setting forth the power of Christ, that the
   other three, compared with John, have hardly sparks of that full
   brightness which appears so conspicuous in him, and yet we commend them
   all alike.

   It is enough to make men to receive this Epistle, that it contains
   nothing unworthy of an Apostle of Christ. It is indeed full of
   instruction on various subjects, the benefit of which extends to every
   part of the Christian life; for there are here remarkable passages on
   patience, prayer to God, the excellency and fruit of heavenly truth,
   humility, holy duties, the restraining of the tongue, the cultivation
   of peace, the repressing of lusts, the contempt of the world, and the
   like things, which we shall separately discuss in their own places.

   But as to the author, there is somewhat more reason for doubting. It is
   indeed certain that he was not the Son of Zebedee, for Herod killed him
   shortly after our Lord's resurrection. The ancients are nearly
   unanimous in thinking that he was one of the disciples named Oblias and
   a relative of Christ, who was set over the Church at Jerusalem; and
   they supposed him to have been the person whom Paul mentioned with
   Peter and John, who he says were deemed pillars, (Galatians 2:9.) But
   that one of the disciples was mentioned as one of the three pillars,
   and thus exalted above the other Apostles, does not seem to me
   probable. I am therefore rather inclined to the conjecture, that he of
   whom Paul speaks was the son of Alpheus. I do not yet deny that another
   was the ruler of the Church at Jerusalem, and one indeed from the
   college of the disciples; for the Apostles were not tied to any
   particular place. But whether of the two was the writer of this
   Epistle, it is not for me to say. That Oblias was actually a man of
   great authority among the Jews, appears even from this, that as he had
   been cruelly put to death by the faction of an ungodly chief-priest,
   Josephus hesitated not to impute the destruction of the city in part to
   his death.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 1:1-4

   1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve
   tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

   1 Jacobus, Dei ac Domini Jesu Christi servus, duodecim tribubus quae in
   dispersione sunt, salutem.

   2 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;

   2 Omne gaudium existimate, fratres mei, quum in tentationes varias
   incideritis;

   3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

   3 Scientes quod probatio fidei vestrae, patientiam operatur

   4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
   entire, wanting nothing.

   4 Patientia vero opus perfectum habeat, ut sitis perfecti et integri,
   in nullo deficientes.


   1 To the twelve tribes. When the ten tribes were banished, the Assyrian
   king placed them in different parts. Afterwards, as it usually happens
   in the revolutions of kingdoms (such as then took place,) it is very
   probable that they moved here and there in all directions. And the Jews
   had been scattered almost unto all quarters of the world. He then wrote
   and exhorted all those whom he could not personally address, because
   they had been scattered far and wide. But that he speaks not of the
   grace of Christ and of faith in him, the reason seems to be this,
   because he addressed those who had already been rightly taught by
   others; so that they had need, not so much of doctrine, as of the goads
   of exhortations. [98]

   2 All joy. The first exhortation is, to bear trials with a cheerful
   mind. And it was especially necessary at that time to comfort the Jews,
   almost overwhelmed as they were with troubles. For the very name of the
   nation was so infamous, that they were hated and despised by all people
   wherever they went; and their condition as Christians rendered them
   still more miserable, because they held their own nation as their most
   inveterate enemies. At the same time, this consolation was not so
   suited to one time, but that it is always useful to believers, whose
   life is a constant warfare on earth.

   But that we may know more fully what he means, we must doubtless take
   temptations or trials as including all adverse things; and they are so
   called, because they are the tests of our obedience to God. He bids the
   faithful, while exercised with these, to rejoice; and that not only
   when they fall into one temptation, but into many, not only of one
   kind, but of various kinds. And doubtless, since they serve to mortify
   our flesh, as the vices of the flesh continually shoot up in us, so
   they must necessarily be often repeated. Besides, as we labor under
   diseases, so it is no wonder that different remedies are applied to
   remove them.

   The Lord then afflicts us in various ways, because ambition, avarice,
   envy, gluttony, intemperance, excessive love of the world, and the
   innumerable lusts in which we abound, cannot be cured by the same
   medicine.

   When he bids us to count it all joy, it is the same as though he had
   said, that temptations ought to be so deemed as gain, as to be regarded
   as occasions of joy. He means, in short, that there is nothing in
   afflictions which ought to disturb our joy. And thus, he not only
   commands us to bear adversities calmly, and with an even mind, but
   shews us that this is a reason why the faithful should rejoice when
   pressed down by them.

   It is, indeed, certain, that all the senses of our nature are so
   formed, that every trial produces in us grief and sorrow; and no one of
   us can so far divest himself of his nature as not to grieve and be
   sorrowful whenever he feels any evil. But this does not prevent the
   children of God to rise, by the guidance of the Spirit, above the
   sorrow of the flesh. Hence it is, that in the midst of trouble they
   cease not to rejoice.

   3 Knowing this, that the trying. We now see why he called adversities
   trials or temptations, even because they serve to try our faith. And
   there is here a reason given to confirm the last sentence. For it
   might, on the other hand, be objected, "How comes it, that we judge
   that sweet which to the sense is bitter?" He then shews by the effect
   that we ought to rejoice in afflictions, because they produce fruit
   that ought to be highly valued, even patience. If God then provides for
   our salvation, he affords us an occasion of rejoicing. Peter uses a
   similar argument at the beginning of his first Epistle, "That the trial
   of your faith, more precious than gold, may be," etc. [1Peter 1:7.] We
   certainly dread diseases, and want, and exile, and prison, and
   reproach, and death, because we regard them as evils; but when we
   understand that they are turned through God's kindness unto helps and
   aids to our salvation, it is ingratitude to murmur, and not willingly
   to submit to be thus paternally dealt with.

   Paul says, in Romans 5:3, that we are to glory in tribulations; and
   James says here, that we are to rejoice. "We glory," says Paul, "in
   tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience." What
   immediately follows seems contrary to the words of James; for he
   mentions probation in the third place, as the effect of patience, which
   is here put first as though it were the cause. But the solution is
   obvious; the word there has an active, but here a passive meaning.
   Probation or trial is said by James to produce patience; for were not
   God to try us, but leave us free from trouble, there would be no
   patience, which is no other thing than fortitude of mind in bearing
   evils. But Paul means, that while by enduring we conquer evils, we
   experience how much God's help avails in necessities; for then the
   truth of God is as it were in reality manifested to us. Hence it comes
   that we dare to entertain more hope as to futurity; for the truth of
   God, known by experience, is more fully believed by us. Hence Paul
   teaches that by such a probation, that is, by such an experience of
   divine grace, hope is produced, not that hope then only begins, but
   that it increases and is confirmed. But both mean, that tribulation is
   the means by which patience is produced.

   Moreover, the minds of men are not so formed by nature, that affliction
   of itself produces patience in them. But Paul and Peter regard not so
   much the nature of men as the providence of God through which it comes,
   that the faithful learn patience from troubles; for the ungodly are
   thereby more and more provoked to madness, as the example of Pharaoh
   proves. [99]

   4 But let patience have her perfect work. As boldness and courage often
   appear in us and soon fail, he therefore requires perseverance. "Real
   patience," he says, "is that which endures to the end." For work here
   means the effort not only to overcome in one contest, but to persevere
   through life. His perfection may also he referred to the sincerity of
   the soul, that men ought willingly and not feignedly to submit to God;
   but as the word work is added, I prefer to explain it of constancy. For
   there are many, as we have said, who shew at first an heroic greatness,
   and shortly after grow weary and faint. He therefore bids those who
   would be perfect and entire, [100] to persevere to the end. But what he
   means by these two words, he afterwards explains of those who fail not,
   or become not wearied: for they, who being overcome as to patience, be
   broken down, must, by degrees, be necessarily weakened, and at length
   wholly fail.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [98] The salutation is peculiar; but in the same form with the letter
   sent to Antioch by the Apostles, (of whom James was one,) and the
   church at Jerusalem, Acts 15:23. It is therefore apostolic, although
   adopted from a form commonly used by the heathen writers. See Acts
   23:26. John in John 2:10 and John 2:11 uses the verb chairein in a
   similar sense; and it means properly to rejoice. It being an
   infinitive, the verb lego, to say or to bid, is put before it by John,
   and is evidently understood here. Hence the salutation may thus be
   rendered, -- "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
   bids, (or sends, or wishes) joy to the twelve tribes who are in their
   dispersion." There had been an eastern and a western dispersion, the
   first at the Assyrian and Babylonian captivity, and the second during
   the predominancy of the Grecian power, which commenced with Alexander
   the Great. As this epistle was written in Greek, it was no doubt
   intended more especially for those of the latter dispersion. But the
   benefit of the eastern dispersion was soon consulted, as the very first
   version of the New Testament was made into this language, that is, the
   Syriac; and this was done at the beginning of the second century.

   [99] The word used by James is dochimion, trial, the act of testing,
   and by Paul dochime, the result of testing, experience. James speaks of
   probation, and Paul of the experience gained thereby.

   [100] "Perfect, teleioi," fully grown, mature; "entire, holochlezoi,"
   complete, no part wanting. The first refers to the maturity of grace;
   and the second to its completeness, no grace being wanting. They were
   to be like men full grown, and not maimed or mutilated, but having all
   their members complete.

   James 1:5-8

   5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
   liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

   5 Porro si quis autem vestrum destituitur sapientia, postulet a Deo,
   qui dat omnibus simpliciter, nec exprobrat; et dabitur ei.

   6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is
   like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

   6 Postulet autem in fide, nihil haesitans; nam qui haesitat similis est
   fluctui maris, qui a vento agitur et circumfertur.

   7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the
   Lord.

   7 non ergo existimet homo ille quod sit quicquam accepturus a Domino.

   8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

   8 Vir duplici animo, instabilis est in omnibus viis suis.


   5 If any of you lack wisdom. As our reason, and all our feelings are
   averse to the thought that we can be happy in the midst of evils, he
   bids us to ask of the Lord to give us wisdom. For wisdom here, I
   confine to the subject of the passage, as though he had said, "If this
   doctrine is higher than what your minds can reach to, ask of the Lord
   to illuminate you by his Spirit; for as this consolation alone is
   sufficient to mitigate all the bitterness of evils, that what is
   grievous to the flesh is salutary to us; so we must necessarily be
   overcome with impatience, except we be sustained by this kind of
   comfort." Since we see that the Lord does not so require from us what
   is above our strength, but that he is ready to help us, provided we
   ask, let us, therefore, learn, whenever he commands anything, to ask
   from him the power to perform it.

   Though in this place to be wise is to submit to God in the endurance of
   evils, under a due conviction that he so orders all things as to
   promote our salvation; yet the sentence may be generally applied to
   every branch of right knowledge.

   But why does he say If any one, as though all of them did not want
   wisdom. To this I answer, that all are by nature without it; but that
   some are gifted with the spirit of wisdom, while others are without it.
   As, then, all had not made such progress as to rejoice in affliction,
   but few there were to whom this had been given, James, therefore,
   referred to such cases; and he reminded those who were not as yet fully
   convinced that by the cross their salvation was promoted by the Lord,
   that they were to ask to be endued with wisdom. And yet there is no
   doubt, but that necessity reminds us all to ask the same thing; for he
   who has made the greatest progress, is yet far off from the goal. But
   to ask an increase of wisdom is another thing than to ask for it at
   first.

   When he bids us to ask of the Lord, he intimates, that he alone can
   heal our diseases and relieve our wants.

   That giveth to all men liberally. By all, he means those who ask; for
   they who seek no remedy for their wants, deserve to pine away in them.
   However, this universal declaration, by which every one of us is
   invited to ask, without exception, is very important; hence no man
   ought to deprive himself of so great a privilege.

   To the same purpose is the promise which immediately follows; for as by
   this command he shews what is the duty of every one, so he affirms that
   they would not do in vain what he commands; according to what is said
   by Christ,

   "Knock, and it shall be opened."
   (Matthew 7:7; Luke 11:9.)

   The word liberally, or freely, denotes promptitude in giving. So Paul,
   in Romans 12:8, requires simplicity in deacons. And in 2 Corinthians 8
   and 2 Corinthians 9, when speaking of charity or love, he repeats the
   same word several times. The meaning, then, is, that God is so inclined
   and ready to give, that he rejects none, or haughtily puts them off,
   being not like the niggardly and grasping, who either sparingly, as
   with a closed hand, give but little, or give only a part of what they
   were about to give, or long debate with themselves whether to give or
   not. [101]

   And upbraideth not. This is added, lest any one should fear to come too
   often to God. Those who are the most liberal among men, when any one
   asks often to be helped, mention their formal acts of kindness, and
   thus excuse themselves for the future. Hence, a mortal man, however
   open-handed he may be, we are ashamed to weary by asking too often. But
   James reminds us, that there is nothing like this in God; for he is
   ready ever to add new blessings to former ones, without any end or
   limitation.

   6 But let him ask in faith. He shews here, first the right way of
   praying; for as we cannot pray without the word, as it were, leading
   the way, so we must believe before we pray; for we testify by prayer,
   that we hope to obtain from God the grace which he has promised. Thus
   every one who has no faith in the promises, prays dissemblingly. Hence,
   also, we learn what is true faith; for James, after having bidden us to
   ask in faith, adds this explanation, nothing wavering, or, doubting
   nothing. Then faith is that which relies on God's promises, and makes
   us sure of obtaining what we ask. It hence follows, that it is
   connected with confidence and certainty as to God's love towards us.
   The verb diakrinesthai, which he uses, means properly to inquire into
   both sides of a question, after the manner of pleaders. He would have
   us then to be so convinced of what God has once promised, as not to
   admit a doubt whether he shall be heard or not.

   He that wavereth, or doubteth. By this similitude he strikingly
   expresses how God punishes the unbelief of those who doubt his
   promises; for, by their own restlessness, they torment themselves
   inwardly; for there is never any calmness for our souls, except they
   recumb on the truth of God. He, at length, concludes, that such are
   unworthy to receive anything from God.

   This is a remarkable passage, fitted to disprove that impious dogma
   which is counted as an oracle under the whole Papacy, that is, that we
   ought to pray doubtingly, and with uncertainty as to our success. This
   principle, then, we hold, that our prayers are not heard by the Lord,
   except when we have a confidence that we shall obtain. It cannot indeed
   be otherwise, but that through the infirmity of our flesh we must be
   tossed by various temptations, which are like engines employed to shake
   our confidence; so that no one is found who does not vacillate and
   tremble according to the feeling of his flesh; but temptations of this
   kind are at length to be overcome by faith. The case is the same as
   with a tree, which has struck firm roots; it shakes, indeed, through
   the blowing of the wind, but is not rooted up; on the contrary, it
   remains firm in its own place.

   8 A double-minded man, or, a man of a double mind. This sentence may be
   read by itself, as he speaks generally of hypocrites. It seems,
   however, to me to be rather the conclusion of the preceding doctrine;
   and thus there is an implied contrast between the simplicity or
   liberality of God, mentioned before, and the double-mindedness of man;
   for as God gives to us with a stretched out hand, so it behooves us in
   our turn to open the bosom of our heart. He then says that the
   unbelieving, who have tortuous recesses, are unstable; because they are
   never firm or fixed, but at one time they swell with the confidence of
   the flesh, at another they sink into the depth of despair. [102]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [101] The literal meaning of haplos is simply without any mixture; the
   noun, haplotes, is used in the sense of sincerity, which has no mixture
   of hypocrisy or fraud, (2 Corinthians 1:12.) and in the sense of
   liberality, or disposition free from what is sordid or parsimonious,
   having no mixture of niggardliness, (2 Corinthians 8:2.) This latter is
   evidently the meaning here, so that "liberally," according to our
   version, is the best word.

   [102] "The double-minded," or the man with two souls, dipsuchos, means
   here no doubt the man who hesitates between faith and unbelief, because
   faith is the subject of the passage. When again used, in James 4:8, it
   means a hesitation between God and the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 1:9-11

   9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:

   9 Porro glorietur frater humilis in sublimate sua;

   10 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the
   grass he shall pass away.

   10 Dives autem in humilitate sua, quia tanquam flos herbae
   prateteribit.

   11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth
   the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion
   of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.

   11 Nam sol exortus est cum aestu, et exarescit herba, et flos ejus
   cecidit, et decor aspectus ejus periit; sic et dives in suis viis (vel,
   copiis) marcescet.


   9 Let the brother of low degree. As Paul, exhorting servants
   submissively to bear their lot, sets before them this consolation, that
   they were the free-men of God, having been set free by his grace from
   the most miserable bondage of Satan, and reminds them, though free, yet
   to remember that they were the servants of God; so here James in the
   same manner bids the lowly to glory in this, that they had been adopted
   by the Lord as his children; and the rich, because they had been
   brought down into the same condition, the world's vanity having been
   made evident to them. Thus the first thing he would have to do is to be
   content with their humble and low state; and he forbids the rich to be
   proud. Since it is incomparably the greatest dignity to be introduced
   into the company of angels, nay, to be made the associates of Christ,
   he who estimates this favor of God aright, will regard all other things
   as worthless. Then neither poverty, nor contempt, nor nakedness, nor
   famine nor thirst, will make his mind so anxious, but that he will
   sustain himself with this consolation. "Since the Lord has conferred on
   me the principal thing, it behooves me patiently to bear the loss of
   other things, which are inferior."

   Behold, how a lowly brother ought to glory in his elevation or
   exaltation; for if he be accepted of God, he has sufficient consolation
   in his adoption alone, so as not to grieve unduly for a less prosperous
   state of life.

   10 But the rich, in that he is made low, or, in his lowness. He has
   mentioned the particular for the general; for this admonition pertains
   to all those who excel in honor; or in dignity, or in any other
   external thing. He bids them to glory in their lowness or littleness,
   in order to repress the haughtiness of those who are usually inflated
   with prosperity. But he calls it lowness, because the manifested
   kingdom of God ought to lead us to despise the world, as we know that
   all the things we previously greatly admired, are either nothing or
   very little things. For Christ, who is not a teacher except of babes,
   checks by his doctrine all the haughtiness of the flesh. Lest, then,
   the vain joy of the world should captivate the rich, they ought to
   habituate themselves to glory in the casting down of their carnal
   excellency. [103]

   As the flower of the grass. Were any one to say that James alludes to
   the words of Isaiah, I would not much object; but I cannot allow that
   he quotes the testimony of the Prophet, who speaks not only of the
   things of this life and the fading character of the world, but of the
   whole man, both body and soul; [Isaiah 40:6-8;] but here what is spoken
   of is the pomp of wealth or of riches. And the meaning is, that
   glorying in riches is foolish and preposterous, because they pass away
   in a moment. The philosophers teach the same thing; but the song is
   sung to the deaf, until the ears are opened by the Lord to hear the
   truth concerning the eternity of the celestial kingdom. Hence he
   mentions brother; intimating that there is no place for this truth,
   until we are admitted into the order of God's children.

   Though the received reading is en tais poreiais, yet I agree with
   Erasmus, and read the last word, poriais, without the diphthong "in his
   riches," or, with his riches; and the latter I prefer. [104]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [103] The opinion of Macknight and some others, that the reference is
   to the lowness to which the rich were reduced by persecution, does not
   comport with the passage, for the Apostle afterwards speaks of the
   shortness of man's life and its uncertainty, and not of the fading
   nature of riches, which would have been most suitable, had he in view
   to comfort the rich at the loss of property. The Christian state was
   "lowness" according to the estimation of the world.

   [104] The received text is regarded as the best reading; the other is
   found in very few copies.

   James 1:12-15

   12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried,
   he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to
   them that love him.

   12 Beatus vir qui suffert temptationem; quod quum probatus fuerit,
   accipiet coronam vitae, quam promisit Deus diligentibus ipsum.

   13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God
   cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:

   13 Nemo quum tentatur dicat, a Deo tentor; Deus enim nec tentari malis
   potest, nec quenquam tentat.

   14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and
   enticed.

   14 Sed unusquisque tentatur, dum a sua concupiscentia abstrahitur, et
   inescatur.

   15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when
   it is finished, bringeth forth death.

   15 Postquam antum concupiscentia conceperit, parit peccatum vero
   perfectum generat mortem.


   12 Blessed is the man. After having applied consolation, he moderated
   the sorrow of those who were severely handled in this world, and again
   humbled the arrogance of the great. He now draws this conclusion, that
   they are happy who magnanimously endure troubles and other trials, so
   as to rise above them. The word temptation may indeed be otherwise
   understood, even for the stings of lusts which annoy the soul within;
   but which is here commended, as I think, is fortitude of mind in
   enduring adversities. It is, however, a paradox, that they are not
   happy to whom all things come according to their wishes, but such as
   are not overcome with evils.

   For when he is tried. He gives a reason for the preceding sentence; for
   the crown follows the contest. If, then, it be our chief happiness to
   be crowned in the kingdom of God, it follows, that the contests with
   which the Lord tries us, are aids and helps to our happiness. Thus the
   argument is from the end or the effect: hence we conclude, that the
   faithful are harassed by so many evils for this purpose, that their
   piety and obedience may be made manifest, and that they may be thus at
   length prepared to receive the crown of life.

   But they reason absurdly who hence infer that we by fighting merit the
   crown; for since God has gratuitously appointed it for us, our fighting
   only renders us fit to receive it.

   He adds, that it is promised to those who love God. By speaking thus,
   he means not that the love of man is the cause of obtaining the crown,
   (for God anticipates us by his gratuitous love;) but he only intimates
   that the elect who love him are alone approved by God. He then reminds
   us that the conquerors of all temptations are those who love God, and
   that we fail not in courage when we are tried, for no other cause than
   because the love of the world prevails in us.

   13 Let no man, when he is tempted. Here, no doubt, he speaks of another
   kind of temptation. It is abundantly evident that the external
   temptations, hitherto mentioned, are sent to us by God. In this way God
   tempted Abraham, (Genesis 22:1,) and daily tempts us, that is, he tries
   us as to what are we by laying before us an occasion by which our
   hearts are made known. But to draw out what is hid in our hearts is a
   far different thing from inwardly alluring our hearts by wicked lusts.

   He then treats here of inward temptations which are nothing else than
   the inordinate desires which entice to sin. He justly denies that God
   is the author of these, because they flow from the corruption of our
   nature.

   This warning is very necessary, for nothing is more common among men
   than to transfer to another the blame of the evils they commit; and
   they then especially seem to free themselves, when they ascribe it to
   God himself. This kind of evasion we constantly imitate, delivered down
   to us as it is from the first man. For this reason James calls us to
   confess our own guilt, and not to implicate God, as though he compelled
   us to sin.

   But the whole doctrine of scripture seems to be inconsistent with this
   passage; for it teaches us that men are blinded by God, are given up to
   a reprobate mind, and delivered over to filthy and shameful lusts. To
   this I answer, that probably James was induced to deny that we are
   tempted by God by this reason, because the ungodly, in order to form an
   excuse, armed themselves with testimonies of Scripture. But there are
   two things to be noticed here: when Scripture ascribes blindness or
   hardness of heart to God, it does not assign to him the beginning of
   this blindness, nor does it make him the author of sin, so as to
   ascribe to him the blame: and on these two things only does James
   dwell.

   Scripture asserts that the reprobate are delivered up to depraved
   lusts; but is it because the Lord depraves or corrupts their hearts? By
   no means; for their hearts are subjected to depraved lusts, because
   they are already corrupt and vicious. But since God blinds or hardens,
   is he not the author or minister of evil? Nay, but in this manner he
   punishes sins, and renders a just reward to the ungodly, who have
   refused to be ruled by his Spirit. (Romans 1:26.) It hence follows that
   the origin of sin is not in God, and no blame can be imputed to him as
   though he took pleasure in evils. (Genesis 6:6.)

   The meaning is, that man in vain evades, who attempts to cast the blame
   of his vices on God, because every evil proceeds from no other fountain
   than from the wicked lust of man. And the fact really is, that we are
   not otherwise led astray, except that every one has his own inclination
   as his leader and impeller. But that God tempts no one, he proves by
   this, because he is not tempted with evils [105] For it is the devil
   who allures us to sin, and for this reason, because he wholly burns
   with the mad lust of sinning. But God does not desire what is evil: he
   is not, therefore, the author of doing evil in us.

   14 When he is drawn away by his own lust. As the inclination and
   excitement to sin are inward, in vain does the sinner seek an cause
   from an external impulse. At the same time these two effects of lust
   ought to be noticed -- that it ensnares us by its allurements, and that
   it does us away; each of which is sufficient to render us guilty. [106]

   15 Then when lust hath conceived. He first calls that lust which is not
   any kind of evil affection or desire, but that which is the fountain of
   all evil affections; by which, as he shews, are conceived vicious
   broods, which at length break forth into sins. It seems, however,
   improper, and not according to the usage of Scripture, to restrict the
   word sin to outward works, as though indeed lust itself were not a sin,
   and as though corrupt desires, remaining closed up within and
   suppressed, were not so many sins. But as the use of a word is various,
   there is nothing unreasonable if it be taken here, as in many other
   places, for actual sin.

   And the Papists ignorantly lay hold on this passage, and seek to prove
   from it that vicious, yea, filthy, wicked, and the most abominable
   lusts are not sins, provided there is no assent; for James does not
   shew when sin begins to be born, so as to be sin, and so accounted by
   God, but when it breaks forth. For he proceeds gradually and shews that
   the consummation of sin is eternal death, and that sin arises from
   depraved desires, and that these depraved desires or affections have
   their root in lust. It hence follows that men gather fruit in eternal
   perdition, and fruit which they have procured for themselves.

   By perfected sin, therefore, I understand, not any one act of sin
   perpetrated, but the completed course of sinning. For though death is
   merited by every sin whatever, yet it is said to be the reward of an
   ungodly and wicked life. Hence is the dotage of those confuted who
   conclude from these words, that sin is not mortal until it breaks
   forth, as they say, into an external act. Nor is this what James treats
   of; but his object was only this, to teach that there is in us the root
   of our own destruction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [105] Literally, "untemptable by evils," that is, not capable of being
   tempted or seduced by evils, by things wicked and sinful. He is so
   pure, that he is not influenced by any evil propensities, that he is
   not subject to any evil suggestions. It hence follows that he tempts or
   seduces no man to what is sinful. Being himself unassailable by evils,
   he cannot seduce others to what is evil. As God cannot be tempted to do
   what is sinful, he cannot possibly tempt others to sin. The words may
   thus be rendered, --   13. "Let no one, when seduced, say, By God I am
   seduced;' for God is not capable of being seduced by evils, and he
   himself seduceth no one."

   [106] The words are very striking, -- "But every one is tempted (or,
   seduced) when, by his own lust, he is drawn away, (that is, from what
   is good,) and is caught by a bait (or, ensnared.)" He is in the first
   drawn off from the line of duty, and then he is caught by something
   that is pleasing and plausible, but like the bait, it has in it a
   deadly hook.

   James 1:16-18

   16 Do not err, my beloved brethren.

   16 Ne erretis, fratres mei dilecti:

   17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
   down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither
   shadow of turning.

   17 Omnis donatio bona et omne donum perfectum desursum est, descendens
   a Patre luminum; apud quem non est transmutatio, aut conversionis
   obumbratio.

   18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should
   be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

   18 Is sua voluntate genuit nos veritatis, ut essemus primitiae quaedam
   suaram creaturarum.


   16 Do not err. This is an argument from what is opposite; for as God is
   the author of all good, it is absurd to suppose him to be the author of
   evil. To do good is what properly belongs to him, and according to his
   nature; and from him all good things come to us. Then, whatever evil he
   does, is not agreeable to his nature. But as it sometimes happens, that
   he who quits himself well through life, yet in some things fails, he
   meets this doubt by denying that God is mutable like men. But if God is
   in all things and always like himself, it hence follows that well-doing
   is his perpetual work.

   This reasoning is far different from that of Plato, who maintained that
   no calamities are sent on men by God, because he is good; for though it
   is just that the crimes of men should be punished by God, yet it is not
   right, with regard to him, to regard among evils that punishment which
   he justly inflicts. Plato, indeed, was ignorant; but James, leaving to
   God his right and office of punishing, only removes blame from him.
   This passage teaches us, that we ought to be so affected by God's
   innumerable blessings, which we daily receive from his hand, as to
   think of nothing but of his glory; and that we should abhor whatever
   comes to our mind, or is suggested by others, which is not compatible
   with his praise.

   God is called the Father of lights, as possessing all excellency and
   the highest dignity. And when he immediately adds, that there is in him
   no shadow of turning, he continues the metaphor; so that we may not
   measure the brightness of God by the irradiation of the sun which
   appears to us. [107]

   18 Of his own will. He now brings forward a special proof of the
   goodness of God which he had mentioned, even that he has regenerated us
   unto eternal life. This invaluable benefit every one of the faithful
   feels in himself. Then the goodness of God, when known by experience,
   ought to remove from them all a contrary opinion respecting him.

   When he says that God of his own will, or spontaneously, hath begotten
   us, he intimates that he was induced by no other reason, as the will
   and counsel of God are often set in opposition to the merits of men.
   What great thing, indeed, would it have been to say that God was not
   constrained to do this? But he impresses something more, that God
   according to his own goodwill hath begotten us, and has been thus a
   cause to himself. It hence follows that it is natural to God to do
   good.

   But this passage teaches us, that as our election before the foundation
   of the world was gratuitous, so we are illuminated by the grace of God
   alone as to the knowledge of the truth, so that our calling corresponds
   with our election. The Scripture shews that we have been gratuitously
   adopted by God before we were born. But James expresses here something
   more, that we obtain the right of adoption, because God does also call
   us gratuitously. (Ephesians 1:4, 5.) Farther, we hence learn, that it
   is the peculiar office of God spiritually to regenerate us; for that
   the same thing is sometimes ascribed to the ministers of the gospel,
   means no other thing than this, that God acts through them; and it
   happens indeed through them, but he nevertheless alone doeth the work.

   The word begotten means that we become new men, so that we put off our
   former nature when we are effectually called by God. He adds how God
   begets us, even by the word of truth, so that we may know that we
   cannot enter the kingdom of God by any other door.

   That we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. The word
   tina, "some," has the meaning of likeness, as though he had said, that
   we are in a manner firstfruits. But this ought not to be restricted to
   a few of the faithful; but it belongs to all in common. For as man
   excels among all creatures, so the Lord elects some from the whole mass
   and separates them as a holy offering, to himself. [108] It is no
   common nobility into which God extols his own children. Then justly are
   they said to be excellent as firstfruits, when God's image is renewed
   in them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [107] This verse must be taken in connection with what as gone before.
   When he mentions "every good gift," it is in opposition to the evil of
   which he says God is not the author. See Matthew 7:11. And "every
   perfect free-gift," as dorema means, has a reference to the correction
   of the evil which arises from man himself. And he calls free-gift
   perfect, because it has no mixture of evil, what he throughout denies
   that God is the author of. Then the latter part of the verse bears a
   correspondence with the first. He calls God "the Father of Lights."
   Light in the language of scripture means especially two things, the
   light of truth, divine knowledge and holiness. God is the father, the
   parent, the origin, the source of these lights. Hence from him descends
   every good, useful, necessary gift, to deliver men from evil, from
   ignorance and delusion, and every perfect free-gift to free men from
   their evil lusts, and to render them holy and happy. And to shew that
   God is ever the same, he adds, "with whom there is no variableness or
   the shadow (or shade, of the slightest appearance) of a change;" that
   is, who never varies in his dealings with men, and shews no symptom of
   any change, being the author and giver of all good, and the author of
   no evil, that is, of no sin.

   [108] The firstfruits being a part and a pledge of the coming harvest,
   to retain the metaphor, we must regard "creatures" here as including
   all the saved in future ages. Hence their opinion is to be preferred,
   who regard the first converts, who were Jews, as the firstfruits.

   James 1:19-21

   19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow
   to speak, slow to wrath:

   19 Itaque, fratres mei dilecti, sit omnis homo celer ad audiendum,
   tardus autem ad loquendum, tardus ad iram:

   20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

   20 Ira enim hominus justitiam Dei non operatur.

   21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness,
   and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save
   your souls.

   21 Quapropter deposita omni inmunditie, et redundantia malitiae, cum
   mansuetudine suscipite insitum sermonem qui potest servare animas
   vestras.


   19 Let every man. Were this a general sentence, the inference would be
   farfetched; but as he immediately adds a sentence respecting the word
   of truth suitable to the last verse, I doubt not but that he
   accommodates this exhortation peculiarly to the subject in hand. Having
   then set before us the goodness of God, he shews how it becomes us to
   be prepared to receive the blessing which he exhibits towards us. And
   this doctrine is very useful, for spiritual generation is not a work of
   one moment. Since some remnants of the old man ever abide in us, we
   must necessarily be through life renewed, until the flesh be abolished;
   for either our perverseness, or arrogance, or sloth, is a great
   impediment to God in perfecting in us his work. Hence, when James would
   have us to be swift to hear, he commends promptitude, as though he had
   said, "When God so freely and kindly presents himself to you, you also
   ought to render yourselves teachable, lest your slowness should cause
   him to desist from speaking."

   But inasmuch as we do not calmly hear God speaking to us, when we seem
   to ourselves to be very wise, but by our haste interrupt him when
   addressing us, the Apostle requires us to be silent, to be slow to
   speak. And, doubtless, no one can be a true disciple of God, except he
   hears him in silence. He does not, however, require the silence of the
   Pythagorean school, so that it should not be right to inquire whenever
   we desire to learn what is necessary to be known; but he would only
   have us to correct and restrain our forwardness, that we may not, as it
   commonly happens, unseasonably interrupt God, and that as long as he
   opens his sacred mouth, we may open to him our hearts and our ears, and
   not prevent him to speak.

   Slow to wrath. Wrath also, I think, is condemned with regard to the
   hearing which God demands to be given to him, as though making a tumult
   it disturbed and impeded him, for God cannot be heard except when the
   mind is calm and sedate. Hence, he adds, that as long as wrath bears
   rule there is no place for the righteousness of God. In short, except
   the heat of contention be banished, we shall never observe towards God
   that calm silence of which he has just spoken.

   21 Wherefore lay apart. He concludes by saying how the word of life is
   to be received. And first, indeed, he intimates that it cannot be
   rightly received except it be implanted, or strike roots in us. For the
   expression, to receive the implanted word, ought to be thus explained,
   "to receive it, that it may be really implanted." For he alludes to
   seed often sown on and ground, and not received into the moist bosom of
   the earth; or to plants, which being cast on the ground, or laid on
   dead wood, soon wither. He then requires that it should be a living
   implanting, by which the word becomes as it were united with our heart.

   He at the same time shews the way and manner of this reception, even
   with meekness. By this word he means humility and the readiness of a
   mind disposed to learn, such as Isaiah describes when he says,

   "On whom does my Spirit rest, except on the humble and meek?" (Isaiah
   57:15.)

   Hence it is, that so far profit in the school of God, because hardly
   one in a hundred renounces the stubbornness of his own spirit, and
   gently submits to God; but almost all are conceited and refractory. But
   if we desire to be the living plantation of God, we must subdue our
   proud hearts and be humble, and labor to become like lambs, so as to
   suffer ourselves to be ruled and guided by our Shepherd.

   But as men are never thus tamed, so as to have a calm and meek heart,
   except they are purged from depraved affections, so he bids us to lay
   aside uncleanness and redundancy of wickedness. And as James borrowed a
   comparison from agriculture, it was necessary for him to observe this
   order, to begin by rooting up noxious weeds. And since he addressed
   all, we may hence conclude that these are the innate evils of our
   nature, and that they cleave to us all; yea, since he addresses the
   faithful, he shews that we are never wholly cleansed from them in this
   life, but that they are continually sprouting up, and therefore he
   requires that care should be constantly taken to eradicate them. As the
   word of God is especially a holy thing; to be fitted to receive it, we
   must put off the filthy things by which we have been polluted.

   Under the word kakia, he comprehends hypocrisy and obstinacy as well as
   unlawful desires or lusts. Not satisfied with specifying the seat of
   wickedness as being in the soul of man, he teaches us that so abounding
   is the wickedness that dwells there, that it overflows, or that it
   rises up as it were into a heap; and doubtless, whosoever will well
   examine himself will find that there is within him an immense chaos of
   evils. [109]

   Which is able to save. It is a high eulogy on heavenly truth, that we
   obtain through it a sure salvation; and this is added, that we may
   learn to seek and love and magnify the word as a treasure that is
   incomparable. It is then a sharp goad to chastise our idleness, when he
   says that the word which we are wont to hear so negligently, is the
   means of our salvation, though for this purpose the power of saving is
   not ascribed to the word, as if salvation is conveyed by the external
   sound of the word, or as if the office of saving is taken away from God
   and transferred elsewhere; for James speaks of the word which by faith
   penetrates into the hearts of men, and only intimates that God, the
   author of salvation, conveys it by his Gospel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [109] What renders this passage unsatisfactory is the meaning given to
   perisseia, rendered by some "superfluity," and by others "redundancy."
   The verb perisseuo means not only to abound, but also to be a residue,
   to remain, to be a remnant. See Matthew 14:20; Luke 9:17. And its
   derivative perisseuma is used in the sense of a remnant or a remainder,
   Mark 8:8; and this very word is used in the Sept., for ytr which means
   a residue, a remnant, or what remains, Ezekiel 6:8. Let it have this
   meaning here, and the sense will not only be clear, but very striking.
   James was addressing those who were Christians; and he exhorted them to
   throw away every uncleanness and remnant of wickedness, or evil, as the
   word kakia more properly means. See Acts 8:22; 1 Peter 2:16 "Every
   uncleanness," or filthiness, means every kind of uncleanness arising
   from lustful and carnal indulgences; and the "remnant of wickedness,"
   in thought and in deed, most suitably follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 1:22-27

   22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
   own selves.

   22 Estote factores sermones, et non auditores solum, fallentes vos
   ipsos.

   23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto
   a man beholding his natural face in a glass:

   23 Nam si quis auditor est sermones, et non factor, hic similis est
   homini consideranti faciem nativitatis suae in speculo.

   24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
   forgetteth what manner of man he was.

   24 Consideravit enim seipsum, et abiit, et protinus oblitus est qualis
   sit.

   25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
   therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this
   man shall be blessed in his deed.

   25 Qui vero intuitus fuerit in legem perfectam, quae est libertatis, et
   permanserit, hic non auditor obliviosus, sed factor operis, beatus in
   opere suo erit.

   26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his
   tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.

   26 Si quis videtur religiosus esse inter vos, nec refraenat linguam
   suam, sed decipits cor suum, hujus inanus est religio.

   27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
   visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
   himself unspotted from the world.

   27 Religio pura et impolluta coram Deo et Patre, haec est, Visitare
   pupillos et viduas in afflictione ipsorum, inmaculatum servare se a
   mundo.


   22 Be ye doers of the word. The doer here is not the same as in Romans
   2:13, who satisfied the law of God and fulfilled it in every part, but
   the doer is he who from the heart embraces God's word and testifies by
   his life that he really believes, according to the saying of Christ,

   "Blessed are they who hear God's word and keep it,"
   (Luke 11:28;)

   for he shews by the fruits what that implanting is, before mentioned.
   We must further observe, that faith with all its works is included by
   James, yea, faith especially, as it is the chief work which God
   requires from us. The import of the whole is, that we ought to labor
   that the word of the Lord should strike root in us, so that it may
   afterwards fructify. [110]

   23 He is like to a man. Heavenly doctrine is indeed a mirror in which
   God presents himself to our view; but so that we may be transformed
   unto his image, as Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3:18. But here he speaks
   of the external glance of the eye, not of the vivid and efficacious
   meditation which penetrates into the heart. It is a striking
   comparison, by which he briefly intimates, that a doctrine merely heard
   and not received inwardly into the heart avails nothing, because it
   soon vanishes away.

   25 The perfect law of liberty. After having spoken of empty
   speculation, he comes now to that penetrating intuition which
   transforms us to the image of God. And as he had to do with the Jews,
   he takes the word law, familiarly known to them, as including the whole
   truth of God.

   But why he calls it a perfect law, and a law of liberty, interpreters
   have not been able to understand; for they have not perceived that
   there is here a contrast, which may be gathered from other passages of
   Scripture. As long as the law is preached by the external voice of man,
   and not inscribed by the finger and Spirit of God on the heart, it is
   but a dead letter, and as it were a lifeless thing. It is, then, no
   wonder that the law is deemed imperfect, and that it is the law of
   bondage; for as Paul teaches in Galatians 4:24, separated from Christ,
   it generates to condemn and as the same shews to us in Romans 8:13, it
   can do nothing but fill us with diffidence and fear. But the Spirit of
   regeneration, who inscribes it on our inward parts, brings also the
   grace of adoption. It is, then, the same as though James had said, "The
   teaching of the law, let it no longer lead you to bondage, but, on the
   contrary, bring you to liberty; let it no longer be only a
   schoolmaster, but bring you to perfection: it ought to be received by
   you with sincere affection, so that you may lead a godly and a holy
   life."

   Moreover, since it is a blessing of the Old Testament that the law of
   God should reform us, as it appears from Jeremiah 31:33, and other
   passages, it follows that it cannot be obtained until we come to
   Christ. And, doubtless, he alone is the end and perfection of the law;
   and James adds liberty, as an inseparable associate, because the Spirit
   of Christ never regenerates but that he becomes also a witness and an
   earnest of our divine adoption, so as to free our hearts from fear and
   trembling.

   And continueth. This is firmly to persevere in the knowledge of God;
   and when he adds, this man shall be blessed in his deed, or work, he
   means that blessedness is to be found in doing, not in cold hearing.
   [111]

   26 Seem to be religious. He now reproves even in those who boasted that
   they were doers of the law, a vice under which hypocrites commonly
   labor, that is, the wantonness of the tongue in detraction. He has
   before touched on the duty of restraining the tongue, but for a
   different end; for he then bade silence before God, that we might be
   more fitted to learn. He speaks now of another thing, that the faithful
   should not employ their tongue in evil speaking.

   It was indeed needful that this vice should be condemned, when the
   subject was the keeping of the law; for they who have put off the
   grosser vices, are especially subject to this disease. He who is
   neither an adulterer, nor a thief, nor a drunkard, but, on the
   contrary, seems brilliant with some outward shew of sanctity will set
   himself off by defaming others, and this under the pretense of zeal,
   but really through the lust of slandering.

   The object here, then, was to distinguish between the true worshippers
   of God and hypocrites, who are so swollen with Pharisaic pride, that
   they seek praise from the defects of others. If any one, he says, seems
   to be religious, that is, who has a show of sanctity, and the meantime
   flatters himself by speaking evil of others, it is hence evident that
   he does not truly serve God. For by saying that his religion is vain,
   he not only intimates that other virtues are marred by the stain of
   evil-speaking, but that the conclusion is, that the zeal for religion
   which appears is not sincere.

   But deceiveth his own heart. I do not approve of the version of Erasmus
   -- "But suffers his heart to err;" for he points out the fountain of
   that arrogance to which hypocrites are addicted, through which, being
   blinded by an immoderate love of themselves, they believe themselves to
   be far better than they really are; and hence, no doubt, is the disease
   of slandering, because the wallet, as Aesop says in his Apologue,
   hanging behind, is not seen. Rightly, then, has James, wishing to
   remove the effect, that is, the lust of evil-speaking, added the cause,
   even that hypocrites flatter themselves immoderately. For they would be
   ready to forgive were they in their turn to acknowledge themselves to
   be in need of forgiveness. Hence the flatteries by which they deceive
   themselves as to their own vices, make them such supercilious censors
   of others.

   27 Pure religion. As he passes by those things which are of the
   greatest moment in religion, he does not define generally what religion
   is, but reminds us that religion without the things he mentions is
   nothing; as when one given to wine and gluttony boasts that he is
   temperate, and another should object, and say that the temperate man is
   he who does not indulge in excess as to wine or eating; his object is
   not to express the whole of what temperance is, but to refer only to
   one thing, suitable to the subject in hand. For they are in vain
   religious of whom he speaks, as they are for the most part trifling
   pretenders.

   James then teaches us that religion is not to be estimated by the pomp
   of ceremonies; but that there are important duties to which the
   servants of God ought to attend.

   To visit in necessity is to extend a helping hand to alleviate such as
   are in distress. And as there are many others whom the Lord bids us to
   succor, in mentioning widows and orphans, he states a part for the
   whole. There is then no doubt but that under one particular thing he
   recommends to us every act of love, as though he had said, "Let him who
   would be deemed religious, prove himself to be such by self denial and
   by mercy and benevolence towards his neighbors."

   And he says, before God, to intimate that it appears in deed otherwise
   to men, who are led astray by external masks, but that we ought to seek
   what pleases him. By God and Father, we are to understand God who is a
   father.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [110] Calvin takes no notice of the last sentence, "deceiving
   yourselves." The participle means deceiving by false reasoning.; it may
   be rendered with Doddridge, "sophistically deceiving yourselves."

   [111] It may be rendered thus, -- "The same shall be blessed in (or by)
   the doing of it," that is, the work. The very doing of the law of
   liberty, of what the gospel prescribes, makes a man blessed or happy.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 2:1-4

   1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of
   glory, with respect of persons.

   1 Fratres mei, ne in acceptionabus personarum fidem habeatis Domini
   Jesu Christi ex opinione, (vel, gloriae.)

   2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in
   goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;

   2 Si enim ingressus fuerit in coetum vestrum vir aureos anulos gestans,
   veste indudus spliendida; ingressus autem fuerit et pauper in sordida
   veste;

   3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say
   unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand
   thou there, or sit here under my footstool:

   3 Et respexeritis in cum qui vestem fert splendidam, et ei dixeritis,
   Tu sede hic honeste, et pauperi dixeritis, Tu sta illic, vel, Sede hic
   sub scabello pedum meorum;

   4 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil
   thoughts?

   4 An non dijudicati eestis in vobisipsis, et facti judices malarum
   cogitationum?


   This reproof seems at first sight to be hard and unreasonable; for it
   is one of the duties of courtesy, not to be neglected, to honor those
   who are elevated in the world. Further, if respect of persons be
   vicious, servants are to be freed from all subjection; for freedom and
   servitude are deemed by Paul as conditions of life. The same must be
   thought of magistrates. But the solution of these questions is not
   difficult, if what James writes is not separated. For he does not
   simply disapprove of honor being paid to the rich, but that this should
   not be done in a way so as to despise or reproach the poor; and this
   will appear more clearly, when he proceeds to speak of the rule of
   love.

   Let us therefore remember that the respect of persons here condemned is
   that by which the rich is so extolled, wrong is done to the poor, which
   also he shews clearly by the context and surely ambitions is that
   honor, and full of vanity, which is shewn to the rich to the contempt
   of the poor. Nor is there a doubt but that ambition reigns and vanity
   also, when the masks of this world are alone in high esteem. We must
   remember this truth, that he is to be counted among the heirs of God's
   kingdom, who disregards the reprobate and honors those who fear God.
   (Psalm 15:4.)

   Here then is the contrary vice condemned, that is, when from respect
   alone to riches, anyone honors the wicked, and as it has been said,
   dishonors the good. If then thou shouldest read thus, "He sins who
   respects the rich," the sentence would be absurd; but if as follows,
   "He sins who honors the rich alone and despises the poor, and treats
   him with contempt," it would be a pious and true doctrine.

   1 Have not the faith, etc., with respect of persons. He means that the
   respect of persons is inconsistent with the faith of Christ, so that
   they cannot be united together, and rightly so; for we are by faith
   united into one body, in which Christ holds the primacy. When therefore
   the pomps of the world become preeminent so as to cover over what
   Christ is, it is evident that faith hath but little vigor.

   In rendering tos doxes, "on account of esteem," (ex opinione,) I have
   followed Erasmus; though the old interpreter cannot be blamed, who has
   rendered it "glory," for the word means both; and it may be fitly
   applied to Christ, and that according to the drift of the passage. For
   so great is the brightness of Christ, that it easily extinguishes all
   the glories of the world, if indeed it irradiates our eyes. It hence
   follows, that Christ is little esteemed by us, when the admiration of
   worldly glory lays hold on us. But the other exposition is also very
   suitable, for when the esteem or value of riches or of honors dazzles
   our eyes, the truth is suppressed, which ought alone to prevail. To sit
   becomingly means to sit honorably.

   4 Are ye not then partial in yourselves? or, are ye not condemned in
   yourselves. This may be read affirmatively as well as interrogatively,
   but the sense would be the same, for he amplifies the fault by this,
   that they took delight and indulged themselves in so great a
   wickedness. If it be read interrogatively, the meaning is, "Does not
   your own conscience hold you convicted, so that you need no other
   judge?" If the affirmative be preferred, it is the same as though he
   had said, "This evil also happens, that ye think not that ye sin, nor
   know that your thoughts are so wicked as they are." [112]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [112] It is commonly admitted to be an interrogatory sentence: "And do
   ye not make a difference among (or, in) yourselves, and become judges,
   having evil thoughts?" literally, "judges of evil thoughts," it being,
   as they say, the genitive case of possession. Or the words may be
   rendered, "and become judges of evil (or, false) reasonings?" or as
   Beza renders the sentence, "and become judges, reasoning falsely,"
   concluding that the rich man was good and the poor man bad. It is said
   by Beza and others, that diakrinomai never means to be judged or
   condemned, but to distinguish, to discriminate, to make a difference,
   and also to contend and to doubt. The difference made here was the
   respect of persons that was shewn, and they made this difference in
   themselves, in their own minds, through the perverse or false thoughts
   or reasonings which they entertained. But it appears that these
   preferences were shewn, not to the members of the Church, but to such
   strangers as might happen to come to their assemblies.

   James 2:5-7

   5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this
   world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to
   them that love him?

   5 Audite, fratres mei dilecti, nonne Deus elegit pauperes mundi hujus
   divites in fide et heredes regni quod promisit iis qui diligunt eum?

   6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw
   you before the judgment seats?

   6 Vos autem contemptui habiustis pauperem: nonne divites tyrnnidem in
   vos exercent et iidem trahunt vos ad tribunalia?

   7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?

   7 Et iidem contumelia afficiunt bonum nomen quod invocatum est super
   vos?


   5 Hearken, my beloved brethren. He proves now by a two-fold argument,
   that they acted preposterously, when for the sake of the rich they
   despised the poor: The first is, that it is unbecoming and disgraceful
   to cast down those whom God exalts, and to treat reproachfully those
   whom he honors. As God honors the poor, then every one who repudiates
   them, reverses the order of God. The other argument is taken from
   common experience; for since the rich are for the most part vexatious
   to the good and innocent, it is very unreasonable to render such a
   reward for the wrongs they do, so that they should be more approved by
   us than the poor, who aid us more than they wrong us. We shall now see
   how he proceeds with these two points.

   Hath not God chosen the poor of this world? Not indeed alone, but he
   wished to begin with them, that he might beat down the pride of the
   rich. This is also what Paul says, that God hath chosen, not many
   noble, not many mighty in the world, but those who are weak, that he
   might make ashamed such as are strong (1 Corinthians 1:25.) In short,
   though God pours forth his grace on the rich in common with the poor,
   yet his will is to prefer these to those, that the mighty might learn
   not to flatter themselves, and that the ignoble and the obscure might
   ascribe in what they are to the mercy of God, and that both might be
   trained up to meekness and humility.

   The rich in faith are not those who abound in the greatness of faith,
   but such as God has enriched with the various gifts of his Spirit,
   which we receive by faith. For, doubtless, since the Lord deals
   bountifully with all, every one becomes partaker of his gifts according
   to the measure of his own faith. If, then, we are empty or needy, that
   proves the deficiency of our faith; for if we only enlarge the bosom of
   faith, God is always ready to fill it.

   He says, that a kingdom is promised to those who love God: not that the
   promise depends on love; but he reminds us that we are called by God
   unto the hope of eternal life, on this condition and to this end, that
   we may love him. Then the end, and not the beginning, is here pointed
   out.

   6 Do not the rich. He seems to instigate them to vengeance by bringing
   forward the unjust rule of the rich, in order that they who were
   unjustly treated, might render like for like: and yet we are everywhere
   bid to do good to those who injure us. But the object of James was
   another; for he only wished to shew that they were without reason or
   judgment who through ambition honored their executioners, and in the
   meantime injured their own friends, at least those from whom they never
   suffered any wrong. For hence appeared more fully their vanity, that
   they were induced by no acts of kindness: they only admired the rich,
   because they were rich; nay, they servilely flattered those whom they
   found, to their own loss, to be unjust and cruel.

   There are, indeed, some of the rich who are just, and meek, and hate
   all unrighteousness; but few of such men are to be found. James, then,
   mentions what for the most part usually happens, and what daily
   experience proves true. For as men commonly exercise their power in
   doing what is wrong, it hence happens, that the more power any one has,
   the worse he is, and the more unjust towards his neighbors. The more
   careful then ought the rich to be, lest they should contract any of the
   contagion which everywhere prevails among those of their own rank.

   7 Worthy, or good name. I doubt not but that he refers here to the name
   of God and of Christ. And he says, by, or, on, the which ye are called;
   not in prayer, as Scripture is wont sometimes to speak, but by
   profession; as the name of a father, in Genesis 48:16, is said to be
   called on his offspring, and in Isaiah 4:1, the name of a husband is
   called on the wife. It is, then, the same as though he had said, "The
   good name in which ye glory, or which ye deem it an honor to be called
   by; but if they proudly calumniate the glory of God, how unworthy are
   they of being honored by Christians!"

   James 2:8-11

   8 If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt
   love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:

   8 Si legem quidem regiam perfectis juxta scripturum, Diliges proximum
   tuum sicut te ipsum, bene facitis. (Leviticus 19:18; Matthew 22:39;
   Mark 12:31; Romans 13:9; Galatians 5:14.)

   9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced
   of the law as transgressors.

   9 Sin personam respicitis, peccatum committis, et redarguimini a lege
   veluti transgressores. (Leviticus 19:15; Deuteronomy 1:17, 19.)

   10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point,
   he is guilty of all.

   10 Quisquis enim totam legem servaverit, offenderit autem in uno,
   factus est omnium reus.

   11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
   Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a
   transgressor of the law.

   11 Nam qui dixit, Ne moecheris, dixit etiam, Ne occidas. Quod si non
   fueris moechatus, occideris tamen, factus es transgressor legis.


   Now follows a plainer declaration; for he expressly points out the
   cause of the last reproof, for they were officiously attentive to the
   rich, not from love, but on the contrary, from a vain desire of
   attaining their favor: And it is in anticipation, by which he obviated
   an excuse on the other side; for they might have objected and said,
   that he ought not to be blamed, who humbly submiteth himself to the
   unworthy. James, indeed, concedes that this is true, but he shews that
   it was falsely pretended by them, because they shewed this submission
   of homage, not from love to their neighbors, but from respect of
   persons.

   In the first clause, then, he acknowledges as right and praiseworthy,
   as the duties of love which we perform towards our neighbors. In the
   second, he denies that the ambitious respect of persons ought to be
   deemed as of this kind, for it widely differs from what the law
   prescribes. And the hinge of this answer turns on the words "neighbor"
   and "respect of persons," as though he had said, "If you pretend that
   there is a sort of love in what you do, this may be easily disproved;
   for God bids us to love our neighbors, and not to shew respect of
   persons." Besides, this word "neighbor" includes all mankind: he, then,
   who says, that a very few, according to his own fancy, ought to be
   honored, and others passed by, does not keep the law of God, but yields
   to the depraved desires of his own heart. God expressly commends to us
   strangers and enemies, and all, even the most contemptible. To this
   doctrine the respect of persons is wholly contrary. Hence, rightly does
   James assert, that respect of persons is inconsistent with love.

   8 If ye fulfill the royal law. The law here I take simply as the rule
   of life; and to fulfill, or perform it, is to keep it with real
   integrity of heart, and as they say, roundly, (rotunde;) and he sets
   such a keeping in opposition to a partial observance of it. It is said,
   indeed, to be a royal law, as it is the royal way, or road; that is,
   plain, straight, and level, which, by implication, is set in opposition
   to sinuous by-paths and windings.

   Allusion however is made, as I think, to servile obedience which they
   rendered to the rich, when they might, by serving in sincerity their
   neighbors, be not only free men, but live as kings.

   When, in the second place, he says, that those who had respect of
   persons were convinced, or reproved by the law, the law is taken
   according to its proper meaning. For since we are bidden by God's
   command to embrace all mortals, every one who, with a few exceptions,
   rejects all the rest, breaks the bond of God, and inverts also his
   order, and is, therefore, rightly called a transgressor of the law.

   10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law. What alone he means is, that
   God will not be honored with exceptions, nor will he allow us to cut
   off from his law what is less pleasing to us. At the first view, this
   sentence seems hard to some, as though the apostle countenanced the
   paradox of the Stoics, which makes all sins equal, and as though he
   asserted that he who offends in one thing ought to be punished equally
   with him whose whole life has been sinful and wicked. But it is evident
   from the context that no such thing entered into his mind.

   For we must always observe the reason anything is said. He denies that
   our neighbors are loved when a part only of them is through ambition
   chosen, and the rest neglected. This he proves, because it is no
   obedience to God, when it is not rendered equally according to his
   command. Then as the rule of God is plain and complete or perfect, so
   we ought to regard completeness; so that none of us should
   presumptuously separate what he has joined together. Let there be,
   therefore, a uniformity, if we desire rightly to obey God. As, for
   instance, were a judge to punish ten thefts, and leave one man
   unpunished, he would betray the obliquity of his mind, for he would
   thus shew himself indignant against men rather than against crimes;
   because what he condemns in one he absolves in another.

   We now, then, understand the design of James, that is, that if we cut
   off from God's law what is less agreeable to us, though in other parts
   we may be obedient, yet we be come guilty of all, because in one
   particular thing we violate the whole law. And though he accommodates
   what is said to the subject in hand, it is yet taken from a general
   principle, -- that God has prescribed to us a rule of life, which it is
   not lawful for us to mutilate. For it is not said of a part of the law,
   "This is the way, walk ye in it;" nor does the law promise a reward
   except to universal obedience.

   Foolish, then, are the schoolmen, who deem partial righteousness, as
   they call it, to be meritorious; for this passage and many others,
   clearly shew that there is no righteousness except in a perfect
   obedience to the law.

   11 For he that said, or he who hath said. This is a proof of the former
   verse; because the Lawgiver is to be considered rather than each
   particular precept apart. The righteousness of God, as an indivisible
   body, is contained in the law. Whosoever, then, transgresses one
   article of the Law, destroys, as far as he can, the righteousness of
   God. Besides, as in one part, so in every part, God's will is to try
   our obedience. Hence a transgressor of the law is every one who offends
   as to any one of its commandments according to this saying,

   "Cursed is he who fulfills not all things."
   (Deuteronomy 27:26.)

   We further see, that the transgressor of the law, and the guilty of
   all, mean the same according to James.

   James 2:12-13

   12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of
   liberty.

   12 Sic loquimini, et sic facite, ut per legem libertatis judicandi.

   13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy;
   and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

   13 Judicium enim sine misericordia ei qui non praestiterit
   misericordiam; et gloriatur misericordia adversus judicium.


   12 So speak ye. Some give this explanation, that as they flattered
   themselves too much, they are summoned to the right tribunal; for men
   absolve themselves according to their own notions, because they
   withdraw themselves from the judgment of the divine law. He then
   reminds them that all deeds and words are there to be accounted for,
   because God will judge the world according to his law. As, however,
   such a declaration might have smitten them with immoderate terror, to
   correct or mitigate what they might have thought severe, he adds, the
   law of liberty. For we know what Paul says,

   "Whosoever are under the law are under a curse."
   (Galatians 3:10.)

   Hence the judgment of the law in itself is condemnation to eternal
   death; but he means by the word liberty, that we are freed from the
   rigor of the law.

   This meaning is not altogether unsuitable, though if one examines more
   minutely what immediately follows, he will see that James meant another
   thing; the sense is as though he had said, "Except ye wish to undergo
   the rigor of the law, ye must be less rigid towards your neighbors; for
   the law of liberty is the same as the mercy of God, which delivers us
   from the curse of the law" And so this verse ought to be read with what
   follows, where he speaks of the duty of bearing with infirmities. And
   doubtless the whole passage thus reads well: "Since none of us can
   stand before God, except we be delivered and freed from the strict
   rigor of the law, we ought so to act, that we may not through too much
   severity exclude the indulgence or mercy of God, of which we all have
   need to the last."

   13 For he shall have judgment. This is an application of the last verse
   to the subject in hand, which confirms altogether the second
   explanation which I have mentioned: for he shews, that since we stand
   through God's mercy alone, we ought to shew that to those whom the Lord
   himself commends to us. It is, indeed, a singular commendation of
   kindness and benevolence, that God promises that he will be merciful to
   us, if we be so to our brethren: not that our mercy, how ever great it
   may be, shewn towards men, merits the mercy of God; but that God would
   have those whom he has adopted, as he is to them a kind and an
   indulgent Father, to bear and exhibit his image on the earth, according
   to the saying of Christ,

   "Be ye merciful, as your heavenly Father is merciful."
   (Matthew 5:7.)

   We must notice, on the other hand, that he could denounce nothing on
   them more severe or more dreadful than the judgment of God. It hence
   follows, that all they are miserable and lost who flee not to the
   asylum of pardon.

   And mercy rejoiceth. As though he had said, "God's mercy alone is that
   which delivers us from the dread and terror of judgment." he takes
   rejoicing or glorying in the sense of being victorious or triumphant;
   for the judgment of condemnation is suspended over the whole world, and
   nothing but mercy can bring relief.

   Hard and forced is the explanation of those who regard mercy as put
   here for the person, for men cannot properly be said to rejoice or
   glory against the judgment of God; but mercy itself in a manner
   triumphs, and alone reigns when the severity of judgment gives way;
   though I do not deny but that hence arises confidence in rejoicing,
   that is, when the faithful know that the wrath of God in a manner
   yields to mercy, so that being relieved by the latter, they are not
   overwhelmed by the former.

   James 2:14-17

   14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith,
   and have not works? can faith save him?

   14 Quid prodest, fratres mei, si fidem dicataliquis se habere, opera
   autem non habeat? nunquid potest fides salvum facere ipsum?

   15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,

   15 Quod si frater aut soror nudi fuerint, et egentes quotidiano victu,

   16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and
   filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful
   to the body; what doth it profit?

   16 Dicat autem aliquis vestrum illis, Abite cum pace, calescite et
   saturamini; non tamen dederitis quae sunt necessaria corpori, quae
   utilitas?

   17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

   17 Sic et fides, si opera non habuerit, mortua est per se.


   14 What doth it profit. He proceeds to commend mercy. And as he had
   threatened that God would be a severe Judge to us, and at the same time
   very dreadful, except we be kind and merciful towards our neighbors,
   and as on the other hand hypocrites objected and said, that faith is
   sufficient to us, in which the salvation of men consists, he now
   condemns this vain boasting. The sum, then, of what is said is, that
   faith without love avails nothing, and that it is therefore wholly
   dead.

   But here a question arises, Can faith be separated from love? It is
   indeed true that the exposition of this passage has produced that
   common distinction of the Sophists, between unformed and formed faith;
   but of such a thing James knew nothing, for it appears from the first
   words, that he speaks of false profession of faith: for he does not
   begin thus, "If any one has faith;" but, "If any says that he has
   faith;" by which he certainly intimates that hypocrites boast of the
   empty name of faith, which really does not belong to them.

   That he calls it then faith, is a concession, as the Rhetoricians say;
   for when we discuss a point, it does no harm, nay, it is sometimes
   expedient, to concede to an adversary what he demands, for as soon as
   the thing itself is known, what is conceded may be easily taken away
   from him. James then, as he was satisfied that it was a false pretext
   by which hypocrites covered themselves, was not disposed to raise a
   dispute about a word or an expression. Let us, however, remember that
   he does not speak according to the impression of his own mind when he
   mentions faith, but that on the contrary he disputes against those who
   made a false pretense as to faith, of which they were wholly destitute.

   Can faith save him? This is the same as though he had said, that we do
   not attain salvation by a frigid and bare knowledge of God, which all
   confess to be most true; for salvation comes to us by faith for this
   reason, because it joins us to God. And this comes not in any other way
   than by being united to the body of Christ, so that, living through his
   Spirit, we are also governed by him. There is no such thing as this in
   the dead image of faith. There is then no wonder that James denies that
   salvation is connected with it. [113]

   15 If a brother, or, For if a brother. He takes an example from what
   was connected with his subject; for he had been exhorting them to
   exercise the duties of love. If any one, on the contrary, boasted that
   he was satisfied with faith without works, he compares this shadowy
   faith to the saying of one who bids a famished man to be filled without
   supplying him with the food of which he is destitute. As, then, he who
   sends away a poor man with words, and offers him no help, treats him
   with mockery, so they who devise for themselves faith without works,
   and without any of the duties of religion, trifle with God. [114]

   17 Is dead, being alone. He says that faith is dead, being by itself,
   that is, when destitute of good works. We hence conclude that it is
   indeed no faith, for when dead, it does not properly retain the name.
   The Sophists plead this expression and say, that some sort of faith is
   found by itself; but this frivolous caviling is easily refuted; for it
   is sufficiently evident that the Apostle reasons from what is
   impossible, as Paul calls an angel anathema, if he attempted to subvert
   the gospel. (Galatians 1:8.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [113] When he says "Can faith save him?" his meaning is "Can the faith
   which he says he has save him?" that is, faith which is dead and
   produces no works; for that is the faith clearly intended here, as it
   appears from what follows. To make the meaning more evident, Macknight
   renders the sentence thus, -- "Can this faith save him?" that is, the
   faith that has not works.

   [114] This is adduced as an illustration: as the saying of a man to the
   naked, "Be ye clothed," when he does nothing, effects no good, is
   wholly useless, so is that faith that produces no works; it being as it
   were dead, it cannot save.

   James 2:18-19

   18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy
   faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.

   18 Quin dicat quispam, Tu fidem habes, et ego opera habeo; ostende mihi
   fidem tuam sine operibus (alias, ex operibus) tuis, et ego tibi ex
   operibus meis ostendam fidem meam.

   19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils
   also believe, and tremble.

   19 Tu credis quod Deus unus est, bene facis; et daemones credunt, ac
   contremiscunt.


   18 Yea, a man may say. Erasmus introduces here two persons as speakers;
   one of whom boasts of faith without works, and the other of works
   without faith; and he thinks that both are at length confuted by the
   Apostle. But this view seems to me too forced. He thinks it strange,
   that this should be said by James, Thou hast faith, who acknowledges no
   faith without works. But in this he is much mistaken, that he does not
   acknowledge an irony in these words. Then alla I take for "nay rather;"
   and tis for "any one;" for the design of James was to expose the
   foolish boasting of those who imagined that they had faith when by
   their life they shewed that they were unbelievers; for he intimates
   that it would be easy for all the godly who led a holy life to strip
   hypocrites of that boasting with which they were inflated. [115]

   Shew me. Though the more received reading is, "by works," yet the old
   Latin is more suitable, and the reading is also found in some Greek
   copies. I therefore hesitated not to adopt it. Then he bids to shew
   faith without works, and thus reasons from what is impossible, to prove
   what does not exist. So he speaks ironically. But if any one prefers
   the other reading, it comes to the same thing, "Shew me by works thy
   faith;" for since it is not an idle thing, it must necessarily be
   proved by works. The meaning then is, "Unless thy faith brings forth
   fruits, I deny that thou hast any faith." [116]

   But it may be asked, whether the outward uprightness of life is a sure
   evidence of faith? For James says, "I will shew thee my faith by my
   works." To this I reply, that the unbelieving sometimes excel in
   specious virtues, and lead an honorable life free from every crime; and
   hence works apparently excellent may exist apart from faith. Nor indeed
   does James maintain that every one who seems good possesses faith. This
   only he means, that faith, without the evidence of good works, is
   vainly pretended, because fruit ever comes from the living root of a
   good tree.

   19 Thou believest that there is one God. From this one sentence it
   appears evident that the whole dispute is not about faith, but of the
   common knowledge of God, which can no more connect man with God, than
   the sight of the sun carry him up to heaven; but it is certain that by
   faith we come nigh to God. Besides, it would be ridiculous were any one
   to say, that the devils have faith; and James prefers them in this
   respect to hypocrites. The devil trembles, he says, at the mention of
   God's name, because when he acknowledges his own judge he is filled
   with the fear of him. He then who despises an acknowledged God is much
   worse.

   Thou doest well, is put down for the purpose of extenuating, as though
   he had said, "It is, forsooth! a great thing to sink down below the
   devils." [117]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [115] I would render the verse thus: "But one may say, Thou hast faith,
   I also have works; shew me thy faith that is without works, and I will
   shew thee my faith by my works." It is the same as though he had said,
   "Thou hast faith only, I have also works in addition to my faith; now,
   prove to me that you have true faith without having works connected
   with it, (which was impossible, hence he is called a vain man,' or
   empty-headed, in James 2:20,) and I will prove my faith by its fruits,
   even good works.

   [116] Griesbach and others regard choris as the true reading,
   countenanced by most MSS., and found in the Syr. and Vulg. This verse
   is a key to the meaning of James: faith is to be proved by works; then
   faith properly justifies and saves, and works prove its genuineness.
   When he says that a man is justified by works, the meaning according to
   this verse is, that a man is proved by his works to be justified, his
   faith thereby being shewn to be a living and not a dead faith. We may
   well be surprised, as Doddridge was, that any, taking a view of this
   whole passage, should ever think that there is any contrariety in what
   is here said to be the teaching of Paul. The doctrine of Paul, that man
   is justified by faith and not by works, that is, by a living faith,
   which works by love, is perfectly consistent with what James says, that
   is, that a man is not justified by a dead faith but by that faith which
   proves its living power by producing good works, or by rendering
   obedience to God. The sum of what James says is, that a dead faith
   cannot save, but a living faith, and that a living faith is a working
   faith -- a doctrine taught by Paul as well as by James.

   [117] The design of alluding to the faith of devils seems to have been
   this, to shew that though a good man may believe and tremble, yet if he
   does not obey God and do good works, he has no true evidence of faith.
   Obedient faith is that which saves, and not merely that which makes us
   tremble. The connection with the preceding verse seems to be as
   follows, -- In the former verse the boaster of mere faith is challenged
   to prove that his faith is right and therefore saving; the challenger
   would prove by his works. Then, in this verse, a test is applied -- the
   very first article of faith is mentioned: "Be it that you believe this,
   yet this faith will not save you: the devils have this faith, and
   instead of being saved they tremble.

   James 2:20-26

   20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?

   20 Vis autem scire, O homo inanis! quod fides absque operibus mortua
   sit?

   21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered
   Isaac his son upon the altar?

   21 Abraham pater noster, nonne ex operibus justificatus est, quum
   filium suum Isaac super altare?

   22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith
   made perfect?

   22 Vides quod fides cooperata fuerit ejus operibus, et ex operibus
   fides perfecta fuerit?

   23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God,
   and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the
   Friend of God.

   23 Atque implenta fuit scriptura, quae dicit, Credidit Abraham Deo, et
   imputatum illi fuit in justitiam, et Amicus Deo vacatus est?

   24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith
   only.

   24 Videtis igitur quod ex operibus justificatur homo, et non ex fide
   solum.

   25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she
   had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?

   25 Similiter et Rahab meretrix, nonne ex operibus justificata est, quum
   excepit nuntios, et alia via ejecit?

   26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works
   is dead also.

   26 Quemadmodum enim corpus sine anima mortuum est, ita et fides sine
   operibus mortua est.


   20 But wilt thou know. We must understand the state of the question,
   for the dispute here is not respecting the cause of justification, but
   only what avails a profession of faith without works, and what opinion
   we are to form of it. Absurdly then do they act who strive to prove by
   this passage that man is justified by works, because James meant no
   such thing, for the proofs which he subjoins refer to this declaration,
   that no faith, or only a dead faith, is without works. No one will ever
   understand what is said, nor judge wisely of words, except he who keeps
   in view the design of the writer.

   21 Was not Abraham. The Sophists lay hold on the word justified, and
   then they cry out as being victorious, that justification is partly by
   works. But we ought to seek out a right interpretation according to the
   general drift of the whole passage. We have already said that James
   does not speak here of the cause of justification, or of the manner how
   men obtain righteousness, and this is plain to every one; but that his
   object was only to shew that good works are always connected with
   faith; and, therefore, since he declares that Abraham was justified by
   works, he is speaking of the proof he gave of his justification.

   When, therefore, the Sophists set up James against Paul, they go astray
   through the ambiguous meaning of a term. When Paul says that we are
   justified by faith, he means no other thing than that by faith we are
   counted righteous before God. But James has quite another thing in
   view, even to shew that he who professes that he has faith, must prove
   the reality of his faith by his works. Doubtless James did not mean to
   teach us here the ground on which our hope of salvation ought to rest;
   and it is this alone that Paul dwells upon. [118]

   That we may not then fall into that false reasoning which has deceived
   the Sophists, we must take notice of the two fold meaning, of the word
   justified. Paul means by it the gratuitous imputation of righteousness
   before the tribunal of God; and James, the manifestation of
   righteousness by the conduct, and that before men, as we may gather
   from the preceding words, "Shew to me thy faith," etc. In this sense we
   fully allow that man is justified by works, as when any one says that a
   man is enriched by the purchase of a large and valuable chest, because
   his riches, before hid, shut up in a chest, were thus made known.

   22 By works was faith made perfect [119] By this he again shews, that
   the question here is not respecting the cause of our salvation, but
   whether works necessarily accompany faith; for in this sense it is said
   to have been perfected by works, because it was not idle. It is said to
   have been perfected by works, not because it received thence its own
   perfection, but because it was thus proved to be true. For the futile
   distinction which the Sophists draw from these words, between formed
   and unformed faith, needs no labored refutation; for the faith of Abram
   was formed and therefore perfected before he sacrificed his son. And
   this work was not as it were the finishing, or last work. Formerly
   things afterwards followed by which Abraham proved the increase of his
   faith. Hence this was not the perfection of his faith, nor did it then
   for the first time put on its form. James then understood no other
   thing, than that the integrity of his faith then appeared, because it
   brought forth that remarkable fruit of obedience.

   23 And the Scripture was fulfilled. They who seek to prove from this
   passage of James that the works of Abraham were imputed for
   righteousness, must necessarily confess that Scripture is perverted by
   him; for however they may turn and twist, they can never make the
   effect to be its own cause. The passage is quoted from Moses. (Genesis
   15:6.) The imputation of righteousness which Moses mentions, preceded
   more than thirty years the work by which they would have Abraham to
   have been justified. Since faith was imputed to Abraham fifteen years
   before the birth of Isaac, this could not surely have been done through
   the work of sacrificing him. I consider that all those are bound fast
   by an indissoluble knot, who imagine that righteousness was imputed to
   Abraham before God, because he sacrificed his son Isaac, who was not
   yet born when the Holy Spirit declared that Abraham was justified. It
   hence necessarily follows that something posterior is pointed out here.

   Why then does James say that it was fulfilled? Even because he intended
   to shew what sort of faith that was which justified Abraham; that is,
   that it was not idle or evanescent, but rendered him obedient to God,
   as also we find in Hebrews 11:8. The conclusion, which is immediately
   added, as it depends on this, has no other meaning. Man is not
   justified by faith alone, that is, by a bare and empty knowledge of
   God; he is justified by works, that is, his righteousness is known and
   proved by its fruits.

   25 Likewise also was not Rahab. It seems strange that he connected
   together those who were so unlike. Why did he not rather choose some
   one from so large a number of illustrious fathers, and join him to
   Abraham? Why did he prefer a harlot to all others? he designedly put
   together two persons so different in their character, in order more
   clearly to shew, that no one, whatever may have been his or her
   condition, nation, or class in society, has ever been counted righteous
   without good works. He had named the patriarch, by far the most eminent
   of all; he now includes under the person of a harlot, all those who,
   being aliens, were joined to the Church. Whosoever, then, seeks to be
   counted righteous, though he may even be among the lowest, must yet
   shew that he is such by good works.

   James, according to his manner of speaking, declares that Rahab was
   justified by works; and the Sophists hence conclude that we obtain
   righteousness by the merits of works. But we deny that the dispute here
   is concerning the mode of obtaining righteousness. We, indeed, allow
   that good works are required for righteousness; we only take away from
   them the power of conferring righteousness, because they cannot stand
   before the tribunal of God. [120]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [118] It is justly observed by Scott, that there is the same difficulty
   in reconciling James with himself as with Paul. And this difficulty at
   once vanishes, when we take a view of the whole passage, and not
   confine ourselves to single expressions.

   [119] The previous sentence is hardly intelligible in our version or in
   Calvin's. "Seest thou how faith wrought (co-operated, by C.) with his
   works?" The verb is sunergeo, which means properly to work together, to
   co-operate; and it means also, as the effect of co-operating, to aid,
   to help. "Seest thou how faith aided him in his works?" Schleusner
   gives this paraphrase, "Thou sees that Abraham was aided by his faith
   to do his remarkable works." Beza's version is, "Thou seest that faith
   was the assistant (administer) of his works." Some give the idea of
   combining to co-operating, "Thou seest that faith co-operated with his
   works," that is, in justification. It has been said, that if this
   combination had been intended, it ought to have been said that works
   co-operated with his faith, as faith, according to the testimony of
   scripture and the nature of things, is the primary and the principal
   thing, and as there can be no good works without faith. But the first
   explanation is the most consonant with the words and with the drift of
   the passage.

   [120] The last verse is left unnoticed, -- James 2:26 "For as the body
   without the spirit is dead, so faith without works (or, having no
   works) is dead." The meaning is not, that works are to faith what the
   spirit is to the body, for that would make works to be the life of
   faith, the reverse of the fact; but the meaning is, that faith having
   no works is like a dead carcass without life.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 3:1-5

   1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the
   greater condemnation.

   1 Nolite plures magistri fieri, fratres mei; scientes quod majus
   judicium sumpturi sumus.

   2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the
   same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.

   2 In multis enim labimur omnes: si quis in sermone non labitur, hic
   perfectus est vir, ut qui posssit fraeno moderari totum etiam corpus.

   3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and
   we turn about their whole body.

   3 Ecce equis fraena in ora injicimus, ut obediant nobis; et totum
   illorum corpus circumagimus:

   4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven
   of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm,
   whithersoever the governor listeth.

   4 Ecce etiam naves, cum tantae sint, et a saevis ventis pulsentur,
   circumagnuntur a minimo gubernaculo, quocunque affectus dirigentis
   voluerit:

   5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.

   5 Ita et lingua pusillum membrum est, et magna jactat.


   1 Be not many masters. The common and almost universal interpretation
   of this passage is, that the Apostle discourages the desire for the
   office of teaching, and for this reason, because it is dangerous, and
   exposes one to a heavier judgment, in case he transgresses: and they
   think that he said, Be not many masters, because there ought to have
   been some. But I take masters not to be those who performed a public
   duty in the Church, but such as took upon them the right of passing
   judgment upon others: for such reprovers sought to be accounted as
   masters of morals. And it has a mode of speaking usual among the Greeks
   as well as Latins, that they were called masters who superciliously
   animadverted on others.

   And that he forbade them to be many, it was done for this reason,
   because many everywhere did thrust in themselves; for it is, as it
   were, an innate disease in mankind to seek reputation by blaming
   others. And, in this respect, a twofold vice prevails -- though few
   excel in wisdom, yet all intrude indiscriminately into the office of
   masters; and then few are influenced by a right feeling, for hypocrisy
   and ambition stimulate them, and not a care for the salvation of their
   brethren. For it is to be observed, that James does not discourage
   those brotherly admonitions, which the Spirit so often and so much
   recommends to us, but that immoderate desire to condemn, which proceeds
   from ambition and pride, when any one exalts himself against his
   neighbor, slanders, carps, bites, and malignantly seeks for what he may
   turn to a sinister purpose: for this is usually done when impertinent
   censors of this kind insolently boast themselves in the work of
   exposing the vices of others.

   From this outrage and annoyance James recalls us; and he adds a reason,
   because they who are thus severe towards others shall undergo a heavier
   judgment: for he imposes a hard law on himself, who tries the words and
   deeds of others according to the rule of extreme rigor; nor does he
   deserve pardon, who will pardon none. This truth ought to be carefully
   observed, that they who are too rigid towards their brethren, provoke
   against themselves the severity of God.

   2 For in many things we offend all. This may be taken as having been
   said by way of concession, as though he had said, "Be it that thou
   findest what is blamable in thy brethren, for no one is free from sins;
   but dost thou think that thou art perfect who usest a slanderous and
   virulent tongue?" But James seems to me to exhort us by this argument
   to meekness, since we are ourselves also surrounded with many
   infirmities; for he acts unjustly who denies to others the pardon he
   needs himself. So also Paul says, when he bids the fallen to be
   reproved kindly, and in the spirit of meekness; for he immediately
   adds,

   "considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."
   (Galatians 6:1.)

   For there is nothing which serves more to moderate extreme rigor than
   the knowledge of our own infirmity.

   If any man offend not in word. After having said that there is no one
   who does not sin in many things, he now shews that the disease of
   evil-speaking is more odious than other sins; for by saying that he who
   offends not with his tongue is perfect, he intimates that the
   restraining of the tongue is a great virtue, and one of the chief
   virtues. Hence they act most perversely who curiously examine every
   fault, even the least, and yet so grossly indulge themselves.

   He then indirectly touches here on the hypocrisy of censors, because in
   examining themselves they omitted the chief thing, and that was of
   great moment even their evil-speaking; for they who reproved others
   pretended a zeal for perfect holiness, but they ought to have begun
   with the tongue, if they wished to be perfect. As they made no account
   of bridling the tongue, but, on the contrary, did bite and tear others,
   they exhibited only a fictitious sanctity. It is hence evident that
   they were the most reprehensible of all, because they neglected a
   primary virtue. This connection renders the meaning of the Apostle
   plain to us.

   3 We put bits in the horses' mouths. By these two comparisons he proves
   that a great part of true perfection is in the tongue, and that it
   exercises dominion, as he has just said, over the whole life. He
   compares the tongue, first, to a bridle, and then to a helm of a ship.
   Though a horse be a ferocious animal, yet he is turned about at the
   will of its rider, because he is bridled; no less can the tongue serve
   to govern man. So also with regard to the helm of a ship, which guides
   a large vessel and surmounts the impetuosity of winds. Though the
   tongue be a small member, yet it avails much in regulating the life of
   man.

   And boasteth great things. The verb megalauchein means to boast one's
   self, or to vaunt. But James in this passage did not intend to reprove
   ostentation so much as to show that the tongue is the doer of great
   things; for in this last clause he applies the previous comparisons to
   his subject; and vain boasting is not suitable to the bridle and the
   helm. He then means that the tongue is endued with great power.

   I have rendered what Erasmus has translated the impetuosity, the
   inclination, of the pilot or guide; for horme means desire. I indeed
   allow that among the Greeks it designates those lusts which are not
   subservient to reason. But here James simply speaks of the will of the
   pilot.
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 3:5-6

   5 -- Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!

   5 Ecce exiguus ignis quantam sylvam incendit.

   6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among
   our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the
   course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.

   6 Et lingua ignis est, et mundus iniquitatis: sic inquam lingua
   constituta est in membris nostris, inquinans totum corpus, inflammans
   rotam nativitatis, et inflammatur a gehenna.


   He now explains the evils which proceed from the neglect of restraining
   the tongue, in order that we may know that the tongue may do much good
   or much evil, -- that if it be modest and well regulated, it becomes a
   bridle to the whole life, but that if it be petulant and violent, like
   a fire it destroys all things.

   He represents it as a small or little fire, to intimate that this
   smallness of the tongue will not be a hindrance that its power should
   not extend far and wide to do harm.

   6. By adding that it is a world of iniquity, it is the same as though
   he had called it the sea or the abyss. And he suitably connects the
   smallness of the tongue with the vastness of the world; according to
   this meaning, A slender portion of flesh contains in it the whole world
   of iniquity.

   So is the tongue. He explains what he meant by the term world, even
   because the contagion of the tongue spreads through every part of life;
   or rather he shews what he understood by the metaphor fire, even that
   the tongue pollutes the whole man. He however immediately returns to
   the fire, and says, that the whole course of nature is set on fire by
   the tongue. And he compares human life to a course or a wheel: and
   genesis, as before, he takes for nature, (James 1:23.)

   The meaning is, that when other vices are corrected by age or by the
   succession of time, or when at least then do not possess the whole man,
   the vice of the tongue spreads and prevails over every part of life;
   except one prefers to take setting on fire as signifying a violent
   impulse, for we call that fervid which is accompanied with violence.
   And thus Horace speaks of wheels, for he calls chariots in battle
   fervid, on account of their rapidity. The meaning then would be, that
   the tongue is like untamed horses; for as these draw violently the
   chariots, so the tongue hurries a man headlong by its own wantonness.
   [121]

   When he says that it is set on fire by hell, it is the same as though
   he had said, that the outrageousness of the tongue is the flame of the
   infernal fire. [122] For as heathen poets imagined that the wicked are
   tormented by the torches of the Furies; so it is true, that Satan by
   the fans of temptations kindles the fire of all evils in the world: but
   James means, that fire, sent by Satan, is most easily caught by the
   tongue, so that it immediately burns; in short, that it is a material
   fitted for receiving or fostering and increasing the fire of hell.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [121] "The course of nature," or the compass of nature, that is, all
   that is included in nature, means evidently the same with "the whole
   body" in the preceding clause. There is no sense, compatible with the
   passage, in what some have suggested, "the whole course of life;" for
   what idea is conveyed, when we say that the tongue inflames or sets in
   a flame the whole course of life? But there is an intelligible meaning,
   when it is said, that the tongue sets in a flame the whole machinery of
   our nature, every faculty that belongs to man.

   [122] "A bad tongue is the organ of the devil." -- Estius.
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 3:7-12

   7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of
   things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:

   7 Omnis enim natura ferarum et volucrum et serpentium et marinorum, a
   natura humana domatur et dimota est:

   8 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly
   poison.

   8 Linguam vero nullus hominum domare potest, incoercibile malum, plena
   veneno mortifero.

   9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men,
   which are made after the similitude of God.

   9 Per ipsam benedicimus Deum et Patrem; et per ipsam execramur homines
   ad similitudinem ejus factos.

   10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren,
   these things ought not so to be.

   10 Ex eodem ore procedit benedictio et maledictio. Non onvenit, fratres
   mei, haec ita fieri.

   11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?

   11 An fons ex codem foramine ejicit dulce et amarum?

   12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine,
   figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.

   12 Non potest, fratres mei, ficus oleas proferre; aut vitis ficus; sic
   nullus fons salsam et dulcem gignere aquam.


   7 For every kind of beasts. This is a confirmation of the last clause;
   for that Satan by the tongue rules most effectively he proves by this
   -- that it can by no means be brought to due order; and he amplifies
   this by comparisons. For he says that there is no animal so savage or
   fierce, which is not tamed by the skill of man, -- that fishes, which
   in a manner inhabit another world, -- that birds, which are so quick
   and roving -- and that serpents, which are so inimical to mankind, are
   sometimes tamed. Since then the tongue cannot be restrained, there must
   be some secret fire of hell hidden in it.

   What he says of wild beasts, of serpents, and of other animals, is not
   to be understood of them all; it is enough that the skill of man should
   subdue and tame some of the most ferocious of them, and also that
   serpents are sometimes tamed. He refers to present and to past time:
   the present regards power and capacity, and the past, usage or
   experience. He hence justly concludes that the tongue is full of deadly
   poison.

   Though all these things most suitably refer in the first place to the
   subject of this passage -- that they claim an unreasonable command over
   others, who labor under a worse vice; yet a universal doctrine may be
   understood as taught here, -- that if we desire to form our life
   aright, we must especially strive to restrain the tongue, for no part
   of man does more harm.

   9 Therewith, or, by it, bless we God. It is a clear instance of its
   deadly poison, that it can thus through a monstrous levity transform
   itself; for when it pretends to bless God, it immediately curses him in
   his own image, even by cursing men. For since God ought to be blessed
   in all his works, he ought to be so especially as to men, in whom his
   image and glory peculiarly shine forth. It is then a hypocrisy not to
   be borne, when man employs the same tongue in blessing God and in
   cursing men. There can be then no calling on God, and his praises must
   necessarily cease, when evil-speaking prevails; for it is impious
   profanation of God's name, which the tongue is virulent towards our
   brethren and pretends to praise him. That he may therefore rightly
   praise God, the view of evil speaking as to our neighbor must
   especially be corrected.

   This particular truth ought also to be borne in mind, that severe
   censors discover their own virulence, which they suddenly vomit forth
   against their brethren whatever curses they can imagine, after having
   in sweet strains offered praises to God. Were any one to object and
   say, that the image of God in human nature has been blotted out by the
   sin of Adam; we must, indeed, confess that it has been miserably
   deformed, but in such a way that some of its lineaments still appear.
   Righteousness and rectitude, and the freedom of choosing what is good,
   have been lost; but many excellent endowments, by which we excel the
   brutes, still remain. He, then, who truly worships and honors God, will
   be afraid to speak slanderously of man.

   11 Doth a fountain. He adduces these comparisons in order to shew that
   a cursing tongue is something monstrous, contrary to all nature, and
   subverts the order everywhere established by God. For God hath so
   arranged things which are contrary, that inanimate things ought to
   deter us from a chaotic mixture, sure as is found in a double tongue.

   James 3:13-18

   13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew
   out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.

   13 Quis sapiens et intelligens inter vos? ostendat ex honesta
   conversatione opera sua in mansuetudine sapientiae.

   14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not,
   and lie not against the truth.

   14 Si vero aemulationem amaraem habetis, et contentionem in corde
   vestro, ne gloriemini, et mentiamini adversus veritatem.

   15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
   devilish.

   15 Non est haec sapientia de sursum veniens, sed terrestris, animalis,
   daemonica.

   16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil
   work.

   16 Ubi enim aemulatio et contentio, ibi perturbatio et omne pravum
   opus.

   17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,
   gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,
   without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

   17 Quae autem e sursum est sapientia, primum pura est, deinde pacata,
   aequa, comis, plena misericordiae et bonorum operum, sine
   disquisitione, sine simulatione.

   18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make
   peace.

   18 Fructus autem justitiae in pace seminatur facientibus pacem.


   13 Who is a wise man. As the lust of slandering arises mostly from
   pride, and as the false conceit of wisdom for the most part generates
   pride, he therefore speaks here of wisdom. It is usual with hypocrites
   to exalt and shew off themselves by criminating all others, as the case
   was formerly with many of the philosophers, who sought glory for
   themselves by a bitter abuse of all other orders. Such haughtiness as
   slanderous men swell with and are blinded by, James checked, by denying
   that the conceit of wisdom, with which men flatter themselves, has in
   it anything divine; but, on the contrary, he declares that it proceeds
   from the devil.

   Then the meaning is, that supercilious censors, who largely indulge
   themselves, and at the same time spare none, seem to themselves to be
   very wise, but are greatly mistaken; for the Lord teaches his people
   far otherwise, even to be meek, and to be courteous to others. They,
   then, are alone wise in the sight of God, who connect this meekness
   with an honest conversation; for they who are severe and inexorable,
   though they may excel others in many virtues, do not yet follow the
   right way of wisdom. [124]

   l4 But if ye have bitter envying. He points out the fruits which
   proceed from that extreme austerity which is contrary to meekness; for
   immoderate rigor necessarily begets mischievous emulations, which
   presently break forth into contentions. It is, indeed, an improper mode
   of speaking, to place contentions in the heart; but this affects not
   the meaning; for the object was to shew that the evil disposition of
   the heart is the fountain of these evils.

   He has called envying, or emulation, bitter; for it prevails not,
   except when minds are so infected with the poison of malignity, that
   they turn all things into bitterness. [125]

   That we may then really glory that we are the children of God, he bids
   us to act calmly and meekly towards our brethren; otherwise he declares
   that we are lying in assuming the Christian name. But it is not without
   reason that he has added the associate of envying, even strife, or
   contention, for contests and quarrels ever arise from malignity and
   envy.

   15 This wisdom descendeth not. As hypocrites with difficulty give way,
   he sharply checked their haughtiness, denying that to be true wisdom
   with which they were inflated, while they were extremely morose in
   searching out the vices of others. Conceding to them, however, the term
   wisdom, he shews by the words he applies to it its true character, and
   says that it is earthly, sensual, devilish, or demoniac, while true
   wisdom must be heavenly, spiritual, divine; which three things are
   directly contrary to the three preceding ones. For James takes it as
   granted, that we are not wise, except when we are illuminated by God
   from above through his Spirit. However, then, the mind of man may
   enlarge itself, all its acuteness will be vanity; and not only so, but
   being at length entangled in the wiles of Satan, it will become wholly
   delirious. [126]

   Sensual, or animal, is in opposition to what is spiritual, as in 1
   Corinthians 2:14, where Paul says that the sensual or animal man
   receives not the things of God. And the pride of man could not have
   been more effectually cast down, than when thus is condemned whatever
   wisdom he has from himself, without the Spirit of God; nay, when from
   himself a transition is made to the devil. For it is the same as though
   he had said, that men, following their own sense, or minds, or
   feelings, soon became a prey to the delusions of Satan.

   16 For where envying is. It is an argument from what is contrary; for
   envying, by which hypocrites are influenced, produces effects contrary
   to wisdom. For wisdom requires a state of mind that is calm and
   composed, but envying disturbs it, so that in itself it becomes in a
   manner tumultuous, and boils up immoderately against others.

   Some render akatastasia inconstancy, and sometimes it means this, but
   as it signifies also sedition and tumult, perturbation seems the most
   suitable to this passage. For James meant to express something more
   than levity, even that the malignant and the slanderer does everything
   confusedly and rashly, as though he were beside himself; and hence he
   adds, every evil work

   17 But the wisdom which is from above. He now mentions the effects of
   celestial wisdom which are wholly contrary to the former effects. He
   says first that it is pure; by which term he excludes hypocrisy and
   ambition. [127] He, in the second place, calls it peaceable, to
   intimate that it is not contentious. In the third place, he calls it
   kind or humane, that we may know that it is far away from that
   immoderate austerity which tolerates nothing in our brethren. He also
   calls it gentle or tractable; by which he means that it widely differs
   from pride and malignity. In the last place, he says that it is full of
   mercy, etc., while hypocrisy is inhuman and inexorable. By good fruits
   he generally refers to all those duties which benevolent men perform
   towards their brethren; as though he had said, it is full of
   benevolence. It hence follows, that they lie who glory in their cruel
   austerity.

   But though he had sufficiently condemned hypocrisy, when he said that
   wisdom is pure or sincere; he makes it more clear by repeating the same
   thing at the end. We are hence reminded, that for no other reason are
   we beyond measure morose or austere, but this, because we too much
   spare ourselves, and connive at our own vices.

   But what he says, without discerning (sine dijudicatione,) seems
   strange; for the Spirit of God does not take away the difference
   between good and evil; nor does he render us so senseless as to be so
   void of judgment as to praise vice, and regard it as virtue. To this I
   reply, that James here, by discerning or distinguishing refers to that
   overanxious and overscrupulous inquiry, such as is commonly carried on
   by hypocrites, who too minutely examine the sayings and doings of their
   brethren, and put on them the worst construction. [128]

   18 And the fruit of righteousness. This admits of two meanings, -- that
   fruit is sown by the peaceable, which afterwards they gather, -- or,
   that they themselves, though they meekly tolerate many things in their
   neighbors, do not yet cease to sow righteousness. It is, however, an
   anticipation of an objection; for they who are carried away to evil
   speaking by the lust of slandering, have always this excuse, "What! can
   we then remove evil by our courteousness?" Hence James says, that those
   who are wise according to God's will, are so kind, meek, and merciful,
   as yet not to cover vices nor favor them; but on the contrary in such a
   way as to strive to correct them, and yet in a peaceable manner, that
   is, in moderation, so that union is preserved. And thus he testifies
   that what he had hitherto said tends in no degree to do away with calm
   reproofs; but that those who wish to be physicians to heal vices ought
   not to be executioners.

   He therefore adds, by those who make peace; which ought to be thus
   explained: they who study peace, are nevertheless careful to sow
   righteousness; nor are they slothful or negligent in promoting and
   encouraging good works; but they moderate their zeal with the condiment
   of peace, while hypocrites throw all things into confusion by a blind
   and furious violence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [124] "Who is wise and intelligent among you?" let him by a good
   conduct shew his works in meekness of wisdom." The arrangement here is
   according to what is common in scripture: Wisdom the effect first, then
   knowledge the cause or what precedes it. In what follows the order is
   reversed; knowledge distinguishes between good and bad works, and the
   good ought to be exhibited with that meekness which wisdom dictates.

   [125] A similar order as to the words is found here as in the former
   verse: bitter envying is occasioned by strife of contention. There may
   be envying without contention, but it is contention that commonly makes
   it bitter.

   [126] Scott considers that this wisdom was called "earthly," because it
   sought earthly distinctions, and was of earthly origin, -- "sensual,"
   or rather "natural," as the word is rendered in 1 Corinthians 2:14,
   because it was the result of such principles as natural men are
   actuated by, such as envy and ambition, -- "and devilish," because it
   came first from the devil, and constituted the image of his pride,
   ambition, malignity, and falsehood. The word "sensual" has led some to
   suppose that the reference is to sensuality, the gratification of
   carnal lusts: but there is nothing in the passage that favors this
   view. The only things mentioned are envy and a contentious spirit,
   things which belong to natural man.

   [127] "Pure," hagne, is to be understood according to what the context
   contains. It means what is free from taint or pollution: the kind of
   taint must be learnt from the passage. The wisdom from above is
   contrasted with the wisdom from below: the latter has envy and
   contention; the former is "pure," being free from envy, and is
   "peaceable."

   [128] The word adiukritos is found only here, and has been variously
   rendered, because the verb from which it comes has various meanings, --
   to discern, to make a difference, to judge, to examine, to contend or
   litigate, and to doubt. It is rendered by the Vulg., as "not judging"
   -- uncensorious; by Beza, "without contending" -- incontroversial; by
   Erasmus, "making no difference" -- impartial; and by Hammond, "not
   doubting," i.e., as to the faith. "Uncensorious," or, "impartial;"
   seems the most suitable rendering; not given to rashness in judging of
   others, or not shewing respect of persons, previously condemned in
   James 2:1. Then follows "undissembling," not saying one thing and
   meaning another. There seems to be a complete contrast between the two
   kinds of wisdom. The wisdom from above is not envious, but pure; is not
   contentious, but peaceable; does not create confusion, but is patient
   and conciliatory; and instead of producing "every evil work," it is
   full of mercy or benevolence, and of the fruits of benevolence, being
   not censorious or partial in judgment, and not dissembling, or acting
   dishonestly. By this comparison, we see what were some of the things
   included in "every evil work;" they were the reverse of mercy or
   benevolence, and its fruits, even censoriousness or partiality, and
   dissimilation. And yet those who exhibited all those evil things
   thought that they had wisdom! and even gloried in it!

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 4:1-3

   1 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence,
   even of your lusts that war in your members?

   1 Unde bella et pugnae inter vos? nonne hinc, ex voluptatibus vestris,
   quae militant in membris vestris.

   2 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot
   obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.

   2 Concupiscitis et non habetis; invidetis et aemulamini, et non
   potestis obtinere; pugnatis et belligeramini, non habetis, propterea
   quod non petitis;

   3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it
   upon your lusts.

   3 Petitis, et non accipitis, quia male petitis, ut in voluptates
   vestras insumatis.


   1 From whence come wars. As he had spoken of peace, and had reminded
   them that vices are to be exterminated in such a way as to preserve
   peace, he now comes to their contentions, by which they created
   confusion among themselves; and he shews that these arose from their
   invidious desires and lusts, rather than from a zeal for what was just
   and right; for if every one observed moderation, they would not have
   disturbed and annoyed one another. They had their hot conflicts,
   because their lusts were allowed to prevail unchecked.

   It hence appears, that greater peace would have been among them, had
   every one abstained from doing wrong to others; but the vices which
   prevailed among them were so many attendants armed to excite
   contentions. He calls our faculties members. He takes lusts as
   designating all illicit and lustful desires or propensities which
   cannot be satisfied without doing injury to others.

   2 Ye lust, or covet, and have not. He seems to intimate that the soul
   of man is insatiable, when he indulges wicked lusts; and truly it is
   so; for he who suffers his sinful propensities to rule uncontrolled,
   will know no end to his lust. Were even the world given to him, he
   would wish other worlds to be created for him. It thus happens, that
   men seek torments which exceed the cruelty of all executioners. For
   that saying of Horace is true:

   The tyrants of Sicily found no torment greater than envy. [129]

   Some copies have phoneuete, "ye kill;" but I doubt not but that we
   ought to read, phthoneite, "ye envy," as I have rendered it; for the
   verb, to kill, does in no way suit the context. [130] Ye fight: he does
   not mean those wars and fightings, which men engage in with drawn
   swords, but the violent contentions which prevailed among them. They
   derived no benefit from contentions of this kind, for he affirms that
   they received the punishment of their own wickedness. God, indeed, whom
   they owned not as the author of blessings, justly disappointed them.
   For when they contended in ways so unlawful, they sought to be enriched
   through the favor of Satan rather than through the favor of God. One by
   fraud, another by violence, one by calumnies, and all by some evil or
   wicked arts, strove for happiness. They then sought to be happy, but
   not through God. It was therefore no wonder that they were frustrated
   in their efforts, since no success can be expected except through the
   blessings of God alone.

   3 Ye seek and receive not. He goes farther: though they sought, yet
   they were deservedly denied; because they wished to make God the
   minister of their own lusts. For they set no bounds to their wishes, as
   he had commanded; but gave unbridled license to themselves, so as to
   ask those things of which man, conscious of what is right, ought
   especially to be ashamed. Pliny somewhere ridicules this impudence,
   that men so wickedly abuse the ears of God. The less tolerable is such
   a thing in Christians, who have had the rule of prayer given them by
   their heavenly Master.

   And doubtless there appears to be in us no reverence for God, no fear
   of him, in short, no regard for him, when we dare to ask of him what
   even our own conscience does not approve. James meant briefly this, --
   that our desires ought to be bridled: and the way of bridling them is
   to subject them to the will of God. And he also teaches us, that what
   we in moderation wish, we ought to seek from God himself; which if it
   be done, we shall be preserved from wicked contentions, from fraud and
   violence, and from doing any injury to others.

   [129] Invidia Siculi non invenere tyranni Majus tormentum. -- EPIST.
   Lib. I. 2:58.

   [130] There is no MS. nor version in favor of phthoneite. When it is
   said, "ye kill," the meaning is, that they did so as to the hatred or
   envy they entertained, for hatred is the root of murder, and arises
   often from envy. What has evidently led Calvin and others to conjecture
   a mistake here, has been the difficulty arising from the order of the
   words, "Ye kill and ye envy;" but this order is wholly consonant with
   the style of Scripture, where often the greater evil or good is
   mentioned first, and then that which precedes or leads to it. It is the
   same here as though the copulative, and, were rendered causatively, "ye
   kill because ye envy." Envy is murder in the sight of God. The language
   of the whole passage is highly metaphorical. He calls their contentions
   "wars and fightings;" for the whole tenor of the passage is opposed to
   the supposition that he refers to actual wars. He adopts a military
   term as to inward lusts or ambitious desires, that they "carried on
   war" in their members; the expedition for their contests was prepared
   within, mustered in their hearts. Then the character of this war is
   more plainly defined, "Ye covet," not, ye lust; "ye kill," or commit
   murder, for "ye envy;" when ye cannot attain your objects, "ye wage war
   and fight," that is, ye wrangle and quarrel. Avarice and ambition were
   the two prevailing evils, but especially avarice; and avarice too for
   the purpose of gratifying the lusts and propensities of their sinful
   nature, as it appears from the third verse.
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 4:4-6

   4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of
   the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of
   the world is the enemy of God.

   4 Adulteri et adulterae, an nescitis quod amicitia mundi inimictia Dei
   est? qui ergo voluerit amicus esse mundi, inimicus Dei constituitur.

   5 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
   dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

   5 An putatis quod frustra dicat scriptura? An ad invidiam concupiscit
   spiritus qui habitat in nobis?

   6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the
   proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

   6 Quin majorem dat gratiam: --


   4 Ye adulterers. I connect this verse with the foregoing verses: for he
   calls them adulterers, as I think, metaphorically; for they corrupted
   themselves with the vanities of this world, and alienated themselves
   from God; as though he had said, that they had become degenerated, or
   were become bastards. We know how frequent, in Holy Scripture, is that
   marriage mentioned which God forms with us. He would have us, then, to
   be like a chaste virgin, as Paul says, (2 Corinthians 11:2.) This
   chastity is violated and corrupted by all impure affections towards the
   world. James, then, does not without reason compare the love of the
   world to adultery.

   They, then, who take his words literally, do not sufficiently observe
   the context: for he goes on still to speak against the lusts of men,
   which lead away those entangled with the world from God, as it follows,
   --

   The friendship of the world. He calls it the friendship of the world
   when men surrender themselves to the corruptions of the world, and
   become slaves to them. For such and so great is the disagreement
   between the world and God, that as much as any one inclines to the
   world, so much he alienates himself from God. Hence the Scripture bids
   us often to renounce the world, if we wish to serve God.

   5 Do ye think. He seems to adduce from Scripture the next following
   sentence. Hence interpreters toil much, because none such, at least
   none exactly alike, is found in Scripture. But nothing hinders the
   reference to be made to what has been already said, that is, that the
   friendship of the world is adverse to God. Moreover; it has been
   rightly said, that this is a truth which occurs everywhere in
   Scripture. And that he has omitted the pronoun, which would have
   rendered the sentence clearer, is not to be wondered at, for, as it is
   evident, he is everywhere very concise.

   The Spirit, or, Does the Spirit? Some think that the soul of man is
   meant, and therefore read the sentence affirmatively, and according to
   this meaning, -- that the spirit of man, as it is malignant, is so
   infected with envy, that it has ever a mixture of it. They, however,
   think better who regard the Spirit of God as intended; for it is he
   that is given to dwell in us. [131] I then take the Spirit as that of
   God, and read the sentence as a question; for it was his object to
   prove, that because they envied they were not ruled by the Spirit of
   God; because he teaches the faithful otherwise; and this he confirms in
   the next verse, by adding that he giveth more grace

   For it is an argument arising from what is contrary. Envy is a proof or
   sign of malignity; but the Spirit of God proves himself to be bountiful
   by the affluence of his blessings. There is then nothing more repugnant
   to his nature than envy. In short, James denies that the Spirit of God
   rules where depraved lusts prevail, which excite to mutual contention;
   because it is peculiarly the office of the Spirit to enrich men more
   and more continually with new gifts.

   I will not stop to refute other explanations. Some give this meaning
   that the Spirit lusteth against envy; which is too harsh and forced.
   Then they say that God gives more grace to conquer and subdue lust. But
   the meaning I have given is more suitable and simple, -- that he
   restores us by his bounty from the power of malignant emulation. The
   continuative particle de is to be taken adversatively, for alla or alla
   ge; so have I rendered it quin, but.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [131] There are wagon-loads of interpretations, says Erasmus, on this
   passage. The one given by Calvin, and adopted by Whitby, Doddridge,
   Scholefield, and others, is the most satisfactory, and what alone
   enables us to see a meaning in the words, "more grace," in the
   following verse. The Spirit dwells in God's people, and he dwells there
   to give more or increasing grace, according to the tenor of what is
   said in Isaiah 57:15, where God is said to "dwell with him that is of a
   contrite and humble spirit," and for this purpose, "to revive the
   spirit of the humble," etc.   5, 6 "Do ye think that the scripture
   speaketh thus in vain? Doth the Spirit who dwells in us lust to envy?
   nay, but he giveth more (or increasing) grace: he therefore saith, God
   sets himself in array against the insolent, but gives grace to the
   humble." The humble are those who are made so by grace; but God
   promises to give them more grace, to perfect that which had begun.
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 4:7-10

   7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will
   flee from you.

   7 Subjecti igitur estote Deo; Resistite diabolo, et fugiet a vobis;

   8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands,
   ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

   8 Appropinquate Deo, et appropinquabit vobis; mundate manus,
   peccatores; purificate corda duplici animo;

   9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to
   mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

   9 Affligimini, lugete et plorate; risus vester in luctum vertatur et
   gaudium in moerorem.

   10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you
   up.

   10 Humiliamini coram Deo, et eriget vos.


   7 Submit yourselves. The submission which he recommends is that of
   humility; for he does not exhort us generally to obey God, but requires
   submission; for the Spirit of God rests on the humble and the meek.
   (Isaiah 57:15.) On this account he uses the illative particle. For as
   he had declared that God's Spirit is bountiful in increasing his gifts,
   he hence concludes that we ought to lay aside envy, and to submit to
   God.

   Many copies have introduced here the following sentence: "Wherefore he
   saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble." But
   in others it is not found. Erasmus suspects that it was first a note in
   the margin, and afterwards crept into the text. It may have been so,
   though it is not unsuitable to the passage. For what some think, that
   it is strange that what is found only in Peter, should be quoted as
   Scripture, may be easily disposed of. But I rather conjecture that this
   sentence which accords with the common doctrine of Scripture, had
   become then a sort of proverbial saying common among the Jews. And,
   indeed, it is no more than what is found in Psalm 18:27,

   "The humble O Lord, thou wilt save;
   and the eyes of the proud wilt thou cast down:"

   and similar sentences are found in many other passages. [132]

   Resist the devil. He shews what that contention is which we ought to
   engage in, as Paul says, that our contest is not with flesh and blood,
   but he stimulates us to a spiritual fight. Then, after having taught us
   meekness towards men, and submission towards God, he brings before us
   Satan as our enemy, whom it behooves us to fight against.

   However, the promise which he adds, respecting the fleeing of Satan,
   seems to be refuted by daily experience; for it is certain, that the
   more strenuously any one resists, the more fiercely he is urged. For
   Satan, in a manner, acts playfully, when he is not in earnest repelled;
   but against those who really resist him, he employs all the strength he
   possesses. And further, he is never wearied with fighting; but when
   conquered in one battle, he immediately engages in another. To this I
   reply, that fleeing is to be taken here for putting to flight, or
   routing. And, doubtless, though he repeats his attacks continually, he
   yet always departs vanquished.

   8 Draw nigh to God. He again reminds us that the aid of God will not be
   wanting to us, provided we give place to him. For when he bids us to
   draw nigh to God, that we may know him to be near to us, he intimates
   that we are destitute of his grace, because we withdraw from him. But
   as God stands on our side, there is no reason to fear succumbing. But
   if any one concludes from this passage, that the first part of the work
   belongs to us, and that afterwards the grace of God follows, the
   Apostle meant no such thing; for though we ought to do this, yet it
   does [not] immediately follow that we can. And the Spirit of God, in
   exhorting us to our duty, derogates nothing from himself, or from his
   own power; but the very thing he bids us to do, he himself fulfills in
   us.

   In short, James meant no other thing in this passage, than that God is
   never wanting to us, except when we alienate ourselves from him. He is
   like one who brings the hungry to a table and the thirsty to a
   fountain. There is this difference, that our steps must be guided and
   sustained by the Lord, for our feet fail us. But what some cavil at,
   and say, that God's grace is secondary to our preparation, and as it
   were the waiting-maid, is only frivolous; for we know that it is no new
   thing that he adds now to former graces and thus enriches more and more
   those to whom he has already given much.

   Cleanse your hands. He here addresses all those who were alienated from
   God and he does not refer to two sorts of men, but he calls the same
   sinners and double-minded Nor does he understand every kind of sinners,
   but the wicked and those of a corrupt life. It is said in John 9:3,

   "God does not hear sinners;"

   in the same sense a woman is called a sinner by Luke. (Luke 7:39.) It
   is said by the same and the other evangelists, "He drinketh and eateth
   with sinners." He, therefore, does not smite all indiscriminately to
   that sort of repentance mentioned here, but those who are wicked and
   corrupt in heart, and whose life is base and flagitious or at least
   wicked; it is from these he requires a purity of heart and outward
   cleanliness.

   We hence learn what is the true character of repentance. It is not only
   an outward amendment of life, but its beginning is the cleansing of the
   heart. It is also necessary on the other hand that the fruits of inward
   repentance should appear in the brightness of our works. [133]

   9 Be afflicted and mourn. Christ denounces mourning on those who laugh,
   as a curse, (Luke 6:25;) and James, in what shortly follows, alluding
   to the same words, threatens the rich with mourning. But here he speaks
   of that salutary mourning or sorrow which leads us to repentance. He
   addresses those who, being inebriated in their minds, did not perceive
   God's judgment. Thus it happened that they flattered themselves in
   their vices. That he might shake off from them this deadly torpor, he
   admonishes them to learn to mourn, that being touched with sorrow of
   conscience they might cease to flatter themselves and to exult on the
   verge of destruction. Then laughter is to be taken as signifying the
   flattering with which the ungodly deceive themselves, while they are
   infatuated by the sweetness of their sins and forget the judgment of
   God.

   10 Humble yourselves, or, be ye humbled. The conclusion of what is gone
   before is, that the grace of God then be ready to raise us up when he
   sees that our proud spirits are laid aside. We emulate and envy,
   because we desire to be eminent. This is a way wholly unreasonable, for
   it is God's peculiar work to raise up the lowly, and especially those
   who willingly humble themselves. Whosoever, then, seeks a firm
   elevation, let him be cast down under a sense of his own infirmity, and
   think humbly of himself. Augustine well observes somewhere, As a tree
   must strike deep roots downwards, that it may grow upwards, so every
   one who has not his soul fixed deep in humility, exalts himself to his
   own ruin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [132] The passage is found in all MSS. and versions: there is,
   therefore, no ground to think it an interpolation. And it is taken
   literally from Proverbs 3:34, according to the Sept.; though the first
   clause differs from the Hebrew in words, yet it is substantially the
   same. To "scorn the scorners," and to "resist (or, to stand in array
   against) the proud" or insolent, mean the same thing.

   [133] In the seventh verse he seems still to continue military terms,
   "Set yourselves, therefore, in array under God: stand up against the
   devil, and he will flee from you." It is especially to be observed,
   that the first thing is to be under the banner and protection of God,
   and then we can successfully stand up against the devil: apart from
   God, we have no power to resist him. The order in the following verse,
   the eighth, is worthy of notice, as an example of what is very common
   in Scripture. The main thing is first stated, to draw nigh to God: and
   then the things which are previously necessary, to cleanse their hands
   and to purify their hearts -- an allusion probably to the practice
   among the priests of the law, of washing themselves before they engaged
   in the service of the temple. They were to wash their hands as though
   they had been stained with blood, as the crime of murder had been
   imputed to them in James 4:2: and they were to purify their hearts from
   the covetings and ambitious desires which they had entertained. Except
   those things were done they could not draw nigh to God. And further, to
   draw nigh to God was necessary before they could set themselves in
   array under his authority, so that there is a connection between this
   verse and the former: the ultimate object, stated first, was submission
   to God, and to be under his protection; and all that follows was
   necessary for that purpose. The regular order would be, Purify your
   hearts, cleanse your hands, draw nigh to God, and be subject to him.
   But this mode of statement, by going backward instead of forward, is to
   be met with in all parts of Scripture. See on this subject the
   [12]Preface to the third volume of Calvin's Commentaries on Jeremiah.

   James 4:11-12

   11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of
   his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and
   judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the
   law, but a judge.

   11 Ne detrahatis invicem, fratres; qui detrahit fratri, aut judicat
   fratrem suum, detrahit legi, et judicat legem; si autem judicas legem,
   non es factor legis sed judex.

   12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art
   thou that judgest another?

   12 Unus est legislator, qui potest servare et perdere: tu, quis es qui
   judicas alterum?


   11 Speak not evil, or, defame not. We see how much labor James takes in
   correcting the lust for slandering. For hypocrisy is always
   presumptuous, and we are by nature hypocrites, fondly exalting
   ourselves by calumniating others. There is also another disease innate
   in human nature, that every one would have all others to live according
   to his own will or fancy. This presumption James suitably condemns in
   this passage, that is, because we dare to impose on our brethren our
   rule of life. He then takes detraction as including all the calumnies
   and suspicious works which flow from a malignant and perverted
   judgment. The evil of slandering takes a wide range; but here he
   properly refers to that kind of slandering which I have mentioned, that
   is, when we superciliously determine respecting the deeds and sayings
   of others, as though our own morosity were the law, when we confidently
   condemn whatever does not please us.

   That such presumption is here reproved is evident from the reason that
   is immediately added, He that speaketh evil of, or defames his brother,
   speaketh evil of, or defames the law. He intimates, that so much is
   taken away from the law as one claims of authority over his brethren.
   Detraction, then, against the law is opposed to that reverence with
   which it behooves us to regard it.

   Paul handles nearly the same argument in Romans 14, though on a
   different occasion. For when superstition in the choice of meats
   possessed some, what they thought unlawful for themselves, they
   condemned also in others. He then reminded them, that there is but one
   Lord, according to whose will all must stand or fall, and at whose
   tribunal we must all appear. Hence he concludes that he who judges his
   brethren according to his own view of things, assumes to himself what
   peculiarly belongs to God. But James reproves here those who under the
   pretense of sanctity condemned their brethren, and therefore set up
   their own morosity in the place of the divine law. He, however, employs
   the same reason with Paul, that is, that we act presumptuously when we
   assume authority over our brethren, while the law of God subordinates
   us all to itself without exception. Let us then learn that we are not
   to judge but according to God's law.

   Thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. This sentence ought to be
   thus explained: "When thou claimest for thyself a power to censure
   above the law of God thou exemptest thyself from the duty of obeying
   the law." He then who rashly judges his brother; shakes off the yoke of
   God, for he submits not to the common rule of life. It is then an
   argument from what is contrary; because the keeping of the law is
   wholly different from this arrogance, when men ascribe to their conceit
   the power and authority of the law. It hence follows, that we then only
   keep the law, when we wholly depend on its teaching alone and do not
   otherwise distinguish between good and evil; for all the deeds and
   words of men ought to be regulated by it.

   Were any one to object and say, that still the saints will be the
   judges of the world, (1 Corinthians 6:2,) the answer is obvious, that
   this honor does not belong to them according to their own right, but
   inasmuch as they are the members of Christ; and that they now judge
   according to the law, so that they are not to be deemed judges because
   they only obediently assent to God as their own judge and the judge of
   all. With regard to God he is not to be deemed the doer of the law,
   because his righteousness is prior to the law; for the law has flown
   from the eternal and infinite righteousness of God as a river from its
   fountain.

   12 There is one lawgiver [134] Now he connects the power of saying and
   destroying with the office of a lawgiver, he intimates that the whole
   majesty of God is forcibly assumed by those who claim for themselves
   the right of making a law; and this is what is done by those who impose
   as a law on others their own nod or will. And let us remember that the
   subject here is not civil government, in which the edicts and laws of
   magistrates have place, but the spiritual government of the soul, in
   which the word of God alone ought to bear rule. There is then one God,
   who has consciences subjected by right to his own laws, as he alone has
   in his own hand the power to save and to destroy.

   It hence appears what is to be thought of human precepts, which cast
   the snare of necessity on consciences. Some indeed would have us to
   shew modesty, when we call the Pope antichrist, who exercises tyranny
   over the souls of men, making himself a lawgiver equal to God. But we
   learn from this passage something far more, even that they are the
   members of Antichrist, who willingly submit to be thus ensnared, and
   that they thus renounce Christ, when they connect themselves with a man
   that is not only a mortal, but who also extols himself against him. It
   is, I say, a prevaricating obedience, rendered to the devil, when we
   allow any other than God himself to be a lawgiver to rule our souls.

   Who art thou. Some think that they are admonished here to become
   reprovers of their own vices, in order that they might begin to examine
   themselves, and that by finding out that they were not purer than
   others, they might cease to be so severe. I think that their own
   condition is simply suggested to men, so that they may think how much
   they are below that dignity which they assumed, as Paul also says, "Who
   art thou who judgest another?" (Romans 14:4.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [134] Griesbach adds kai krite^'s, "and judge," a reading favored by
   many MSS. and the versions; and doubtless it makes the passage more
   complete, especially as what follows belongs to the judge rather than
   to the lawgiver, that is, to save or to destroy.

   James 4:13-17

   13 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a
   city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:

   13 Age nunc, qui dicitis, Hodie et cras eamus in civitatem, et
   transigamus illic annum unum, et mercemur et lucremur;

   14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your
   life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then
   vanisheth away.

   14 Qui nescitis quid cras futurum sit; quae enim est vita nostra? vapor
   est scilicet ad exiguum tempus apparens, deinde evanescens:

   15 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do
   this, or that.

   15 Quum dicere debeatis, Si Dominus voluerit, et vixerimus, faciemus
   hoc vel illud.

   16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.

   16 Nunc autem gloriamini in superbiis vestris; omnia gloriatio talis,
   mala est.

   17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him
   it is sin.

   17 Qui ergo novit facere bonum, nec facit, peccati reus est.


   13 Go to now. He condemns here another kind of presumption, that many,
   who ought to have depended on God's providence, confidently settled
   what they were to do, and arranged their plans for a long time, as
   though they had many years at their own disposal, while they were not
   sure, no not even of one moment. Solomon also sharply ridicules this
   kind of foolish boasting, when he says that

   "men settle their ways in their heart,
   and the Lord in the mean time rules the tongue."
   (Proverbs 16:1.)

   And it is a very insane thing to undertake to execute what we cannot
   pronounce with our tongue. James does not reprove the form of speaking,
   but rather the arrogance of mind, that men should forget their own
   weakness, and speak thus presumptuously; for even the godly, who think
   humbly of themselves, and acknowledge that their steps are guided by
   the will of God, may yet sometimes say, without any qualifying clause,
   that they will do this or that. It is indeed right and proper, when we
   promise anything as to future time, to accustom ourselves to such words
   as these, "If it shall please the Lord," "If the Lord will permit." But
   no scruple ought to be entertained, as though it were a sin to omit
   them; for we read everywhere in the Scriptures that the holy servants
   of God spoke unconditionally of future things, when yet they had it as
   a principle fixed in their minds, that they could do nothing without
   the permission of God. Then as to the practice of saying, "If the Lord
   will or permit," it ought to be carefully attended to by all the godly.

   But James roused the stupidity of those who disregarded God's
   providence, and claimed for themselves a whole year, though they had
   not a single moment in their own power; the gain which was afar off
   they promised to themselves, though they had no possession of that
   which was before their feet.

   14 For what is your life? He might have checked this foolish license in
   determining things to come by many other reasons; for we see how the
   Lord daily frustrates those presumptuous men who promise what great
   things they will do. But he was satisfied with this one argument, who
   has promised to thee a life for tomorrow? Canst thou, a dying man, do
   what thou so confidently resolvest to do? For he who remembers the
   shortness of his life, will have his audacity easily checked so as not
   to extend too far his resolves. Nay, for no other reason do ungodly men
   indulge themselves so much, but because they forget that they are men.
   By the similitude of vapor, he strikingly shews that the purposes which
   are founded only on the present life, are altogether evanescent.

   15 If the Lord will. A twofold condition is laid down, "If we shall
   live so long," and, "If the Lord will;" because many things may
   intervene to upset what we may have determined; for we are blind as to
   all future events. [135] By will he means not that which is expressed
   in the law, but God's counsel by which he governs all things.

   16 But now ye rejoice, or, glory. We may learn from these words that
   James condemned something more than a passing speech. Ye rejoice, or,
   glory, he says, in your empty boastings. Though they robbed God of his
   government, they yet flattered themselves; not that they openly set
   themselves up as superior to God, though they were especially inflated
   with confidence in themselves, but that their minds were inebriated
   with vanity so as to disregard God. And as warnings of this kind are
   usually received with contempt by ungodly men -- nay, this answer is
   immediately given, "known to ourselves is what is offered to us, so
   that there is no need of such a warning;" -- he alleges against them
   this knowledge in which they gloried, and declares that they sinned the
   more grievously, because they did not sin through ignorance, but
   through contempt.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [135] The words may be rendered thus, "If the Lord will, we shall both
   live and do this or that." So that living and doing are both dependent
   on God's will.

   CHAPTER 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 5:1-6

   1 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall
   come upon you

   1 Agedum nunc divites, plorate, ululantes super miseriis vestris quae
   advenient vobis.

   2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

   2 Divitiae vestrae putrefactae sunt, vestimenta vestra a tineis excesa
   sunt.

   3 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a
   witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have
   heaped treasure together for the last days.

   3 Aurum et argentum vestrum aerugine corruptum est; et aerugo eorum in
   testimonium vobis erit, et exedet carnes vestras sicut ignis: thesaurum
   congessistis in extremis diebus.

   4 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields,
   which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which
   have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.

   4 Ecce merces operariorum, qui messuerunt regiones vestras, quae fraude
   aversa est a vobis, clamat; et clamores eorum qui messuerunt, in aures
   Domini Sabaoth introierunt.

   5 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have
   nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

   5 In deliciis vixistis super terram; lacivistis, enutristis corda
   vestra, sicut in die mactationis.

   6 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.

   6 Condemnastis et occidistis justum, et non resistit vobis.


   1 Go to now. They are mistaken, as I think, who consider that James
   here exhorts the rich to repentance. It seems to me to be a simple
   denunciation of God's judgment, by which he meant to terrify them
   without giving them any hope of pardon; for all that he says tends only
   to despair. He, therefore, does not address them in order to invite
   them to repentance; but, on the contrary, he has a regard to the
   faithful, that they, hearing of the miserable and of the rich, might
   not envy their fortune, and also that knowing that God would be the
   avenger of the wrongs they suffered, they might with a calm and
   resigned mind bear them. [136]

   But he does not speak of the rich indiscriminately, but of those who,
   being immersed in pleasures and inflated with pride, thought of nothing
   but of the world, and who, like inexhaustible gulfs, devoured
   everything; for they, by their tyranny, oppressed others, as it appears
   from the whole passage.

   Weep and howl, or, Lament, howling. Repentance has indeed its weeping,
   but being mixed with consolation, it does not proceed to howling. Then
   James intimates that the heaviness of God's vengeance will be so
   horrible and severe on the rich, that they will be constrained to break
   forth into howling, as though he had said briefly to them, "Woe to
   you!" But it is a prophetic mode of speaking: the ungodly have the
   punishment which awaits them set before them, and they are represented
   as already enduring it. As, then, they were now flattering themselves,
   and promising to themselves that the prosperity in which they thought
   themselves happy would be perpetual, he declared that the most grievous
   miseries were nigh at hand.

   2 Your riches. The meaning may be twofold: -- that he ridicules their
   foolish confidence, because the riches in which they placed their
   happiness, were wholly fading, yea, that they could be reduced to
   nothing by one blast from God -- or that he condemns as their
   insatiable avarice, because they heaped together wealth only for this,
   that they might perish without any benefit. This latter meaning is the
   most suitable. It is, indeed, true that those rich men are insane who
   glory in things so fading as garments, gold, silver, and such things,
   since it is nothing else than to make their glory subject to rust and
   moths; and well known is that saying "What is ill got is soon lost;"
   because the curse of God consumes it all, for it is not right that the
   ungodly or their heirs should enjoy riches which they have snatched, as
   it were, by violence from the hand of God.

   But as James enumerates the vices of which the rich brought on
   themselves the calamity which he mentions, the context requires, as I
   think, that we should say, that what he condemns here is the extreme
   rapacity of the rich, in retaining everything they could lay hold on,
   that it might rot uselessly in their chests. For thus it was, that what
   God had created for the use of men, they destroyed, as though they were
   the enemies of mankind. [137]

   But it must be observed, that the vices which he mentions here do not
   belong to all the rich; for some of them indulge themselves in luxury,
   some spend much in show and display, and some pinch themselves, and
   live miserably in their own filth. Let us, then, know that he here
   reproves some vices in some, and some vices in others. However, all
   those are generally condemned who unjustly accumulate riches, or who
   foolishly abuse them. But what James now says, is not only suitable to
   the rich of extreme tenacity, (such as Euclio of Plautus,) but to those
   also who delight in pomp and luxury, and yet prefer to heap up riches
   rather than to employ them for necessary purposes. For such is the
   malignity of some, that they grudge to others the common sun and air.

   3 A witness against you. He confirms the explanation I have already
   given. For God has not appointed gold for rust, nor garments for moths;
   but, on the contrary, be has designed them as aids and helps to human
   life. Therefore, even spending without benefit is a witness of
   inhumanity. The rusting of gold and silver will be, as it were, the
   occasion of inflaming the wrath of God, so that it will, like fire,
   consume them.

   Ye have heaped treasure together: These words may also admit of two
   explanations: -- that the rich, as they would always live, are never
   satisfied, but weary themselves in heaping together what may be
   sufficient to the end of the world, -- or, that they heap together the
   wrath and curse of God for the last day; and this second view I
   embrace. [138]

   4 Behold, the hire. He now condemns cruelty, the invariable companion
   of avarice. But he refers only to one kind, which, above all others,
   ought justly to be deemed odious. For if a humane and a just man, as
   Solomon says in Proverbs 12:10, regards the life of his beast, it is a
   monstrous barbarity, when man feels no pity towards the man whose sweat
   he has employed for his own benefit. Hence the Lord has strictly
   forbidden, in the law, the hire of the laborer to sleep with us
   (Deuteronomy 24:15). Besides, James does not refer to laborers in
   common, but, for the sake of amplifying, he mentions husbandmen and
   reapers. For what can be more base than that they, who supply us with
   bread by their labor should be pined through want? And yet this
   monstrous thing is common; for there are many of such a tyrannical
   disposition, that they think that the rest of mankind live only for
   their benefit alone.

   But he says that this hire crieth, for whatever men retain either by
   fraud or by violence, of what belongs to another; it calls for
   vengeance as it were by a loud voice. We ought to notice what he adds,
   that the cries of the poor come to the ears of God, so that we may know
   that the wrong done to them shall not be unpunished. They, therefore,
   who are oppressed by the unjust ought resignedly to sustain their
   evils, because they will have God as their defender. And they who have
   the power of doing wrong ought to abstain from injustice, lest they
   provoke God against them, who is the protector and patron of the poor.
   And for this reason also he calls God the Lord of Sabaoth, or of hosts,
   intimating thereby his power and his might, by which he renders his
   judgment more dreadful.

   5 In pleasure. He comes now to another vice, even luxury and sinful
   gratifications; for they who abound in wealth seldom keep within the
   bounds of moderation, but abuse their abundance by extreme indulgences.
   There are, indeed, some rich men, as I have said, who pine themselves
   in the midst of their abundance. For it was not without reason that the
   poets have imagined Tantalus to be hungry near a table well furnished.
   There have ever been Tantalians in the world. But James, as it has been
   said, does not speak of all rich men. It is enough that we see this
   vice commonly prevailing among the rich, that they are given too much
   to luxuries, to pomps and superfluities.

   And though the Lord allows them to live freely on what they have, yet
   profusion ought to be avoided and frugality practiced. For it was not
   in vain that the Lord by his prophets severely reproved those who slept
   on beds of ivory, who used precious ointments, who delighted themselves
   at their feasts with the sound of the harp, who were like fat cows in
   rich pastures. For all these things have been said for this end, that
   we may know that moderation ought to be observed, and that extravagance
   is displeasing to God.

   Ye have nourished your hearts. He means that they indulged themselves,
   not only as far as to satisfy nature, but as far as their cupidity led
   them. He adds a similitude, as in a day of slaughter, because they were
   wont in their solemn sacrifices to eat more freely than according to
   their daily habits. He then says, that the rich feasted themselves
   every day of their life, because they immersed themselves in perpetual
   indulgences.

   6 Ye have condemned. Here follows another kind of inhumanity, that the
   rich by their power oppressed and destroyed the poor and weak. He says
   by a metaphor that the just were condemned and killed; for when they
   did not kill them by their own hand, or condemn them as judges, they
   yet employed the authority which they had to do wrong, they corrupted
   judgments, and contrived various arts to destroy the innocent, that is,
   really to condemn and kill them. [139]

   By adding that the just did not resist them, he intimates that the
   audacity of the rich was greater; because those whom they oppressed
   were without any protection. He, however, reminds them that the more
   ready and prompt would be the vengeance of God, when the poor have no
   protection from men. But though the just did not resist, because he
   ought to have patiently endured wrongs, I yet think that their weakness
   is at the same time referred to, that is he did not resist, because he
   was unprotected and without any help from men.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [136] Many commentators, such as Grotius, Doddridge, Macknight, and
   Scott, consider that the Apostle refers at the beginning of this
   chapter, not to professing Christians, but to unbelieving Jews. There
   is nothing said that can lead to such an opinion: and if the two
   preceding chapters were addressed (as admitted by all) to those who
   professed the faith, there is no reason why this should not have been
   addressed to them; the sins here condemned are not worse than those
   previously condemned. Indeed, we find by the Epistles of Peter, and by
   that of Jude, that there were men professing religion at that time, who
   were not a whit better (if not worse) than many who profess religion in
   our age. Besides, it was not unusual, in addresses to Christians, to
   address unbelievers. Indeed, Paul expressly says, "What have I to do to
   judge them that are without?" That there were rich men professing the
   gospel at that time, is evident from James 1:10.

   [137] Reference is made here to three sorts of riches, -- stores of
   corn, which rotted, -- garments, which were moth-eaten, -- and precious
   metals, money, and jewels, etc., which rusted.

   [138] By "last days" are commonly meant the days of the gospel. The day
   of judgment is often called by John, in his Gospel, "the last day;" and
   the same seems to be called here "the last days." The reference made by
   some, to the destruction of Jerusalem, has nothing in the passage to
   favor it. To "heap treasure," or to lay up a store, has an evident
   reference to the day of judgment, as Paul makes use of the same
   expression in Romans 2:5, only he adds "wrath" to it, which is also
   added here by the Vulg. The whole verse is conminatory, and in this
   sentence the rich are reminded of the issue, the final issue of their
   conduct. The character of the store is to be learnt from the preceding
   part of the verse. In treasuring dishonest wealth, they were treasuring
   wrath for themselves.

   [139] Many have thought that what is referred to here is the
   condemnation of our Savior by the Jewish nation, especially as he is
   called ho dikaios, "the just one." This is true, but the Christian is
   also called too, in 1 Peter 4:18. James very frequently individualizes
   the faithful, using the singular for the plural number. The whole
   context proves that he speaks here of the poor faithful who suffered
   injustice from the rich, professing the same faith. Besides, the death
   of Christ is not ascribed to the rich, but to the elders and chief
   priests. The two first verbs, being aorists, may be rendered in the
   present tense, especially as the last verb is in that tense. For in the
   very next verse, the 7th, the aorist is so used. We may then give this
   version, --   6. "Ye condemn, ye kill the righteous; he sets himself
   not in array against you." Probably the aorist is used, as it expresses
   what was done habitually, or a continued act, like the future tense
   often in Hebrew. The preceding verse, the 5th, where all the verbs are
   aorists, would be better rendered in the same way, "Ye live in
   pleasure," etc.

   James 5:7-9

   7 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold,
   the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath
   long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.

   7 Patienter ergo agite, fratres, usque in adventum Domini. Ecce
   agricola expectat pretiosum fructum terrae, patienter se gerens erga
   eum, donec recipiat pluvium matutinam et vespertinam.

   8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord
   draweth nigh.

   8 Patienter ergo agite et vos; confirmate corda vestra, quonim adventus
   Domini propinquus est.

   9 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned:
   behold, the judge standeth before the door.

   9 Ne ingemiscatis alii in alios, fratres, ne condemnemeni: ecce judex
   stat pro foribus.


   7 Be patient therefore. From this inference it is evident that what has
   hitherto been said against the rich, pertains to the consolation of
   those who seemed for a time to be exposed to their wrongs with
   impunity. For after having mentioned the causes of those calamities
   which were hanging over the rich, and having stated this among others,
   that they proudly and cruelly ruled over the poor, he immediately adds,
   that we who are unjustly oppressed, have this reason to be patient,
   because God would become the judge. For this is what he means when he
   says, unto the coming of the Lord, that is, that the confusion of
   things which is now seen in the world will not be perpetual, because
   the Lord at his coming will reduce things to order, and that therefore
   our minds ought to entertain good hope; for it is not without reason
   that the restoration of all things is promised to us at that day. And
   though the day of the Lord is everywhere called in the Scriptures a
   manifestation of his judgment and grace, when he succors his people and
   chastises the ungodly, yet I prefer to regard the expression here as
   referring to our final deliverance.

   Behold, the husbandman. Paul briefly refers to the same similitude in 2
   Timothy 2:6, when he says that the husbandman ought to labor before he
   gathers the fruit; but James more fully expresses the idea, for he
   mentions the daily patience of the husbandman, who, after having
   committed the seed to the earth, confidently, or at least patiently,
   waits until the time of harvest comes; nor does he fret because the
   earth does not immediately yield a ripe fruit. He hence concludes, that
   we ought not to be immoderately anxious, if we must now labor and sow,
   until the harvest as it were comes, even the day of the Lord.

   The precious fruit. He calls it precious, because it is the nourishment
   of life and the means of sustaining it. And James intimates, that since
   the husbandman suffers his life, so precious to him, to lie long
   deposited in the bosom of the earth, and calmly suspends his desire to
   gather the fruit, we ought not to be too hasty and fretful, but
   resignedly to wait for the day of our redemption. It is not necessary
   to specify particularly the other parts of the comparison.

   The early and the latter rains. By the two words, early and latter, two
   seasons are pointed out; the first follows soon after sowing; and the
   other when the corn is ripening. So the prophets spoke, when they
   intended to set forth the time for rain, (Deuteronomy 28:12; Joel 2:23;
   Hosea 6:3.) And he has mentioned both times, in order more fully to
   shew that husbandmen are not disheartened by the slow progress of time,
   but bear with the delay.

   8 Stablish your hearts. Lest any should object and say, that the time
   of deliverance was too long delayed, he obviates this objection and
   says, that the Lord was at hand, or (which is the same thing) that his
   coming was drawing nigh. In the meantime, he bids us to correct the
   softness of the heart, which weakens us, so as not to persevere in
   hope. And doubtless the time appears long, because we are too tender
   and delicate. We ought, then, to gather strength that we may become
   hardened and this cannot be better attained than by hope, and as it
   were by a realizing view of the near approach of our Lord.

   9 Grudge not, or, groan not. As the complaints of many were heard, that
   they were more severely treated than others, this passage is so
   explained by some, as though James bade each to be contented with his
   own lot, not to envy others, nor grudge if the condition of others was
   more tolerable. But I take another view; for after having spoken of the
   unhappiness of those who distress good and quiet men by their tyranny,
   he now exhorts the faithful to be just towards one another and ready to
   pass by offenses. That this is the real meaning may be gathered from
   the reason that is added: Be not querulous one against another; lest ye
   be condemned. We may, indeed, groan, when any evil torments us; but he
   means an accusing groan, when one expostulates with the Lord against
   another. And he declares that thus they would all be condemned, because
   there is no one who does not offend his brethren, and afford them an
   occasion of groaning. Now, if everyone complained, they would all have
   accused one another; for no one was so innocent, that he did not do
   some harm to others.

   God will be the common judge of all. What, then, will be the case, but
   that every one who seeks to bring judgment on others, must allow the
   same against himself; and thus all will be given up to the same ruin.
   Let no one, then, ask for vengeance on others, except he wishes to
   bring it on his own head. And lest they should be hasty in making
   complaints of this kind, he declares that the judge was at the door.
   For as our propensity is to profane the name of God, in the slightest
   offenses we appeal to his judgment. Nothing is a fitter bridle to check
   our rashness, than to consider that our imprecations vanish not into
   air, because God's judgment is at hand.

   James 5:10-11

   10 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the
   Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.

   10 Exemplum accipite afflictionis, fratres mei, et tolerentiae,
   prophetas, qui loquuti sunt in nomine Domini.

   11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
   patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is
   very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

   11 Ecce beatos esse ducimus eos qui sustinent: patientiam Job audistis,
   et finem Domini vidistis, quod multum sit misericors et commiserans.


   10 Take, my brethren, the prophets. The comfort which he brings is not
   that which is according to the common proverb, that the miserable hope
   for like companions in evils. That they set before them associates, in
   whose number it was desirable to be classed; and to have the same
   condition with them, was no misery. For as we must necessarily feel
   extreme grief, when any evil happens to us which the children of God
   have never experienced, so it is a singular consolation when we know
   that we suffer nothing different from them; nay, when we know that we
   have to sustain the same yoke with them.

   When Job heard from his friends,

   "Turn to the saints, can you find any like to thee?"
   (Job 5:1,)

   it was the voice of Satan, because he wished to drive him to despair.
   When, on the other hand, the Spirit by the mouth of James designs to
   raise us up to a good hope, he shews to us all the fore-going saints,
   who as it were stretch out their hand to us, and by their example
   encourage us to undergo and to conquer afflictions.

   The life of men is indeed indiscriminately subject to troubles and
   adversities; but James did not bring forward any kind of men for
   examples, for it would have availed nothing to perish with the
   multitude; but he chose the prophets, a fellowship with whom is
   blessed. Nothing so breaks us down and disheartens us as the feeling of
   misery; it is therefore a real consolation to know that those things
   commonly deemed evils are aids and helps to our salvation. This is,
   indeed, what is far from being understood by the flesh; yet the
   faithful ought to be convinced of this, that they are happy when by
   various troubles they are proved by the Lord. To convince us of this,
   James reminds us to consider the end or design of the afflictions
   endured by the prophets; for as our own evils we are without judgment,
   being influenced by grief, sorrow, or some other immoderate feelings,
   as we see nothing under a foggy sky and in the midst of storms, and
   being tossed here and there as it were by a tempest, it is therefore
   necessary for us to cast our eyes to another quarter, where the sky is
   in a manner serene and bright. When the afflictions of the saints are
   related to us, there is no one who will allow that they were miserable,
   but, on the contrary, that they were happy.

   Then James has done well for us; for he has laid before our eyes a
   pattern, that we may learn to look at it whenever we are tempted to
   impatience or to despair: and he takes this principle as granted, that
   the prophets were blessed in their afflictions, for they courageously
   sustained them. Since it was so, he concludes that the same judgment
   ought to be formed of us when afflicted.

   And he says, the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord; by
   which he intimates that they were accepted and approved by God. If,
   then, it had been useful for them to have been free from miseries,
   doubtless God would have kept them free. But it was otherwise. It hence
   follows that afflictions are salutary to the faithful. He, therefore,
   bids them to be taken as an example of suffering affliction. But
   patience also must be added, which is a real evidence of our obedience.
   Hence he has joined them both together.

   11 The patience of Job. Having spoken generally of the prophets, he now
   refers to an example remarkable above others; for no one, as far as we
   can learn from histories, has ever been overwhelmed with troubles so
   hard and so various as Job; and yet he emerged from so deep a gulf.
   Whosoever, then, will imitate his patience, will no doubt find God's
   hand, which at length delivered him, to be the same. We see for what
   end his history has been written. God suffered not his servant Job to
   sink, because he patiently endured his afflictions. Then he will
   disappoint the patience of no one.

   If, however, it be asked, Why does the Apostle so much commend the
   patience of Job, as he had displayed many signs of impatience, being
   carried away by a hasty spirit? To this I reply, that though he
   sometimes failed through the infirmity of the flesh, or murmured within
   himself, yet he ever surrendered himself to God, and was ever willing
   to be restrained and ruled by him. Though, then, his patience was
   somewhat deficient, it is yet deservedly commended.

   The end of the Lord. By these words he intimates that afflictions ought
   ever to be estimated by their end. For at first God seems to be far
   away, and Satan in the meantime revels in the confusion; the flesh
   suggests to us that we are forsaken of God and lost. We ought, then, to
   extend our view farther, for near and around us there appears no light.
   Moreover, he has called it the end of the Lord, because it is his work
   to give a prosperous issue to adversities. If we do our duty in bearing
   evils obediently, he will by no means be wanting in performing his
   part. Hope directs us only to the end; God will then shew himself very
   merciful, how ever rigid and severe he may seem to be while afflicting
   us. [140]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [140] "The end of the Lord" seems a singular expression; but telos,
   properly the end, means also the issue, the upshot, the termination,
   the conclusion. It is genitive of the efficient cause, "the end (or
   issue) given by the Lord." See Job 42:12. According to Griesbach there
   are three MSS which have eleos, "mercy;" which would be very suitable,
   -- "and ye have seen the mercy of the Lord, that the Lord is very full
   of pity, and compassionate." But the authority is not sufficient.

   James 5:12-13

   12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,
   neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be
   yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.

   12 Ante omnia vero, fratres mei, Ne juretis, neque per coelum, neque
   per terram, neque aliud quodvis jusjurandum; sit autem vestrum. Est,
   est; Non, non: ne in judicium (vel, simulationem) incidatis.

   13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing
   psalms.

   13 Afflgitur quis inter vos? oret: hilari est animo? psallat.


   12 But above all things. It has been a common vice almost in all ages,
   to swear lightly and inconsiderately. For so bad is our nature that we
   do not consider what an atrocious crime it is to profane the name of
   God. For though the Lord strictly commands us to reverence his name,
   yet men devise various subterfuges, and think that they can swear with
   impunity. They imagine, then, that there is no evil, provided they do
   not openly mention the name of God; and this is an old gloss. So the
   Jews, when they swore by heaven or earth, thought that they did not
   profane God's name, because they did not mention it. But while men seek
   to be ingenious in dissembling with God, they delude themselves with
   the most frivolous evasions.

   It was a vain excuse of this kind that Christ condemned in Matthew
   5:34. James, now subscribing to the decree of his master, commands us
   to abstain from these indirect forms of swearing: for whosoever swears
   in vain and on frivolous occasions, profanes God's name, whatever form
   he may give to his words. Then the meaning is, that it is not more
   lawful to swear by heaven or by the earth, than openly by the name of
   God. The reason is mentioned by Christ -- because the glory of God is
   everywhere inscribed, and everywhere shines forth. Nay, men take the
   words, heaven and earth, in their oaths, in no other sense and for no
   other purpose, than if they named God himself; for by thus speaking
   they only designate the Worker by his works.

   But he says, above all things; because the profanation of God's name is
   not a slight offense. The Anabaptists, building on this passage,
   condemn all oaths, but they only shew their ignorance. For James does
   not speak of oaths in general, nor does Christ in the passage to which
   I have referred; but both condemn that evasion which had been devised,
   when men took the liberty to swear without expressing the name of God,
   which was a liberty repugnant to the prohibition of the law.

   And this is what the words clearly mean, Neither by heaven, neither by
   the earth. For, if the question had been as to oaths in themselves, to
   what purpose were these forms mentioned? It then appears evident that
   both by Christ and by James the puerile astuteness of those is reproved
   who taught that they could swear with impunity, provided they adopted
   some circuitous expressions. That we may, then, understand the meaning
   of James, we must understand first the precept of the law, "Thou shalt
   not take the name of God in vain." It hence appears clear, that there
   is a right and lawful use of God's name. Now, James condemns those who
   did not indeed dare in a direct way to profane God's name, but
   endeavored to evade the profanation which the law condemns, by
   circumlocutions.

   But let your yea be yea. He brings the best remedy to correct the vice
   which he condemns, that is, that they were habitually to keep
   themselves to truth and faithfulness in all their sayings. For whence
   is the wicked habit of swearing, except that such is the falsehood of
   men, that their words alone are not believed? For, if they observed
   faithfulness, as they ought, in their words, there would have been no
   necessity of so many superfluous oaths. As, then, the perfidy or levity
   of men is the fountain from which the vice of swearing flows, in order
   to take away the vice, James teaches us that the fountain ought to be
   removed; for the right way of healing is to begin with the cause of
   illness.

   Some copies have, "Let your word (or speech) be, yea, yea; no, no." The
   true reading however, is what I have given, and is commonly received;
   and what he means I have already explained, that is, that we ought to
   tell the truth, and to be faithful in our words. To the same purpose is
   what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 1:18, that he was not in his preaching
   yea and nay, but pursued the same course from the beginning.

   Lest ye fall into condemnation. There is a different reading, owing to
   the affinity of the words hupo krisin and hupokrisin [141] If you read,
   "into judgment" or condemnation, the sense will clearly be, that to
   take God's name in vain will not be unpunished. But it is not
   unsuitable to say, "into hypocrisy;" because when simplicity, as it has
   been already said, prevails among us, the occasion for superfluous
   oaths is cut off. If, then, fidelity appears in all we say, the
   dissimulation, which leads us to swear rashly, will be removed.

   13 Is any among you afflicted? he means that there is no time in which
   God does not invite us to himself. For afflictions ought to stimulate
   us to pray; prosperity supplies us with an occasion to praise God. But
   such is the perverseness of men, that they cannot rejoice without
   forgetting God, and that when afflicted they are disheartened and
   driven to despair. We ought, then, to keep within due bounds, so that
   the joy, which usually makes us to forget God, may induce us to set
   forth the goodness of God, and that our sorrow may teach us to pray.
   For he has set the singing of psalms in opposition to profane and
   unbridled joy; and thus they express their joy who are led, as they
   ought to be, by prosperity to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [141] For eis hupokrisin there are several MSS., but for hupo krisin
   there are not only several MSS., but the earliest versions, Syr. and
   Vulg.; so Griesbach takes the latter as the true reading.
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 5:14-15

   14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church;
   and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
   Lord:

   14 Infirmatur quis inter vos? Advocet presbyteros ecclesiae, et orent
   super eum, unguentes oleo in nomine Domini:

   15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall
   raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven
   him.

   15 Et oratio fidei servabit aegrotum, et excitabit eum Dominus; et si
   peccata admiserit, remittentur illi.


   14 Is any sick among you. As the gift of healing as yet continued, he
   directs the sick to have recourse to that remedy. It is, indeed,
   certain that they were not all healed; but the Lord granted this favor
   as often and as far as he knew it would be expedient; nor is it
   probable that the oil was indiscriminately applied, but only when there
   was some hope of restoration. For, together with the power there was
   given also discretion to the ministers, lest they should by abuse
   profane the symbol. The design of James was no other than to commend
   the grace of God which the faithful might then enjoy, lest the benefit
   of it should be lost through contempt or neglect.

   For this purpose he ordered the presbyters to be sent for, but the use
   of the anointing must have been confined to the power of the Holy
   Spirit.

   The Papists boast mightily of this passage, when they seek to pass off
   their extreme unction. But how different their corruption is from the
   ancient ordinance mentioned by James I will not at present undertake to
   shew. Let readers learn this from my Institutes. I will only say this,
   that this passage is wickedly and ignorantly perverted; when extreme
   unction is established by it, and is called a sacrament, to be
   perpetually observed in the Church. I indeed allow that it was used as
   a sacrament by the disciples of Christ, (for I cannot agree with those
   who think that it was medicine;) but as the reality of this sign
   continued only for a time in the Church, the symbol also must have been
   only for a time. And it is quite evident, that nothing is more absurd
   than to call that a sacrament which is void and does not really present
   to us that which it signifies. That the gift of healing was temporary,
   all are constrained to allow, and events clearly prove: then the sign
   of it ought not to be deemed perpetual. It hence follows, that they who
   at this day set anointing among the sacraments, are not the true
   followers, but the apes of the Apostles, except they restore the effect
   produced by it, which God has taken away from the world for more than
   fourteen hundred years. So we have no dispute, whether anointing was
   once a sacrament; but whether it has been given to be so perpetually.
   This latter we deny, because it is evident that the thing signified has
   long ago ceased.

   The presbyters, or elders, of the church. I include here generally all
   those who presided over the Church; for pastors were not alone called
   presbyters or elders, but also those who were chosen from the people to
   be as it were censors to protect discipline. For every Church had, as
   it were, its own senate, chosen from men of weight and of proved
   integrity. But as it was customary to choose especially those who were
   endued with gifts more than ordinary, he ordered them to send for the
   elders, as being those in whom the power and grace of the Holy Spirit
   more particularly appeared.

   Let them pray over him. This custom of praying over one was intended to
   shew, that they stood as it were before God; for when we come as it
   were to the very scene itself, we utter prayers with more feeling; and
   not only Elisha and Paul, but Christ himself, roused the ardor of
   prayer and commended the grace of God by thus praying over persons. (2
   Kings 4:32; Acts 20:10; John 11:41.)

   15. But it must be observed, that he connects a promise with the
   prayer, lest it should be made without faith. For he who doubts, as one
   who does not rightly call on God, is unworthy to obtain anything, as we
   have seen in the first chapter. Whosoever then really seeks to be
   heard, must be fully persuaded that he does not pray in vain.

   As James brings before us this special gift, to which the external rite
   was but an addition, we hence learn, that the oil could not have been
   rightly used without faith. But since it appears that the Papists have
   no certainty as to their anointing, as it is manifest that they have
   not the gift, it is evident that their anointing is spurious.

   And if he have committed sins. This is not added only for the sake of
   amplifying, as though he had said, that God would give something more
   to the sick than health of body; but because diseases were very often
   inflicted on account of sins; and by speaking of their remission he
   intimates that the cause of the evil would be removed. And we indeed
   see that David, when afflicted with disease and seeking relief, was
   wholly engaged in seeking the pardon of his sins. Why did he do this,
   except that while he acknowledged the effect of his faults in his
   punishment, he deemed that there was no other remedy, but that the Lord
   should cease to impute to him his sins?

   The prophets are full of this doctrine, that men are relieved from
   their evils when they are loosed from the guilt of their iniquities.
   Let us then know that it is the only fit remedy for our diseases and
   other calamities, when we carefully examine ourselves, being solicitous
   to be reconciled to God, and to obtain the pardon of our sins.
     __________________________________________________________________

   James 5:16-18

   16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that
   ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
   availeth much.

   16 Confitemini invicem peccata vestra, et orate invicem alii pro aliis,
   ut salvemini: multum valet precatio justi efficax.

   17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
   earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the
   space of three years and six months.

   17 Elias homo erat passionibus similiter obnoxius ut nos; et precatione
   precatus est, ne plueret; et non pluit super terram annos tres et sex
   menses.

   18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought
   forth her fruit.

   18 Et rursum oravit, et coelum dedit pluviam, et terra protulit fructum
   suum.


   16 Confess your faults one to another. In some copies the illative
   particle is given, nor is it unsuitable; for though when not expressed,
   it must be understood. He had said, that sins were remitted to the sick
   over whom the elders prayed: he now reminds them how useful it is to
   discover our sins to our brethren, even that we may obtain the pardon
   of them by their intercession. [142]

   This passage, I know, is explained by many as referring to the
   reconciling of offenses; for they who wish to return to favor must
   necessarily know first their own faults and confess them. For hence it
   comes, that hatreds take root, yea, and increase and become
   irreconcilable, because every one perniciously defends his own cause.
   Many therefore think that James points out here the way of brotherly
   reconciliation, that is, by mutual acknowledgment of sins. But as it
   has been said, his object was different; for he connects mutual prayer
   with mutual confession; by which he intimates that confession avails
   for this end, that we may be helped as to God by the prayers of our
   brethren; for they who know our necessities, are stimulated to pray
   that they may assist us; but they to whom our diseases are unknown are
   more tardy to bring us help.

   Wonderful, indeed, is the folly or the insincerity of the Papists, who
   strive to build their whispering confession on this passage. For it
   would be easy to infer from the words of James, that the priests alone
   ought to confess. For since a mutual, or to speak more plainly, a
   reciprocal confession is demanded here, no others are bidden to confess
   their own sins, but those who in their turn are fit to hear the
   confession of others; but this the priests claim for themselves alone.
   Then confession is required of them alone. But since their puerilities
   do not deserve a refutation, let the true and genuine explanation
   already given be deemed sufficient by us.

   For the words clearly mean, that confession is required for no other
   end, but that those who know our evils may be more solicitous to bring
   us help.

   Availeth much. That no one may think that this is done without fruit,
   that is, when others pray for us, he expressly mentions the benefit and
   the effect of prayer. But he names expressly the prayer of a righteous
   or just man; because God does not hear the ungodly; nor is access to
   God open, except through a good conscience: not that our prayers are
   founded on our own worthiness, but because the heart must be cleansed
   by faith before we can present ourselves before God. Then James
   testifies that the righteous or the faithful pray for us beneficially
   and not without fruit.

   But what does he mean by adding effectual or efficacious? For this
   seems superfluous; for if the prayer avails much, it is doubtless
   effectual. The ancient interpreter has rendered it "assiduous;" but
   this is too forced. For James uses the Greek participle, energoumenai,
   which means "working." And the sentence may be thus explained, "It
   avails much, because it is effectual." [143] As it is an argument drawn
   from this principle, that God will not allow the prayers of the
   faithful to be void or useless, he does not therefore unjustly conclude
   that it avails much. But I would rather confine it to the present case:
   for our prayers may properly be said to be energoumenai, working, when
   some necessity meets us which excites in us earnest prayer. We pray
   daily for the whole Church, that God may pardon its sins; but then only
   is our prayer really in earnest, when we go forth to succor those who
   are in trouble. But such efficacy cannot be in the prayers of our
   brethren, except they know that we are in difficulties. Hence the
   reason given is not general, but must be specially referred to the
   former sentence.

   17 Elias was a man. There are innumerable instances in Scripture of
   what he meant to prove; but he chose one that is remarkable above all
   others; for it was a great thing that God should make heaven in a
   manner subject to the prayers of Elias, so as to obey his wishes. Elias
   kept heaven shut by his prayers for three years and a half; he again
   opened it, so that it poured down abundance of rain. Hence appeared the
   wonderful power of prayer. Well known is this remarkable history, and
   is found in 1 Kings 17 and 1 Kings 18. And though it is not there
   expressly said, that Elias prayed for drought, it may yet be easily
   gathered, and that the rain also was given to his prayers.

   But we must notice the application of the example. James does not say
   that drought ought to be sought from the Lord, because Elias obtained
   it; for we may by inconsiderate zeal presumptuously and foolishly
   imitate the Prophet. We must then observe the rule of prayer, so that
   it may be by faith. He, therefore, thus accommodates this example, --
   that if Elias was heard, so also we shall be heard when we rightly
   pray. For as the command to pray is common, and as the promise is
   common, it follows that the effect also will be common.

   Lest any one should object and say, that we are far distant from the
   dignity of Elias, he places him in our own rank, by saying, that he was
   a mortal man and subject to the same passions with ourselves. For we
   profit less by the examples of saints, because we imagine them to have
   been half gods or heroes, who had peculiar intercourse with God; so
   that because they were heard, we receive no confidence. In order to
   shake off this heathen and profane superstition, James reminds us that
   the saints ought to be considered as having the infirmity of the flesh;
   so that we may learn to ascribe what they obtained from the Lord, not
   to their merits, but to the efficacy of prayer.

   It hence appears how childish the Papists are, who teach men to flee to
   the protection of saints, because they had been heard by the Lord. For
   thus they reason, "Because he obtained what he asked as long as he
   lived in the world, he will be now after death our best patron." This
   sort of subtle refinement was altogether unknown to the Holy Spirit.
   For James on the contrary argues, that as their prayers availed so
   much, so we ought in like manner to pray at this day according to their
   example, and that we shall not do so in vain.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [142] The illative oun, though found in some MSS., is not introduced
   into the text by Griesbach, there being no sufficient evidence in its
   favor. Nor does there appear a sufficient reason for the connection
   mentioned by Calvin. The two cases seem to be different. The elders of
   the church were in the previous instance to be called in, who were to
   pray and anoint the sick, and it is said that the prayer of faith (i.e.
   of miraculous faith) would save the sick, and that his sins would be
   forgiven him. This was clearly a case of miraculous healing. But what
   is spoken of in this verse seems to be quite different. Prayer is alone
   mentioned, not by the elders, but by a righteous man, not saving as in
   the former case, but availing much. It seems probable then that the
   sins of the sick miraculously healed were more especially against God;
   and that the sins which they were to confess to one another were
   against the brethren, also visited with judgment and the remedy for
   them was mutual confession, and mutual prayer; but the success in this
   case was not as sure or as certain as in the former, only we are told
   that an earnest prayer avails much. Then, to encourage this earnest or
   fervent prayer, the case of Elias is adduced; but it had nothing to do
   with miraculous healing.

   [143] This can hardly be admitted. The word expresses what sort of
   prayer is that which avails much. Besides, to avail much, and to be
   effectual, are two distinct things. The word as a verb and as a
   participle had commonly an active sense. Schleusner gives only one
   instance in which it has a passive meaning, 2 Corinthians 1:6; to which
   may be added 2 Corinthians 4:12. If taken passively, it may be
   rendered, "inwrought," that is, by the Spirit, according to Macknight.
   But it has been most commonly taken actively, and in the sense of the
   verbal adjective energes, energetic, powerful, ardent, fervent.

   James 5:19-20

   19 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;

   19 Fratres mei, si quis inter vos erraverit a veritate, et converterit
   quispiam eum;

   20 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of
   his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of
   sins.

   20 Cognoscat quod qui converterit peccatorem ab errore viae suae,
   servabit animam a morte, et multitudinem operiet peccatorum.


   20 Let him know. I doubt whether this ought rather to have been
   written, gisoskete, "know ye." Both ways the meaning however is the
   same. For James recommends to us the correction of our brethren from
   the effect produced that we may more assiduously attend to this duty.
   Nothing is better or more desirable than to deliver a soul from eternal
   death; and this is what he does who restores an erring brother to the
   right way: therefore a work so excellent ought by no means to be
   neglected. To give food to the hungry, and drink to the thirsty, we see
   how much Christ values such acts; but the salvation of the soul is
   esteemed by him much more precious than the life of the body. We must
   therefore take heed lest souls perish through our sloth, whose
   salvation God puts in a manner in our hands. Not that we can bestow
   salvation on them; but that God by our ministry delivers and saves
   those who seem otherwise to be nigh destruction.

   Some copies have his soul, which makes no change in the sense. I,
   however, prefer the other reading, for it has more force in it.

   And shall hide a multitude of sins. He makes an allusion to a saying of
   Solomon, rather than a quotation. (Proverbs 10:12.) Solomon says that
   love covers sins, as hatred proclaims them. For they who hate burn with
   the desire of mutual slander; but they who love are disposed to
   exercise mutual forbearance. Love, then, buries sins as to men. James
   teaches here something higher, that is, that sins are blotted out
   before God; as though he had said, Solomon has declared this as the
   fruit of love, that it covers sins; but there is no better or more
   excellent way of covering them than when they are wholly abolished
   before God. And this is done when the sinner is brought by our
   admonition to the right way: we ought then especially and more
   carefully to attend to this duty.

   THE ARGUMENT

   The doubts respecting this Epistle mentioned by Eusebius, ought not to
   keep us from reading it. For if the doubts rested on the authority of
   men, whose names he does not give, we ought to pay no more regard to it
   than to that of unknown men. And he afterwards adds, that it was
   everywhere received without any dispute. What Jerome writes influences
   me somewhat more, that some, induced by a difference in the style, did
   not think that Peter was the author. For though some affinity may be
   traced, yet I confess that there is that manifest difference which
   distinguishes different writers. There are also other probable
   conjectures by which we may conclude that it was written by another
   rather than by Peter. At the same time, according to the consent of
   all, it has nothing unworthy of Peter, as it shews everywhere the power
   and the grace of an apostolic spirit. If it be received as canonical,
   we must allow Peter to be the author, since it has his name inscribed,
   and he also testifies that he had lived with Christ: and it would have
   been a fiction unworthy of a minister of Christ, to have personated
   another individual. So then I conclude, that if the Epistle be deemed
   worthy of credit, it must have proceeded from Peter; not that he
   himself wrote it, but that some one of his disciples set forth in
   writing, by his command, those things which the necessity of the times
   required. For it is probable that he was now in extreme old age, for he
   says, that he was near his end. And it may have been that at the
   request of the godly, he allowed this testimony of his mind to be
   recorded shortly before his death, because it might have somewhat
   availed, when he was dead, to support the good, and to repress the
   wicked. Doubtless, as in every part of the Epistle the majesty of the
   Spirit of Christ appears, to repudiate it is what I dread, though I do
   not here recognize the language of Peter. But since it is not quite
   evident as to the author, I shall allow myself the liberty of using the
   word Peter or Apostle indiscriminately.

   I shall now come to the argument, which may be briefly stated.

   The design is to shew, that those who have once professed the true
   faith of Christ, ought to respond to their calling to the last. After
   having then extolled, in high terms, the grace of God, he recommends to
   them holiness of life, because God usually punishes in hypocrites a
   false profession of his name, with dreadful blindness, and on the other
   hand he increases his gifts to those who truly and from the heart
   embrace the doctrine of religion. He, therefore, exhorts them to prove
   their calling by a holy life. And, to give a greater weight to his
   admonitions, he says that he is already near his end, and at the same
   time, excuses himself that he so often repeated the same things, his
   object being that they who should remain alive on the earth after his
   death, might have what he, when alive, wrote, more deeply fixed in
   their minds.

   And as the foundation of true religion is the certainty or the truth of
   the gospel, he shews, first, how indubitable is its truth by this fact,
   -- that he himself had been an eyewitness of all things which it
   contains, and especially that he had heard Christ proclaimed from
   heaven to be the Son of God; and, in the second place, it was God's
   will that it should be borne witness to, and approved by the oracles of
   the prophets.

   He, however, predicts, at the same time, that danger was approaching
   from false teachers, who would spread impious inventions, as well as
   from the despisers of God, who would mock all religion; and he did
   this, that the faithful might learn to be watchful, and that they might
   be fortified. And he seems to have spoken thus designedly, lest they
   expected that the course of truth in the kingdom of Christ would be
   tranquil and peaceable, and free from all contention. He afterwards, as
   on a tablet, describes the character and manners of those who would, by
   their corruptions, pollute Christianity. But the description which he
   presents, especially suits the present age, as it will be more evident
   by a comparison. For he especially draws his pen against Lucianic men,
   who abandon themselves to every wickedness, and take a profane license
   to shew contempt to God, yea, and treat with ridicule the hope of a
   better life; and at this day we see that the world is everywhere full
   of such rabble.

   He further exhorts the faithful, not only to look always for the coming
   of Christ with suspended and expectant minds, but also to regard that
   day as present before their eyes, and in the meantime to keep
   themselves unpolluted for the Lord: in which doctrine he makes Paul as
   his associate and approver; and to defend his writings from the
   calumnies of the ungodly, he severely reproves all those who pervert
   them.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Peter 1:1-4

   1. Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that
   have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of
   God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:

   1. Simeon Petrus, et servus et apostolus Jesu Christi, iis quid aequè
   pretiosam nobiscum sortiti sunt fidem, per justitiam Dei nostri et
   Servatoris Jesu Christí,

   2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God,
   and of Jesus our Lord,

   2. Gratia vobis et pax multiplicetur per cognitionem (vel, cum
   cognitione) Dei et Jesu Domini nostri;

   3. According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that
   pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath
   called us to glory and virtue:

   3. Quemadmodum divina ejus potentia omnia nobis quae spectant ad vitam
   et pietatem dedit per cognitionem ejus qui vocavit nos propria gloria
   et virtute (vel, per gloriam virtutem):

   4. Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises:
   that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having
   escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

   4. Quibus et maximae pretiosae promissiones nobis donatae sunt, ut per
   Haec fieretis divinae consortes naturae, ubi fugeritis corruptionem
   quae in mundo est in concupiscentia.


   1. Simon Peter. Prayer takes the first place at the beginning of this
   Epistle, and then follows thanksgiving, by which he excites the Jews to
   gratitude, lest they should forget what great benefits they had already
   received from God's hand. Why he called himself the servant and an
   apostle of Jesus Christ, we have elsewhere stated, even because no one
   is to be heard in the Church, except he speaks as from the mouth of
   Christ. But the word servant has a more general meaning, because it
   includes all the ministers of Christ, who sustain any public office in
   the Church. There was in the apostleship a higher rank of honor. He
   then intimates, that he was not one from the rank of ministers, but was
   made by the Lord an apostle, and therefore superior to them. [144]

   Like precious faith. This is a commendation of the grace which God had
   indiscriminately shewed to all his elect people; for it was no common
   gift, that they had all been called to one and the same faith, since
   faith is the special and chief good of man. But he calls it like or
   equally precious, not that it is equal in all, but because all possess
   by faith the same Christ with his righteousness, and the same
   salvation. Though then the measure is different, that does not prevent
   the knowledge of God from being common to all, and the fruit which
   proceeds from it. Thus we have a real fellowship of faith with Peter
   and the Apostles.

   He adds, through the righteousness of God, in order that they might
   know that they did not obtain faith through their own efforts or
   strength, but through God's favor alone. For these things stand opposed
   the one to the other, the righteousness of God (in the sense in which
   it is taken here) and the merit of man. For the efficient cause of
   faith is called God's righteousness for this reason, because no one is
   capable of conferring it on himself. So the righteousness that is to be
   understood, is not that which remains in God, but that which he imparts
   to men, as in Romans 3:22. Besides, he ascribes this righteousness in
   common to God and to Christ, because it flows from God, and through
   Christ it flows down to us. [145]

   2. Grace and peace. By grace is designated God's paternal favor towards
   us. We have indeed been once for all reconciled to God by the death of
   Christ, and by faith we come to the possession of this so great a
   benefit; but as we perceive the grace of God according to the measure
   of our faith, it is said to increase according to our perception when
   it becomes more fully known to us.

   Peace is added; for as the beginning of our happiness is when God
   receives us into favor; so the more he confirms his love in our hearts,
   the richer blessing he confers on us, so that we become happy and
   prosperous in all things,

   Through the knowledge, literally, in the knowledge; but the preposition
   en often means "through" or "with:" yet both senses may suit the
   context. I am, however, more disposed to adopt the former. For the more
   any one advances in the knowledge of God, every kind of blessing
   increases also equally with the sense of divine love. Whosoever then
   aspires to the full fruition of the blessed life which is mentioned by
   Peter, must remember to observe the right way. He connects together at
   the same time the knowledge of God and of Christ; because God cannot be
   rightly known except in Christ, according to that saying,

   "No one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom
   the Son will reveal him." (Matthew 11:27)

   3. According as his divine power. He refers to the infinite goodness of
   God which they had already experienced, that they might more fully
   understand it for the future. For he continues the course of his
   benevolence perpetually to the end, except when we ourselves break it
   off by our unbelief; for he possesses exhaustless power and an equal
   will to do good. Hence the Apostle justly animates the faithful to
   entertain good hope by the consideration of the former benefits of God.
   [146] For the same purpose is the amplification which he makes; for he
   might have spoken more simply, "As he has freely given us all things."
   But by mentioning "divine power," he rises higher, that is, that God
   has copiously unfolded the immense resources of his power. But the
   latter clause may be referred to Christ as well as to the Father, but
   both are suitable. It may however be more fitly applied to Christ, as
   though he had said, that the grace which is conveyed to us by him, is
   an evidence of divinity, because it could not have done by humanity.

   That pertain to life and godliness, or, as to life and godliness. Some
   think that the present life is meant here, as godliness follows as the
   more excellent gift; as though by those two words Peter intended to
   prove how beneficent and bountiful God is towards the faithful, that he
   brought them to light, that he supplies them with all things necessary
   for the preservation of an earthly life, and that he has also renewed
   them to a spiritual life by adorning them with godliness. But this
   distinction is foreign to the mind of Peter, for as soon as he
   mentioned life, he immediately added godliness, which is as it were its
   soul; for God then truly gives us life, when he renews us unto the
   obedience of righteousness. So Peter does not speak here of the natural
   gifts of God, but only mentions those things which he confers
   peculiarly on his own elect above the common order of nature. [147]

   That we are born men, that we are endued with reason and knowledge,
   that our life is supplied with necessary support, -- all this is indeed
   from God. As however men, being perverted in their minds and
   ungrateful, do not regard these various things, which are called the
   gifts of nature, among God's benefits, the common condition of human
   life is not here referred to, but the peculiar endowments of the new
   and Spiritual life, which derive their origin from the kingdom of
   Christ. But since everything necessary for godliness and salvation is
   to be deemed among the supernatural gifts of God, let men learn to
   arrogate nothing to themselves, but humbly ask of God whatever they see
   they are wanting in, and to ascribe to him whatever good they may have.
   For Peter here, by attributing the whole of godliness, and all helps to
   salvation, to the divine power of Christ, takes them away from the
   common nature of men, so that he leaves to us not even the least
   particle of any virtue or merit.

   Through the knowledge of him. He now describes the manner in which God
   makes us partakers of so great blessings, even by making himself known
   to us by the gospel. For the knowledge of God is the beginning of life
   and the first entrance into godliness. In short, spiritual gifts cannot
   be given for salvation, until, being illuminated by the doctrine of the
   gospel, we are led to know God. But he makes God the author of this
   knowledge, because we never go to him except when called. Hence the
   effectual cause of faith is not the perspicacity of our mind, but the
   calling of God. And he speaks not of the outward calling only, which is
   in itself ineffectual; but of the inward calling, effected by the
   hidden power of the Spirit when God not only sounds in our ears by the
   voice of man, but draws inwardly our hearts to himself by his own
   Spirit.

   To glory and virtue, or, by his own glory and power. Some copies have
   idia doxHu, "by his own glory," and it is so rendered by the old
   interpreter; and this reading I prefer, because the sentence seems thus
   to flow better For it was Peter's object expressly to ascribe the whole
   praise of our salvation to God, so that we may know that we owe every
   thing to him. And this is more clearly expressed by these words, --
   that he has called us by his own glory and power. However, the other
   reading, though more obscure, tends to the same thing; for he teaches
   us, that we are covered with shame, and are wholly vicious, until God
   clothes us with glory and adorns us with virtue. He further intimates,
   that the effect of calling in the elect, is to restore to them the
   glorious image of God, and to renew them in holiness and righteousness.

   4. Whereby are given to us. It is doubtful whether he refers only to
   glory and power, or to the preceding things also. The whole difficulty
   arises from this, -- that what is here said is not suitable to the
   glory and virtue which God confers on us; but if we read, "by his own
   glory and power," there will be no ambiguity nor perplexity. For what
   things have been promised to us by God, ought to be properly and justly
   deemed to be the effects of his power and glory. [148]

   At the same time the copies vary here also; for some have di ' hon, "on
   account of whom;" so the reference may be to Christ. Whichsoever of the
   two readings you choose, still the meaning will be, that first the
   promises of God ought to be most highly valued; and, secondly, that
   they are gratuitous, because they are offered to us as gifts. And he
   then shews the excellency of the promises, that they make us partakers
   of the divine nature, than which nothing can be conceived better.

   For we must consider from whence it is that God raises us up to such a
   height of honor. We know how abject is the condition of our nature;
   that God, then, should make himself ours, so that all his things should
   in a manner become our things, the greatness of his grace cannot be
   sufficiently conceived by our minds. Therefore this consideration alone
   ought to be abundantly sufficient to make us to renounce the world and
   to carry us aloft to heaven. Let us then mark, that the end of the
   gospel is, to render us eventually conformable to God, and, if we may
   so speak, to deify us.

   But the word nature is not here essence but quality. The Manicheans
   formerly dreamt that we are a part of God, and that, after having run
   the race of life we shall at length revert to our original. There are
   also at this day fanatics who imagine that we thus pass over into the
   nature of God, so that his swallows up our nature. Thus they explain
   what Paul says, that God will be all in all (1 Corinthians 15:28,) and
   in the same sense they take this passage. But such a delirium as this
   never entered the minds of the holy Apostles; they only intended to say
   that when divested of all the vices of the flesh, we shall be partakers
   of divine and blessed immortality and glory, so as to be as it were one
   with God as far as our capacities will allow.

   This doctrine was not altogether unknown to Plato, who everywhere
   defines the chief good of man to be an entire conformity to God; but as
   he was involved in the mists of errors, he afterwards glided off to his
   own inventions. But we, disregarding empty speculations, ought to be
   satisfied with this one thing, -- that the image of God in holiness and
   righteousness is restored to us for this end, that we may at length be
   partakers of eternal life and glory as far as it will be necessary for
   our complete felicity.

   Having escaped We have already explained that the design of the Apostle
   was, to set before us the dignity of the glory of heaven, to which God
   invites us, and thus to draw us away from the vanity of this world.
   Moreover, he sets the corruption of the world in opposition to the
   divine nature; but he shews that this corruption is not in the elements
   which surround us, but in our heart, because there vicious and depraved
   affections prevail, the fountain and root of which he points out by the
   word lust. Corruption, then, is thus placed in the world, that we may
   know that the world is in us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [144] Simeon, and not Simon, is the name as here given, though a few
   copies and the Vulg. have Simon. His name is given both ways elsewhere;
   see Luke 5:8, and Acts 15:14. Why he called himself Peter in the first
   Epistle, and Simeon Peter here, does not appear. -- Ed.

   [145] It has been maintained by many, that the rendering of these words
   ought to be, "of our God and Savior Jesus Christ," In this case the en
   before "righteousness" would be rendered "in;" for it is more suitable
   to say that faith is in than through the righteousness of Christ.
   Christ is thus called here God as well as Savior; and so he is called
   "our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ" in chapter 3:18, the article being
   used in the same manner. -- Ed.

   [146] The connection here is variously regarded. Our version and Calvin
   seem to connect this verse with the foregoing, in this sense, that the
   Apostle prays for the increase of grace and peace from the
   consideration of what God had already done, or in conformity with his
   previous benefits. Others, perhaps more correctly, view this verse as
   connected with the 5th, and render hos, "Since," and the beginning of
   the 5th verse, "Do ye also for this reason, giving all diligence, add,"
   etc.; that is, "Since God has done so great things for you, ye also for
   this reason ought to be diligent in adding to your faith virtue, etc."
   But hos and kai may be rendered as and so. See Acts 7:51. "As his
   divine power... so for this reason, giving all diligence, add," etc. --
   Ed.

   [147] The order is according to what is common in Scripture; the chief
   thing is mentioned first, and then that which leads to it. -- Ed.

   [148] The received text no doubt contains the true rending. The word
   arete never means "power" either in the classics, or in the Sept., or
   in the New Testament. Beza and also Schleusner, regard dia as
   expressing the final cause, to; it is also used in the sense of "for
   the sake of," or, "on account of." "Glory and virtue" are in a similar
   order as the previous words, "life and godliness," and also in the same
   order with the concluding words of the next verse, "partakers of the
   divine nature," and "escaping the corruptions of the world." So that
   there is a correspondence as to the order of the words throughout the
   whole passage. With respect to di ' on, the rendering may be, "for the
   sake of which," that is, for the purpose of leading us to "glory and
   virtue,"" many and precious promises have been given; and then the
   conclusion of the verse states the object in other words, that we might
   by these promises become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped
   the pollutions of the world. Escaping the corruption of the world is
   "godliness," is "virtue;" and partaking of the divine nature is "life,"
   is "glory." This complete correspondence confirms the meaning which
   Beza and our version give to the preposition dia at the end of the
   third verse. -- Ed.

   2 Peter 1:5-9

   5. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and
   to virtue knowledge;

   5. Atque in hoc ipsum omne studium applicantes, subministrate in fide
   vestra virtutem, in virtute autem scientiam;

   6. And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to
   patience godliness;

   6. In scientia verae temperantiam, in temperantia autem patientiam, in
   patientia verò pietatem,

   7. And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
   charity.

   7. In pietate autem fraternum amorem, in fraterno verò amore
   charitatem.

   8. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye
   shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   8. Haec enim si vobis adsint, et abunde, suppetant, non otiosos neque
   infructuosos constituent vos in cognitione Domini nostri Jesu Christi.

   9. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off,
   and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

   9. Cui enim Haec non adsunt, caecus est, manu palpans, purgationis
   oblitus veterum delictorum.


   5 And besides this. As it is a work arduous and of immense labor, to
   put off the corruption which is in us, he bids us to strive and make
   every effort for this purpose. He intimates that no place is to be
   given in this case to sloth, and that we ought to obey God calling us,
   not slowly or carelessly, but that there is need of alacrity; as though
   he had said, "Put forth every effort, and make your exertions manifest
   to all." -- For this is what the participle he uses imports.

   Add to your faith virtue, or, Supply to your faith virtue. He shews for
   what purpose the faithful were to strive, that is, that they might have
   faith adorned with good morals, wisdom, patience, and love. Then he
   intimates that faith ought not to be naked or empty, but that these are
   its inseparable companions. To supply to faith, is to add to faith.
   There is not here, however, properly a gradation as to the sense,
   though it appears as to the words; for love does not in order follow
   patience, nor does it proceed from it. Therefore the passage is to be
   thus simply explained, "Strive that virtue, prudence, temperance, and
   the things which follow, may be added to your faith." [149]

   I take virtue to mean a life honest and rightly formed; for it is not
   here energeia, energy or courage, but arete, virtue, moral goodness.
   Knowledge is what is necessary for acting prudently; for after having
   put down a general term, he mentions some of the principal endowments
   of a Christian. Brotherly-kindness, philadelphia, is mutual affection
   among the children of God. Love extends wider, because it embraces all
   mankind.

   It may, however, be here asked, whether Peter, by assigning to us the
   work of supplying or adding virtue, thus far extolled the strength and
   power of free-will? They who seek to establish free-will in man, indeed
   concede to God the first place, that is, that he begins to act or work
   in us; but they imagine that we at the same time co-operate, and that
   it is thus owing to us that the movements of God are not rendered void
   and inefficacious. But the perpetual doctrine of Scripture is opposed
   to this delirious notion: for it plainly testifies, that right feelings
   are formed in us by God, and are rendered by him effectual. It
   testifies also that all our progress and perseverance are from God.
   Besides, it expressly declares that wisdom, love, patience, are the
   gifts of God and the Spirit. When, therefore, the Apostle requires
   these things, he by no means asserts that they are in our power, but
   only shews what we ought to have, and what ought to be done. And as to
   the godly, when conscious of their own infirmity, they find themselves
   deficient in their duty, nothing remains for them but to flee to God
   for aid and help. [150]

   8. For if these things be in you. Then, he says, you will at length
   prove that Christ is really known by you, if ye be endued with virtue,
   temperance, and the other endowments. For the knowledge of Christ is an
   efficacious thing and a living root, which brings forth fruit. For by
   saying that these things would make them neither barren nor unfruitful,
   he shews that all those glory, in vain and falsely, that they have the
   knowledge of Christ, who boast of it without love, patience, and the
   like gifts, as Paul also says in Ephesians 4:20,

   "Ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard him, and
   have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus, that ye put off the
   old man," etc.

   For he means that those who possess Christ without newness of life,
   have never been rightly taught his doctrine.

   But he would not have the faithful to be only taught patience,
   godliness, temperance, love; but he requires a continual progress to be
   made as to these endowments, and that justly, for we are as yet far off
   from the goal. We ought, therefore, always to make advances, so that
   God's gifts may continually increase in us.

   9. But he that lacketh these things. He now expresses more clearly that
   they who profess a naked faith are wholly without any true knowledge.
   He then says that they go astray like the blind in darkness, because
   they do not see the right way which is shewn to us by the light of the
   gospel. [151] This he also confirms by adding this reason, because such
   have forgotten that through the benefit of Christ they had been
   cleansed from sin, and yet this is the beginning of our Christianity.
   It then follows, that those who do not strive for a pure and holy life,
   do not understand even the first rudiments of faith.

   But Peter takes this for granted, that they who were still rolling in
   the filth of the flesh had forgotten their own purgation. For the blood
   of Christ has not become a washing bath to us, that it may be fouled by
   our filth. He, therefore, calls them old sins, by which he means, that
   our life ought to be otherwise formed, because we have been cleansed
   from our sins; not that any one can be pure from every sin while he
   lives in this world, or that the cleansing we obtain through Christ
   consists of pardon only, but that we ought to differ from the
   unbelieving, as God has separated us for himself. Though, then, we
   daily sin, and God daily forgives us, and the blood of Christ cleanses
   us from our sins, yet sin ought not to rule in us, but the
   sanctification of the Spirit ought to prevail in us; for so Paul
   teaches us in 1 Corinthians 6:11, "And such were some of you; but ye
   are washed," etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [149] Some, like Bishop Warburton, have very ingeniously attempted to
   shew that there is here a regular order and gradation; but it is not
   the order of cause and effect. Different things are mentioned, and what
   is added, has in some way or another a connection with the previous
   word. To faith add virtue or moral conduct; that virtue may be rightly
   formed, add knowledge; that knowledge may be gained, add temperance;
   that temperance may continue, add patience or perseverance; that
   perseverance may be retained, add godliness or piety, that is, prayer
   to God; that godliness may not be alone, add brotherly-kindness; and
   that brotherly kindness may he enlarged, add love to all mankind. The
   word added has a connection with the immediately previous word, as the
   way, means, or an addition. -- Ed.

   [150] The question of free-will does not properly belong to this
   passage; for the Apostle writes, not to those in their natural state,
   but to those whom he considered to be new creatures. The question of
   free-will ought to be confined to conversion, and not extended to the
   state of those who have been converted. The tenth article of the Church
   of England nearly meets the question, yet not wholly: it ascribes the
   will to turn most distinctly to God, and says that man cannot turn
   himself; but it does not expressly say whether man can resist the
   good-will given him, which is the very gist of the question. But it
   says further, that the grace of God by Christ "worketh with us when we
   have that good-will," which seems certainly to imply, that the
   good-will first given is made thereby effectual. If there be, then, a
   cooperation, (as no doubt there is,) it is the cooperation, according
   to this Article, of the good-will first given, and not of anything in
   man by nature. -- Ed.

   [151] "He is blind, (manu palpans) stroking with the hand," is
   Calvin's; the Vulgate is manu tentans, "feeling with the hand:" but the
   original word means, "closing the eyes," according to the Greek
   grammarians, Hesychius and Suidas: "He is blind, closing his eyes." --
   Ed.

   2 Peter 1:10-15

   10. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling
   and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:

   10. Quamobrem magis, fratres, studete firmam vestram vocationem et
   electionem facere: Haec enim si feceritis, non cadetis unquam:

   11. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the
   everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

   11. Sic enim abundè subministrabitur vobis ingressus in regnum eternum
   Domini nostri et Servatoris Jesu Christi.

   12. Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance
   of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present
   truth.

   12. Itaque non negligam semper de iis commonefacere, etiamsi noveritis,
   et confirmati sitis in praesenti veritate.

   13. Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
   you up by putting you in remembrance;

   13. Justum autem arbitror, quandiu sum in hoc tabernaculo, vos
   admonitione;

   l4. Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our
   Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.

   14. Quum sciam brevi me depositurum hoc tabernaculum, quemadmodum et
   Dominus Jesus manifestavit mihi.

   15. Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to
   have these things always in remembrance.

   15. Dabo autem operam, ut etiam semper post meum discessum possitis
   horum habere memoriam.


   10. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence. He draws this
   conclusion, that it is one proof that we have been really elected, and
   not in vain called by the Lord, if a good conscience and integrity of
   life correspond with our profession of faith. And he infers, that there
   ought to be more labor and diligence, because he had said before, that
   faith ought not to be barren.

   Some copies have, "by good works;" but these words make no change in
   the sense, for they are to be understood though not expressed. [152]

   He mentions calling first, though the last in order. The reason is,
   because election is of greater weight or importance; and it is a right
   arrangement of a sentence to subjoin what preponderates. The meaning
   then is, labor that you may have it really proved that you have not
   been called nor elected in vain. At the same time he speaks here of
   calling as the effect and evidence of election. If any one prefers to
   regard the two words as meaning the same thing, I do not object; for
   the Scripture sometimes merges the difference which exists between two
   terms. I have, however, stated what seems to me more probable. [153]

   Now a question arises, Whether the stability of our calling and
   election depends on good works, for if it be so, it follows that it
   depends on us. But the whole Scripture teaches us, first, that God's
   election is founded on his eternal purpose; and secondly, that calling
   begins and is completed through his gratuitous goodness. The Sophists,
   in order to transfer what is peculiar to God's grace to ourselves,
   usually pervert this evidence. But their evasions may be easily
   refuted. For if any one thinks that calling is rendered sure by men,
   there is nothing absurd in that; we may however, go still farther, that
   every one confirms his calling by leading a holy and pious life. But it
   is very foolish to infer from this what the Sophists contend for; for
   this is a proof not taken from the cause, but on the contrary from the
   sign or the effect. Moreover, this does not prevent election from being
   gratuitous, nor does it shew that it is in our own hand or power to
   confirm election. For the matter stands thus, -- God effectually calls
   whom he has preordained to life in his secret counsel before the
   foundation of the world; and he also carries on the perpetual course of
   calling through grace alone. But as he has chosen us, and calls us for
   this end, that we may be pure and spotless in his presence; purity of
   life is not improperly called the evidence and proof of election, by
   which the faithful may not only testify to others that they are the
   children of God, but also confirm themselves in this confidence, in
   such a manner, however, that they fix their solid foundation on
   something else.

   At the same time, this certainty, mentioned by Peter, ought, I think,
   to be referred to the conscience, as though the faithful acknowledged
   themselves before God to be chosen and called. But I take it simply of
   the fact itself, that calling appears as confirmed by this very
   holiness of life. It may, indeed, be rendered, Labor that your calling
   may become certain; for the verb poieisthai is transitive or
   intransitive. Still, however you may render it, the meaning is nearly
   the same.

   The import of what is said is, that the children of God are
   distinguished from the reprobate by this mark, that they live a godly
   and a holy life, because this is the design and end of election. Hence
   it is evident how wickedly some vile unprincipled men prattle, when
   they seek to make gratuitous election an excuse for all licentiousness;
   as though, forsooth! we may sin with impunity, because we have been
   predestinated to righteousness and holiness!

   For if ye do these things. Peter seems again to ascribe to the merits
   of works, that God furthers our salvation, and also that we continually
   persevere in his grace. But the explanation is obvious; for his purpose
   was only to shew that hypocrites have in them nothing real or solid,
   and that, on the contrary, they who prove their calling sure by good
   works, are free from the danger of falling, because sure and sufficient
   is the grace of God by which they are supported. Thus the certainty of
   our salvation by no means depends on us, as doubtless the cause of it
   is beyond our limits. But with regard to those who feel in themselves
   the efficacious working of the Spirit, Peter bids them to take courage
   as to the future, because the Lord has laid in them the solid
   foundation of a true and sure calling.

   He explains the way or means of persevering, when he says, an entrance
   shall be ministered to you. The import of the words is this: "God, by
   ever supplying you abundantly with new graces, will lead you to his own
   kingdom." And this was added, that we may know, that though we have
   already passed from death into life, yet it is a passage of hope; and
   as to the fruition of life, there remains for us yet a long journey. In
   the meantime we are not destitute of necessary helps. Hence Peter
   obviates a doubt by these words, "The Lord will abundantly supply your
   need, until you shall enter into his eternal kingdom." He calls it the
   kingdom of Christ, because we cannot ascend to heaven except under his
   banner and guidance.

   12. Wherefore I will not be negligent. As we seem to distrust either
   the memory or the attention of those whom we often remind of the same
   thing, the Apostle makes this modest excuse, that he ceased not to
   press on the attention of the faithful what was well known and fixed in
   their minds, because its importance and greatness required this.

   "Ye do, indeed," he says, "fully understand what the truth of the
   gospel is, nor have I to confirm as it were the wavering, but in a
   matter so great, admonitions are never superfluous; and, therefore,
   they ought never to be deemed vexatious." Paul also employs a similar
   excuse in Romans 15:14,

   "I am persuaded of you, brethren," he says, "that ye are full of
   knowledge, so as to be able to admonish one another: but I have more
   confidently written to you, as putting you in mind."

   He calls that the present truth, into the possession of which they had
   already entered by a sure faith. He, then, commends their faith, in
   order that they might remain fixed in it more firmly.

   13. Yea, I think it meet, or right. He expresses more clearly how
   useful and how necessary is admonition, because it is needful to arouse
   the faithful, for otherwise torpor will creep in from the flesh.
   Though, then, they might not have wanted teaching, yet he says that the
   goads of admonitions were useful, lest security and indulgence (as it
   is usually the case) should weaken what they had learned, and at length
   extinguish it.

   He adds another cause why he was so intent on writing to them, because
   he knew that a short time remained for him. "I must diligently employ
   my time," he says; "for the Lord has made known to me that my life in
   this world will not be long."

   We hence learn, that admonitions ought to be so given, that the people
   whom we wish to benefit may not think that wrong is done to them, and
   also that offenses ought to be so avoided, that yet the truth may have
   a free course, and exhortations may not be discontinued. Now, this
   moderation is to be observed towards those to whom a sharp reproof
   would not be suitable, but who ought on the contrary to be kindly
   helped, since they are inclined of themselves to do their duty. We are
   also taught by the example of Peter, that the shorter term of life
   remains to us, the more diligent ought we to be in executing our
   office. It is not commonly given to us to foresee our end; but they who
   are advanced in years, or weakened by illness, being reminded by such
   indications of the shortness of their life, ought to be more sedulous
   and diligent, so that they may in due time perform what the Lord has
   given them to do; nay, those who are the strongest and in the flower of
   their age, as they do not render to God so constant a service as it
   behooves them to do, ought to quicken themselves to the same care and
   diligence by the recollection of approaching death; lest the occasion
   of doing good may pass away, while they attend negligently and
   slothfully to their work.

   At the same time, I doubt not but that it was Peter's object to gain
   more authority and weight to his teaching, when he said that he would
   endeavor to make them to remember these things after his death, which
   was then nigh at hand. For when any one, shortly before he quits this
   life, addresses us, his words have in a manner the force and power of a
   testament or will, and are usually received by us with greater
   reverence.

   14 I must put off this my tabernacle. Literally the words are, "Short
   is the putting; away of this tabernacle." By this mode of speaking, and
   afterwards by the word "departing," he designates death, which it
   behooves us to notice; for we are here taught how much death differs
   from perdition. Besides, too much dread of death terrifies us, because
   we do not sufficiently consider how fading and evanescent this life is,
   and do not reflect on the perpetuity of future life. But what does
   Peter say? He declares that death is departing from this world, that we
   may remove elsewhere, even to the Lord. It ought not, then, to be
   dreadful to us, as though we were to perish when we die. He declares
   that it is the putting away of a tabernacle, by which we are covered
   only for a short time. There is, then, no reason why we should regret
   to be removed from it.

   But there is to be understood an implied contrast between a fading
   tabernacle and a perpetual habitation, which Paul explains in 2
   Corinthians 5:1. [154]

   When he says that it had been revealed to him by Christ, he refers not
   to the kind of death, but to the time. But if he received the oracle at
   Babylon respecting his death being near, how was he crucified at Rome?
   It certainly appears that he died very far from Italy, except he flew
   in a moment over seas and lands. [155] But the Papists, in order to
   claim for themselves the body of Peter, make themselves Babylonians,
   and say that Rome is called Babylon by Peter: this shall be refuted in
   its proper place. What he says of remembering these things after his
   death, was intended to shew, that posterity ought to learn from him
   when dead. For the apostles had not regard only for their own age, but
   purposed to do us good also. Though, then, they are dead, their
   doctrine lives and prevails: and it is our duty to profit by their
   writings, as though they were manifestly present with. us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [152] There is no sufficient authority for introducing them. Besides,
   there is no need of them, for the word tauta, "these things," has been
   often previously repeated, and refers to the things mentioned in verses
   5, 6, and 7. -- Ed.

   [153] The order is such as we often meet with, the visible effect
   first, and then the cause, as in Romans 10:9; confession, the
   ostensible act, is mentioned first, and then faith, which precedes it.
   So here, calling, the effect produced, is first mentioned, and then
   election, the cause of it; as though he had said, "Make your calling,
   which has proceeded from your election, sure." -- Ed.

   [154] Paul, at the beginning of this chapter, compares our state in
   this world in a fading body with our state above after the resurrection
   in a glorified body, and takes no account of the intervening time
   between death and the resurrection. By keeping this in view, the whole
   passage, otherwise obscure, will appear quite clear. He speaks of being
   unclothed and clothed, that is, of being divested of one body, and of
   putting on another; and consistently with this view he speaks of not
   being found naked, that is, without a body as a covering. -- Ed.

   [155] It has been disputed, whether he refers here to what is recorded
   in John 21:18, 19, or to a new revelation. The latter was the opinion
   of some of the ancient fathers; and not without reason, for in John the
   manner of his death is what is mentioned, but here the near approach of
   it, -- two things wholly distinct. -- Ed.

   2 Peter 1:16-18

   16. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made
   known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were
   eyewitnesses of his majesty.

   16. Neque enim fabulas subtiliter excogitatas (vel, arte compositas)
   sequuti, notam vobis fecimus Domini nostri Jesu Christi potentiam et
   adventum; sed spectatores facti ejus magnificentiae.

   17. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there
   came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved
   Son, in whom I am well pleased.

   17. Accepit enim à Deo Patre honorém et gloriam, allata illi à
   magnifica gloria hujusmodi voce, Hie Filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi
   complacui.

   18. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with
   him in the holy mount.

   18. Et hanc vocem nos audivimus, dum essemus in monte sancto cum illo.


   16. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables. It gives us much
   courage, when we know that we labor in a matter that is certain. Lest,
   then, the faithful should think that in these labors they were beating
   the air, he now comes to set forth the certainty of the gospel; and he
   denies that anything had been delivered by him but what was altogether
   true and indubitable: and they were encouraged to persevere, when they
   were sure of the prosperous issue of their calling.

   In the first place, Peter indeed asserts that he had been an
   eyewitness; for he had himself seen with his own eyes the glory of
   Christ, of which he speaks. This knowledge he sets in opposition to
   crafty fables, such as cunning men are wont to fabricate to ensnare
   simple minds. The old interpreter renders the word "feigned," (fictas;)
   Erasmus, "formed by art." It seems to me that what is subtle to deceive
   is meant: for the Greek word here used, sophizesthai, sometimes means
   this. And we know how much labor men bestow on frivolous refinements,
   and only that they may have some amusement. Therefore no less seriously
   ought our minds to be applied to know the truth which is not
   fallacious, and the doctrine which is not nugatory, and which discovers
   to us the glory of the Son of God and our own salvation. [156]

   The power and the coming. No doubt he meant in these words to include
   the substance of the gospel, as it certainly contains nothing except
   Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom. But he distinctly
   mentions two things, -- that Christ had been manifested in the flesh,
   -- and also that power was exhibited by him. [157] Thus, then, we have
   the whole gospel; for we know that he, the long-promised Redeemer, came
   from heaven, put on our flesh, lived in the world, died and rose again;
   and, in the second place, we perceive the end and fruit of all these
   things, that is, that he might be God with us, that he might exhibit in
   himself a sure pledge of our adoption, that he might cleanse us from
   the defilement's of the flesh by the grace of his Spirit, and
   consecrate us temples to God, that he might deliver us from hell, and
   raise us up to heaven, that he might by the sacrifice of his death make
   an atonement for the sins of the world, that he might reconcile us to
   the Father, that he might become to us the author of righteousness and
   of life. He who knows and understands these things, is fully acquainted
   with the gospel.

   Were eyewitnesses, or beholders [158] We hence conclude, that they by
   no means serve Christ, nor are like the apostles, who presumptuously
   mount the pulpit to prattle of speculations unknown to themselves; for
   he alone is the lawful minister of Christ, who knows the truth of the
   doctrine which he delivers: not that all obtain certainty in the same
   way; for what Peter says is that he himself was present, when Christ
   was declared by a voice from heaven to be the Son of God. Three only
   were then present, but they were sufficient as witnesses; for they had
   through many miracles seen the glory of Christ, and had a remarkable
   evidence of his divinity in his resurrection. But we now obtain
   certainty in another way; for though Christ has not risen before our
   eyes, yet we know by whom his resurrection has been handed down to us.
   And added to this is the inward testimony of conscience, the sealing of
   the Spirit, which far exceeds all the evidence of the senses. But let
   us remember that the gospel was not at the beginning made up of vague
   rumors, but that the apostles were the authentic preachers of what they
   had seen.

   17. For he received from God the Father. He chose one memorable example
   out of many, even that of Christ, when, adorned with celestial glory,
   he conspicuously displayed his divine majesty to his three disciples.
   And though Peter does not relate all the circumstances, yet he
   sufficiently designates them when he says, that a voice came from the
   magnificent glory. For the meaning is, that nothing earthly was seen
   there, but that a celestial majesty shone on every side. We may hence
   conclude what those displays of greatness were which the evangelists
   relate. And it was necessarily thus done, in order that the authority
   of that voice which came might be more awful and solemn, as we see that
   it was done all at once by the Lord. For when he spoke to the fathers,
   he did not only cause his words to sound in the air, but by adding some
   symbols or tokens of his presence, he proved the oracles to be his.

   This is my beloved Son. Peter then mentions this voice, as though it
   was sufficient alone, as a full evidence for the gospel, and justly so.
   For when Christ is acknowledged by us to be him whom the Father has
   sent, this is our highest wisdom. There are two parts to this sentence.
   When he says, "This is," the expression is very emphatical, intimating,
   that he was the Messiah who had been so often promised. Whatever, then,
   is found in the Law and the Prophets respecting the Messiah, is
   declared here, by the Father, to belong to him whom he so highly
   commended. In the other part of the sentence, he announces Christ as
   his own Son, in whom his whole love dwells and centres. It hence
   follows that we are not otherwise loved than in him, nor ought the love
   of God to be sought anywhere else. It is sufficient for me now only to
   touch on these things by the way.

   18. In the holy mount. He calls it the holy mount, for the same reason
   that the ground was called holy where God appeared to Moses. For
   wherever the Lord comes, as he is the fountain of all holiness, he
   makes holy all things by the odor of his presence. And by this mode of
   speaking we are taught, not only to receive God reverently wherever he
   shews himself, but also to prepare ourselves for holiness, as soon as
   he comes nigh us, as it was commanded the people when the law was
   proclaimed on Mount Sinai. And it is a general truth,

   "Be ye holy, for I am holy, who dwell in the midst of you."
   (Leviticus 11:44; 19:2.)

   2 Peter 1:19-21

   19. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well
   that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until
   the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:

   19. Et habemus firmiorem propheticum sermonem, cui bene facitis
   attendentes, tanquam lucernae apparenti in caliginoso loco, donee
   illuceat dies, et lucifer oriatur in cordibus vestris;

   20. Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any
   private interpretation.

   20. Hoc primùm cognito, quòd omnis prophetia scripturae privatae (vel,
   proprii motus) interpretationis non est:

   21. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy
   men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

   21. Neque enim voluntate hominis allata est quondam prophetia; sed à
   Spiritu Sancto impulsi, loquuti sunt sancti Dei homines.


   19. We have also. He now shews that the truth of the gospel is founded
   on the oracles of the prophets, lest they who embraced it should
   hesitate to devote themselves wholly to Christ: for they who waver
   cannot be otherwise than remiss in their minds. But when he says, "We
   have," he refers to himself and other teachers, as well as to their
   disciples. The apostles had the prophets as the patrons of their
   doctrine; the faithful also sought from them a confirmation of the
   gospel. I am the more disposed to take this view, because he speaks of
   the whole Church, and makes himself one among others. At the same time,
   he refers more especially to the Jews, who were well acquainted with
   the doctrine of the prophets. And hence, as I think, he calls their
   word more sure or firmer

   For they who take the comparative for a positive, that is, "more sure,"
   for "sure," do not sufficiently consider the whole context. The sense
   also is a forced one, when it is said to be "more sure," because God
   really completed what he had promised concerning his Son. For the truth
   of the gospel is here simply proved by a twofold testimony, -- that
   Christ had been highly approved by the solemn declaration of God, and,
   then, that all the prophecies of the prophets confirmed the same thing.
   But it appears at first sight strange, that the word of the prophets
   should be said to be more sure or firmer than the voice which came from
   the holy mouth of God himself; for, first, the authority of God's word
   is the same from the beginning; and, secondly, it was more confirmed
   than previously by the coming of Christ. But the solution of this knot
   is not difficult: for here the Apostle had a regard to his own nation,
   who were acquainted with the prophets, and their doctrine was received
   without any dispute. As, then, it was not doubted by the Jews but that
   all the things which the prophets had taught, came from the Lord, it is
   no wonder that Peter said that their word was more sure. Antiquity also
   gains some reverence. There are, besides, some other circumstances
   which ought to be noticed; particularly, that no suspicion could be
   entertained as to those prophecies in which the kingdom of Christ had
   so long before been predicted.

   The question, then, is not here, whether the prophets deserve more
   credit than the gospel; but Peter regarded only this, to shew how much
   deference the Jews paid to those who counted the prophets as God's
   faithful ministers, and had been brought up from childhood in their
   school. [159]

   Whereunto ye do well. This passage is, indeed, attended with some more
   difficulty; for it may be asked, what is the day which Peter mentions?
   To some it seems to be the clear knowledge of Christ, when men fully
   acquiesce in the gospel; and the darkness they explain as existing,
   when they, as yet, hesitate in suspense, and the doctrine of the gospel
   is not received as indubitable; as though Peter praised those Jews who
   were searching for Christ in the Law and the Prophets, and were
   advancing, as by this preceding light towards Christ, the Sun of
   righteousness, as they were praised by Luke, who, having heard Paul
   preaching, searched the Scripture to know whether what he said was
   true. (Acts 17:11)

   But in this view there is, first, an inconsistency, because it thus
   seems that the use of the prophecies is confined to a short time, as
   though they would be superfluous when the gospel-light is seen. Were
   one to object and say, that this does not necessarily follow, because
   until does not always denote the end. To this I say, that in commands
   it cannot be otherwise taken: "Walk until you finish your course;"
   "Fight until you conquer." In such expressions we doubtless see that a
   certain time is specified. [160] But were I to concede this point, that
   the reading of the prophets is not thus wholly cast aside; yet every
   one must see how frigid is this commendation, that the prophets are
   useful until Christ is revealed to us; for their teaching is necessary
   to us until the end of life. Secondly, we must bear in mind who they
   were whom Peter addressed; for he was not instructing the ignorant and
   novices, who were as yet in the first rudiments; but even those
   respecting whom he had before testified, that they had obtained the
   same precious faith, and were confirmed in the present truth. Surely
   the gross darkness of ignorance could not have been ascribed to such
   people. I know what some allege, that all had not made the same
   progress, and that here beginners who were as yet seeking Christ, are
   admonished.

   But as it is evident from the context, that the words were addressed to
   the same persons, the passage must necessarily be applied to the
   faithful who had already known Christ, and had become partakers of the
   true light. I therefore extend this darkness, mentioned by Peter, to
   the whole course of life, and the day, I consider will then shine on us
   when we shall see face to face, what we now see through a glass darkly.
   Christ, the Sun of righteousness, indeed, shines forth in the gospel;
   but the darkness of death will always, in part, possess our minds,
   until we shall be brought out of the prison of the flesh, and be
   translated into heaven. This, then, will be the brightness of day, when
   no clouds or mists of ignorance shall intercept the bright shining of
   the Sun.

   And doubtless we are so far from a perfect day, as our faith is from
   perfection. It is, therefore, no wonder that the state of the present
   life is called darkness, since we are far distant from that knowledge
   to which the gospel invites us. [161]

   In short, Peter reminds us that as long as we sojourn in this world, we
   have need of the doctrine of the prophets as a guiding light; which
   being extinguished, we can do nothing else but wander in darkness; for
   he does not disjoin the prophecies from the gospel, when he teaches us
   that they shine to shew us the way. His object only was to teach us
   that the whole course of our life ought to be guided by God's word; for
   otherwise we must be involved on every side in the darkness of
   ignorance; and the Lord does not shine on us, except when we take his
   word as our light.

   But he does not use the comparison, light, or lamp, to intimate that
   the light is small and sparing, but to make these two things to
   correspond,--that we are without light, and can no more keep on the
   right way than those who go astray in a dark night; and that the Lord
   brings a remedy for this evil, when he lights a torch to guide us in
   the midst of darkness.

   What he immediately adds respecting the day star does not however seem
   altogether suitable to this explanation; for the real knowledge, to
   which we are advancing through life, cannot be called the beginning of
   the day. To this I reply, that different parts of the day are compared
   together, but the whole day in all its parts is set in opposition to
   that darkness, which would wholly overspread all our faculties, were
   not the Lord to come to our help by the light of his word.

   This is a remarkable passage: we learn from it how God guides us. The
   Papists have ever and anon in their mouth, that the Church cannot err.
   Though the word is neglected, they yet imagine that it is guided by the
   Spirit. But Peter, on the contrary, intimates that all are immersed in
   darkness who do not attend to the light of the word. Therefore, except
   thou art resolved wilfully to cast thyself into a labyrinth, especially
   beware of departing even in the least thing from the rule and direction
   of the word. Nay, the Church cannot follow God as its guide, except it
   observes what the word prescribes.

   In this passage Peter also condemns all the wisdom of men, in order
   that we may learn humbly to seek, otherwise than by our own
   understanding, the true way of knowledge; for without the word nothing
   is left for men but darkness.

   It further deserves to be noticed, that he pronounces on the clearness
   of Scripture; for what is said would be a false eulogy, were not the
   Scripture fit and suitable to shew to us with certainty the right way.
   Whosoever, then, will open his eyes through the obedience of faith,
   shall by experience know that the Scripture has not been in vain called
   a light. It is, indeed, obscure to the unbelieving; but they who are
   given up to destruction are wilfully blind. Execrable, therefore, is
   the blasphemy of the Papists, who pretend that the light of Scripture
   does nothing but dazzle the eyes, in order to keep the simple from
   reading it. But it is no wonder that proud men, inflated with the wind
   of false confidence, do not see that light with which the Lord favors
   only little children and the humble. With a similar eulogy David
   commends the law of God in Psalms 19 and 119.

   20. Knowing this first. Here Peter begins to shew how our minds are to
   be prepared, if we really wish to make progress in scriptural
   knowledge. There may at the same time be two interpretations given, if
   you read epeluseos as some do, which means occurrence, impulse; or, as
   I have rendered it, interpretation, epiluseos. But almost all give this
   meaning, that we ought not to rush on headlong and rashly when we read
   Scripture, confiding in our own understanding. They think that a
   confirmation of this follows, because the Spirit, who spoke by the
   prophets, is the only true interpreter of himself.

   This explanation contains a true, godly, and useful doctrine, that then
   only are the prophecies read profitably, when we renounce the mind and
   feelings of the flesh, and submit to the teaching of the Spirit, but
   that it is an impious profanation of it; when we arrogantly rely on our
   own acumen, deeming that sufficient to enable us to understand it,
   though the mysteries contain things hidden to our flesh, and sublime
   treasures of life far surpassing our capacities. And this is what we
   have said, that the light which shines in it, comes to the humble
   alone.

   But the Papists are doubly foolish, when they conclude from this
   passage, that no interpretation of a private man ought to be deemed
   authoritative. For they pervert what Peter says, that they may claim
   for their own councils the chief right of interpreting Scripture; but
   in this they act indeed childishly; for Peter calls interpretation
   private, not that of every individual, in order to prohibit each one to
   interpret; but he shews that whatever men bring of their own is
   profane. Were, then, the whole world unanimous, and were the minds of
   all men united together, still what would proceed from them, would be
   private or their own; for the word is here set in opposition to divine
   revelation; so that the faithful, inwardly illuminated by the Holy
   Spirit, acknowledge nothing but what God says in his word.

   However, another sense seems to me more simple, that Peter says that
   Scripture came not from man, or through the suggestions of man. For
   thou wilt never come well prepared to read it, except thou bringest
   reverence, obedience, and docility; but a just reverence then only
   exists when we are convinced that God speaks to us, and not mortal men.
   Then Peter especially bids us to believe the prophecies as the
   indubitable oracles of God, because they have not emanated from men's
   own private suggestions. [162]

   To the same purpose is what immediately follows, --

   But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. They
   did not of themselves, or according to their own will, foolishly
   deliver their own inventions. The meaning is, that the beginning of
   right knowledge is to give that credit to the holy prophets which is
   due to God. He calls them the holy men of God, because they faithfully
   executed the office committed to them, having sustained the person of
   God in their ministrations. He says that they were -- not that they
   were bereaved of mind, (as the Gentiles imagined their prophets to have
   been,) but because they dared not to announce anything of their own,
   and obediently followed the Spirit as their guide, who ruled in their
   mouth as in his own sanctuary. Understand by prophecy of Scripture that
   which is contained in the holy Scriptures.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [159] Much has been written on this subject; and the difficulty has
   arisen from a wrong construction of the passage, which is literally as
   follows: -- "And we have more firm the prophetic word," Kai echomen
   bebaioteron ton prophetikon logon, that is, we have rendered more firm
   the prophetic word. This is confirmed by what follows; for the
   prophetic word is compared to "a light shining in a dark place," and,
   therefore, not clear nor firm until it be fulfilled; but they were
   doing well to attend to this light until the full light of the gospel
   shone in their hearts. As Scott maintains, the reference here is
   clearly to the experience of Christians to their real knowledge of
   divine truths; for it was to be in their hearts, and not before their
   eyes A great deal of learning has been spent to no purpose on this
   passage. It has been by most taken as granted, that "the power and
   coming of our Lord," mentioned in verse 16^th, is his second coming,
   when the whole passage refers only and expressly to his first coming.
   And on this gratuitous and even false supposition is grounded the
   elaborate exposition of Sherlock, Horsley, and others. -- Ed.

   [160] There is no command here: the Apostle only approves of what they
   were doing, "whereunto ye do well that ye take heed." -- Ed.

   [161] The Apostle does not speak of the perfect day, but of the dawn of
   it, and the daystar is that which ushers in the perfect day. The gospel
   is the dawn and the daystar, compared with the glimmering light of
   prophecy, and compared too with the perfect day of the heavenly
   kingdom. Prophecy is useful still; for its fulfillment, found in the
   gospel, greatly strengthens faith. -- Ed.

   [162] There are in the main three renderings of this passage: -- l. "No
   Prophecy of Scripture is of a private impulse," or invention; -- 2. "No
   prophecy of Scripture is of self-interpretation," that is, is its own
   interpreter; -- 3. No prophecy of Scripture is of private
   interpretation, that is, is not to be interpreted according to the
   fancies of men, but according to the word of God and the guidance of
   his Spirit. Now which of these corresponds with the context? Clearly
   the first, the two others have nothing in the passage to countenance
   them. The next verse is evidently explanatory of this sentence, which
   seems at once to determine its meaning; and, as it is often the case in
   Scripture, the explanation is given negatively and positively. Prophecy
   did not come from the will of man; it did come from the Spirit of God.
   Besides, the importance attached to the announcement, "knowing this
   especially," is not so clearly borne out as by the first exposition,
   because the fact that prophecy did not come from man, is everything in
   the question, while the other expositions contain only things of
   subordinate importance. Thus what goes before and comes after tends to
   confirm the same view. Whether we take the conjectural reading (which
   only differs from the other in one small letter) or that which is found
   in all the MSS., it may admit of the meaning that has been given. There
   is either an ek, "from," understood, or the word prophecy is to be
   repeated: "No prophecy of Scripture is from one's own explanation;" or,
   "No prophecy of Scripture is a prophecy of one's own explanation," or
   interpretation, that is, as to things to come. Calvin has been followed
   in his view of this passage, among others, by Grotius, Doddridge, and
   Macknight. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Peter 2:1-3

   1. But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
   shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable
   heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon
   themselves swift destruction.

   1. Fuerunt autem et falsi prophetae in populo, sicuti et inter vos
   erunt falsi doctores, qui subinducent sectas perditionis, et etiam
   Dominum qui eos redemit abnegantes, accersentes sibi celerem interitum.

   2. And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the
   way of truth shall be evil spoken of.

   2. Et multi sequentur eorum exitia, per quos via veritatis
   blasphemabitur;

   3. And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
   merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not,
   and their damnation slumbereth not.

   3. Et in avaritia fictis sermonibus de vobis negotiabuntur; quorum
   judicium pridem non cessat, et quorum perditio non dormitat.


   1. But there were. As weak consciences are usually very grievously and
   dangerously shaken, when false teachers arise, who either corrupt or
   mutilate the doctrine of faith, it was necessary for the Apostle, while
   seeking to encourage the faithful to persevere, to remove out of the
   way an offense of this kind. He, moreover, comforted those to whom he
   was writing, and confirmed them by this argument, that God has always
   tried and proved his Church by such a temptation as this, in order that
   novelty might not disturb their hearts. "Not different," he says, "will
   be the condition of the Church under the gospel, from what it was
   formerly under the law; false prophets disturbed the ancient Church;
   the same thing must also be expected by us."

   It was necessary expressly to shew this, because many imagined that the
   Church would enjoy tranquillity under the rein of Christ; for as the
   prophets had promised that at his coming there would be real peace, the
   highest degree of heavenly wisdom, and the full restoration of all
   things, they thought that the Church would be no more exposed to any
   contests. Let us then remember that the Spirit of God hath once for all
   declared, that the Church shall never be free from this intestine evil;
   and let this likeness be always borne in mind, that the trial of our
   faith is to be similar to that of the fathers, and for the same reason
   -- that in this way it may be made evident, whether we really love God,
   as we find it written in Deuteronomy 13:3.

   But it is not necessary here to refer to every example of this kind; it
   is enough, in short, to know that, like the fathers, we must contend
   against false doctrines, that our faith ought by no means to be shaken
   on account of discords and sects, because the truth of God shall remain
   unshaken notwithstanding the violent agitations by which Satan strives
   often to upset all things.

   Observe also, that no one time in particular is mentioned by Peter,
   when he says there shall be false teachers, but that all ages are
   included; for he makes here a comparison between Christians and the
   ancient people. We ought, then, to apply this truth to our own time,
   lest, when we see false teachers rising up to oppose the truth of God,
   this trial should break us down. But the Spirit reminds us, in order
   that we may take the more heed; and to the same purpose is the whole
   description which follows.

   He does not, indeed, paint each sect in its own colors, but
   particularly refers to profane men who manifested contempt towards God.
   The advice, indeed, is general, that we ought to beware of false
   teachers; but, at the same time, he selected one kind of such from whom
   the greater danger arose. What is said here will hereafter become more
   evident from the words of Jude, [Jude 1:4,] who treats exactly of the
   same subject.

   Who privily shall bring in. By these words he points out the craftiness
   of Satan, and of all the ungodly who militate under his banner, that
   they would creep in by oblique turnings, as through burrows under
   ground. [163] The more watchful, then, ought the godly to be, so that
   they may escape their hidden frauds: for however they may insinuate
   themselves, they cannot circumvent those who are carefully vigilant.

   He calls them opinions of perdition, or destructive opinions, that
   every one, solicitous for his salvation, might dread such opinions as
   the most noxious pests. As to the word opinions or heresies, it has
   not, without reason, been always deemed infamous and hateful by the
   children of God; for the bond of holy unity is the simple truth. As
   soon as we depart from that, nothing remains but dreadful discord.

   Even denying the Lord that bought them. Though Christ may be denied in
   various ways, yet Peter, as I think, refers here to what is expressed
   by Jude, that is, when the grace of God is turned into lasciviousness;
   for Christ redeemed us, that he might have a people separated from all
   the pollutions of the world, and devoted to holiness and innocency.
   They, then, who throw off the bridle, and give themselves up to all
   kinds of licentiousness, are not unjustly said to deny Christ by whom
   they have been redeemed. Hence, that the doctrine of the gospel may
   remain whole and complete among us, let this be fixed in our minds,
   that we have been redeemed by Christ, that he may be the Lord of our
   life and of our death, and that our main object ought to be, to live to
   him and to die to him. He then says, that their swift destruction was
   at hand, lest others should be ensnared by them. [164]

   2. And many shall follow. It is, indeed, no slight offense to the weak,
   when they see that false doctrines are received by the common consent
   of the world, that a large number of men are led astray, so that few
   continue in true obedience to Christ. So, at this day, there is nothing
   that more violently disturbs pious minds than such a defection. For
   hardly one in ten of those who have once made a profession of Christ,
   retains the purity of faith to the end. Almost all turn aside into
   corruptions, and being deluded by the teachers of licentiousness, they
   become profane. Lest this should make our faith to falter, Peter comes
   to our help, and in due time foretells that this very thing would be,
   that is, that false teachers would draw many to perdition.

   But there is a double reading even in the Greek copies; for some read,
   "lasciviousness," and others, "perdition." I have, however, followed
   what has been mostly approved. [165]

   By reason of whom the way of truth. This I consider to have been said
   for this reason, because as religion is adorned when men are taught to
   fear God, to maintain uprightness of life, a chaste and virtuous
   conduct, or when at least the mouth of the wicked is closed, that they
   do not speak evil of the gospel; so when the reins are let loose, and
   every kind of licentiousness is practiced, the name and the doctrine of
   Christ are exposed to the reproaches of the ungodly. Others give a
   different explanation -- that these false teachers, like filthy dogs,
   barked at sound doctrine. But the words of Peter appear to me on the
   contrary to intimate, that these would give occasion to enemies
   insolently to assail the truth of God. Though then they would not
   themselves assail the Christian faith with calumnies, yet they would
   arm others with the means of reproaching it.

   3. With feigned words. Peter endeavors by all means to render the
   faithful displeased with ungodly teachers, that they might resist them
   more resolutely and more constantly. It is especially an odious thing
   that we should be exposed to sale like vile slaves. But he testifies
   that this is done, when any one seduces us from the redemption of
   Christ. He calls those feigned words which are artfully formed for the
   purpose of deceiving. [166] Unless then one is so mad as to sell the
   salvation of his soul to false teachers, let him close up every avenue
   that may lead to their wicked inventions. For the same purpose as
   before he repeats again, that their destruction delayed not, that is,
   that he might frighten the good from their society. For since they were
   given up to a sudden destruction, every one who connected himself with
   them, must have perished with them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [163] "Peter intimated that the heresies of which he speaks were to be
   introduced under the color of true doctrine, in the dark. as it were,
   and by little and little; so that the people would not discern their
   real nature." -- Macknight.

   [164] The word here for "Lord" is despotes, which is more expressive of
   power and authority than Kurios, commonly rendered "Lord." This seems
   to intimate the character of the men alluded to: they denied Christ as
   their sovereign, as they rendered no obedience to him, though they may
   have professed to believe in him as a Savior. -- Ed

   [165] Few copies have "perdition," or perditions, for the word is in
   the plural number; and very many have "lasciviousness," and also the
   Vulg. and Syr. versions. Having before mentioned their destructive
   opinions or heresies, which involved the denial of the Lord who bought
   them, he now refers to the immorality which accompanied their false
   doctrines; and that immorality is here referred to is evident from
   this, that the way of truth would be evil spoken of or calumniated. --
   Ed.

   [166] Either "feigned" or "invented" may be meant by plastois: if
   "feigned," then they were words used not conveying their real
   sentiments, but adopted for the purpose of alluring others, as is the
   case with those who pretend great zeal for truth and great love for
   souls, when their object is to gain adherents for filthy lucre's sake.
   But if "invented" be adopted, then logoi must mean narratives or
   fables, -- "invented (or fictitious) fables," or tales. And this is the
   rendering of Macknight. And he says, that the Apostle had probably in
   view the fables concerning the visions of angels and the miracles
   performed at the sepulchres of departed saints, which the false
   teachers in the early ages, and the monks in latter times, fabricated,
   to draw money from the people. Similar are the devices of superstitious
   men, greedy of gain, in every age. -- Ed.

   2 Peter 2:4-8

   4. For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to
   hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto
   judgment;

   4. Si enim Angelis qui peccaverant, Deus non perpercit, sed catenis
   caliginis in tartarum praecipitatos tradidit servandos in judicium;

   5. And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a
   preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the
   ungodly;

   5. Et prisco mundo non pepercit, sed octavum justitiae praeconem Noe
   servavit, diluvio in mundum impiorum inducto;

   6. And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes, condemned
   them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after
   should live ungodly;

   6. Et civitates Sodomorum et Gomorrae in cinerem redactas, subversione
   damnavit, easque statuit exemplum iis qui impia acturi forent;

   7. And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the
   wicked:

   7. Et justum Lot qui opprimebatur à nefariis per libidinosam
   conversationem eripuit;

   8. (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing,
   vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)

   8. Nam oculis et auribus justus ille, quum habitaret inter ipsos
   quotidie animam justam iniquis illorum operibus excruciabat;


   4. For if. We have stated how much it behoves us to know that the
   ungodly, who by their mischievous opinions corrupt the Church, cannot
   escape God's vengeance; and this he proves especially by three
   remarkable examples of God's judgment, -- that he spared not even
   angels, that he once destroyed the whole world by a deluge, that he
   reduced Sodom to ashes, and other neighboring cities. But Peter thought
   it sufficient to take as granted what ought to be never doubted by us,
   that is, that God is the judge of the whole world. It hence follows
   that the punishment he formerly inflicted on the ungodly and wicked, he
   will now also inflict on the like characters. For he can never be
   unlike himself, nor does he shew respect of persons, so as to forgive
   the same wickedness in one which he has punished in another; but he
   hates injustice and wrong equally, whenever it is found. [167]

   For we must always bear in mind that there is a difference between God
   and men; for men indeed judge unequally, but God keeps the same course
   in judging. For that he forgives sins, this is done because he blots
   them out through repentance and faith. He therefore does not otherwise
   reconcile himself to us than by justifying us; for until sin is taken
   away, there is always an occasion of discord between us and Him.

   As to the angels. The argument is from the greater to the less; for
   they were far more excellent than we are, and yet their dignity did not
   preserve them from the hand of God; much less then can mortal men
   escape, when they follow them in their impiety. But as Peter mentions
   here but briefly the fall of angels, and as he has not named the time
   and the manner and other circumstances, it behoves us soberly to speak
   on the subject. Most men are curious and make no end of inquiries on
   these things; but since God in Scripture has only sparingly touched on
   them, and as it were by the way, he thus reminds us that we ought to be
   satisfied with this small knowledge. And indeed they who curiously
   inquire, do not regard edification, but seek to feed their souls with
   vain speculations. What is useful to us, God has made known, that is,
   that the devils were at first created, that they might serve and obey
   God, but that through their own fault they apostatized, because they
   would not submit to the authority of God; and that thus the wickedness
   found in them was accidental, and not from nature, so that it could not
   be ascribed to God.

   All this Peter declares very clearly, when he says that angels fell,
   though superior to men; and Jude is still more express when he writes,
   that they kept not their first estate, or their pre-eminence. [Jude
   1:6.] Let those who are not satisfied with these testimonies have
   recourse to the Sorbonian theology, which will teach them respecting
   angels to satiety, so as to precipitate them to hell together with the
   devils.

   Chains of darkness. This metaphor intimates that they are held bound in
   darkness until the last day. And the comparison is taken from
   malefactors, who, after having been condemned, suffer half of their
   punishment by the severity of the prison, until they are drawn forth to
   their final doom. We may hence learn, not only what punishment the
   wicked suffer after death, but also what is the condition of the
   children of God: for they calmly acquiesce in the hope of sure and
   perfect blessedness, though they do not as yet enjoy it; as the former
   suffer dreadful agonies on account of the vengeance prepared for them.

   5. The old world. The import of what he says is, that God, after having
   drowned the human race, formed again as it were a new world. This is
   also an argument from the greater to the less; for how can the wicked
   escape the deluge of divine wrath, since the whole world was once
   destroyed by it? For by saying that eight only were saved, he intimates
   that a multitude would not be a shield against God to protect the
   wicked; but that as many as sin shall be punished, be they few or many
   in number.

   But it may be asked why he calls Noah the preacher of righteousness.
   Some understand that he was the preacher of the righteousness of God,
   inasmuch as Scripture commends God's righteousness, because he defends
   his own and restores them, when dead, to life. But I rather think that
   he is called the preacher of righteousness, because he labored to
   restore a degenerated world to a sound mind, and this not only by his
   teaching and godly exhortations, but also by his anxious toil in
   building the ark for the term of a hundred and twenty years. Now, the
   design of the Apostle is to set before our eyes God's wrath against the
   wicked, so as to encourage us at the same time to imitate the saints.
   [168]

   6 The cities of Sodom. This was so memorable an example of Divine
   vengeance, that when the Scripture speaks of the universal destruction
   of the ungodly, it alludes commonly to this as the type. Hence Peter
   says, that these cities were made an example. This may, indeed, be
   truly said of others; but Peter points out something singular, because
   it was the chief and a lively image; yea, rather, because the Lord
   designed that his wrath against the ungodly should be made known to all
   ages; as when he redeemed his people from Egypt, he has set forth to us
   by that one favor the perpetual safety of his Church. Jude has also
   expressed the same thing, calling it the punishment of eternal fire.
   [Jude 1:7.]

   8. In seeing and hearing. The common explanation is, that Lot was just
   in his eyes and ears, because all his senses abhorred the crimes of
   Sodom. However, another view may be taken of his seeing and hearing, so
   as to make this the meaning, that when the just man lived among the
   Sodomites, he tormented his soul by seeing and hearing; for we know
   that he was constrained to see and hear many things which greatly vexed
   his mind. The purport of what is said then is, that though the holy man
   was surrounded with every kind of monstrous wickedness, he yet never
   turned aside from his upright course.

   But Peter expresses more than before, that is, that just Lot underwent
   voluntary sorrows; as it is right that all the godly should feel no
   small grief when they see the world rushing into every kind of evil, so
   the more necessary it is that they should groan for their own sins. And
   Peter expressly mentioned this, lest when impiety everywhere prevails,
   we should be captivated and inebriated by the allurements of vices, and
   perish together with others, but that we might prefer this grief,
   blessed by the Lord, to all the pleasures of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [167] The "if" at the beginning of the verse requires a corresponding
   clause. Some, as Piscator and Macknight, supply at the end of the
   seventh verse, "he will not spare thee," or, "will he spare thee?" But
   there is no need of this, the corresponding clause is in the ninth
   verse; and this is our version. The deliverance of the just is there
   first mentioned, as that of Lot was the subject of the previous verse,
   and then the reservation of the unjust for judgment, examples of which
   he had before given. This sort of arrangement is common in Scripture.
   -- Ed.

   [168] There is a difference of opinion as to the word "eighth:" some
   think that the sense is, that Noah was the eighth person who was saved
   at the deluge, being one of the eight who were preserved. Others render
   the words, "Noah, the eighth preacher of righteousness," calculating
   from Enos, in whose time as it is said, "men began to call upon the
   name of the Lord." (Genesis 4:26.) Lightfoot and some others, have held
   the latter opinion, though the former has been more generally approved.

   2 Peter 2:9-11

   9. The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to
   reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:

   9. Novit Dominus pios ex tentatione eripere; injustos autem in diem
   judicii puniendos servare;

   10. But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
   uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled,
   they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.

   10. Praesertim verò eos qui post carnem in concupiscentia pollutionis
   ambulant, dominationem despiciunt, audaces, praefracti, qui
   excellentias non verentur probro afficere;

   11. Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not
   railing accusation against them before the Lord.

   11. Quum angeli, qui sunt robore et potentia majores, non ferant
   adversus illas coram Domino contumeliosum judicium.


   9. The Lord knoweth. What first offends the weak is, that when the
   faithful anxiously seek aid, they are not immediately helped by God;
   but on the contrary he suffers them sometimes as it were to pine away
   through daily weariness and languor; and secondly, when the wicked grow
   wanton with impunity and God in the meantime is silent, as though he
   connived at their evil deeds. This double offense Peter now removes;
   for he testifies that the Lord knows when it is expedient to deliver
   the godly from temptation. By these words he reminds us that this
   office ought to be left to him, and that therefore we ought to endure
   temptations, and not to faint, when at any time he defers his vengeance
   against the ungodly.

   This consolation is very necessary for us, for this thought is apt to
   creep in, "If the Lord would have his own to be safe, why does he not
   gather them all into some corner of the earth, that they may mutually
   stimulate one another to holiness? why does he mingle them with the
   wicked by whom they may be defiled?" But when God claims to himself the
   office of helping, and protecting his own, that they may not fail in
   the contest, we gather courage to fight more strenuously. The meaning
   of the first clause is, that this law is prescribed by the Lord to all
   the godly, that they are to be proved by various temptations, but that
   they are to entertain good hope of success, because they are never to
   be deprived of his aid and help.

   And to reserve the unjust. By this clause he shews that God so
   regulates his judgments as to bear with the wicked for a time, but not
   to leave them unpunished. Thus he corrects too much haste, by which we
   are wont to be carried headlong, especially when the atrocity of
   wickedness grievously wounds us, for we then wish God to fulminate
   without delay; when he does not do so, he seems no longer to be the
   judge of the world. Lest, then, this temporary impunity of wickedness
   should disturb us, Peter reminds us that a day of judgment has been
   appointed by the Lord; and that, therefore, the wicked shall by no
   means escape punishment, though it be not immediately inflicted.

   There is an emphasis in the word reserve, as though he had said, that
   they shall not escape the hand of God, but be held bound as it were by
   hidden chains, that they may at a certain time be drawn forth to
   judgment. The participle kolazomenous, though in the present tense, is
   yet to be thus explained, that they are reserved or kept to be
   punished, or, that they may be punished. For he bids us to rely on the
   expectation of the last judgment, so that in hope and patience we may
   fight till the end of life.

   10. But chiefly them. He comes here to particulars, accommodating a
   general doctrine to his own purpose; for he had to do with men of
   desperate wickedness. He then shews that dreadful vengeance necessarily
   awaited them. For since God will punish all the wicked, how can they
   escape who abandon themselves like brute beasts to every kind of
   iniquity? To walk after the flesh, is to be given up to the flesh, like
   brute animals, who are not led by reason and judgment, but have the
   natural desire of their flesh as their chief guide. By the lust of
   uncleanness understand filthy and unbridled gratifications, when men,
   having cast away every virtuous feeling, and shaken off shame, are
   carried away into every uncleanness.

   This is the first mark by which he brands them, that they are impure
   men, given up to wickedness. Other marks follow, that they despised
   government, and feared not to calumniate and reproach men whom God had
   favored with honorable stations in life. But these words refer to the
   same thing; for after having said that they held government in
   contempt, he immediately points out the fountain of this evil, that
   they were presumptuous, or audacious, and self-willed, or refractory;
   [169] and lastly, that he might more fully exhibit their pride, he says
   that they did not fear nor tremble when they treated dignities with
   contempt. For it is a monstrous arrogance to regard as nothing the
   glory which shines forth in dignities appointed by God.

   But there is no doubt but that in these words he refers to the imperial
   and magisterial power; for though there is no lawful station in life
   which is not worthy of respect, yet we know that the magisterial office
   excels every other, because in governing mankind God himself is
   represented. Then truly glorious is that power in which God himself
   appears.

   We now perceive what the Apostle meant in this second clause, even that
   they of whom he speaks were frantic men, lovers of tumults and
   confusion; for no one can introduce anarchy (anarchian) into the world
   without introducing disorder (ataxian.) Now, these with bold effrontery
   vomited forth reproaches against magistrates, that they might take away
   every respect for public rights; and this was openly to fight against
   God by their blasphemies. There are also many turbulent men of this
   sort at the present day, who proudly declare that the power of the
   sword is heathen and unlawful, and furiously attempt to subvert all
   government. Such furies Satan excites, in order to disturb and prevent
   the progress of the gospel. But the Lord hath dealt favorably with us;
   for he hath not only warned us to beware of this deadly poison, but
   hath also by this ancient example fortified us against this scandal.
   Hence the Papists act very dishonestly, when they accuse us, and say
   that seditious men are made so by our doctrine. The same thing might
   indeed have been alleged against the apostles formerly; and yet they
   were as far as possible from encouraging any such wickedness.

   11. Whereas angels. He hence shews their rash arrogance, because they
   dared to assume more liberty than even angels. But it seems strange
   that he says that angels do not bring a railing accusation against
   magistrates; for why should they be adverse to that sacred order, the
   author of which they know to be God? Why should they oppose rulers whom
   they know to be exercising the same ministry with themselves? This
   reasoning has made some to think that the devils are meant; but they do
   not thus by any means escape the difficulty. For how could Satan be so
   moderate as to spare men, since he is the author of every blasphemy
   against God? And further, their opinion is refuted by what Jude says.
   [Jude 1:9.]

   But when we consider the circumstances of the time, what is said
   applies very suitably to holy angels. For all the magistrates were then
   ungodly, and bloody enemies to the gospel. They must, therefore, have
   been hateful to angels, the guardians of the Church. He, however, says,
   that men deserving hatred and execration, were not condemned by them in
   order that they might shew respect to a power divinely appointed. While
   such moderation, he says, is shewn by angels, these men fearlessly give
   vent to impious and unbridled blasphemies.

   2 Peter 2:12-16

   12. But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed,
   speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly
   perish in their own corruption;

   12. Isti autem tanquam bruta animalia, naturaliter genita in capturam
   et perniciem, in quibus nihil intelligunt maledicentes, in sua
   corruptione peribunt

   13. And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count
   it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes,
   sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with
   you;

   13. Recipientes mercedem injustitiae, pro voluptate ducentes in diem
   frui deliciis, labes et maculae, deliciantes in erroribus suis,
   conviventes vobiscum;

   14. Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin;
   beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous
   practices; cursed children:

   14. Oculos habentes plenos adulterae, et inquietos ad peccandum,
   inescantes animas instabiles, cor habentes exercitatum cupiditatibus,
   execrabiles: filii;

   15. Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following
   the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of
   unrighteousness;

   15. Qui relicta via aberraverunt, sequuti viam Balaam, filii Bozor, qui
   mercedem injustitiae dilexit;

   16. But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's
   voice forbade the madness of the prophet.

   16. Sed redargutus fuit de sua iniquitate; animal subjugale mutum,
   humana voce loquens, prohibuit prophetae dementiam. (Numbers 23:16,
   28.)


   12. But these. He proceeds with what he had begun to say respecting
   impious and wicked corrupters. And, first, he condemns their loose
   manners and the obscene wickedness of their whole life; and then he
   says that they were audacious and perverse, so that by their scurrilous
   garrulity they insinuated themselves into the favor of many.

   He especially compares them to those brute animals, which seem to have
   come to existence to be ensnared, and to be driven to their own ruin by
   their own instinct; as though he had said, that being induced by no
   allurements, they of themselves hasten to throw themselves into the
   snares of Satan and of death. For what we render, naturally born, Peter
   has literally, "natural born." But there is not much difference in the
   sense, whether one of the two has been by somebody else supplied, or by
   putting down both he meant more fully to express his meaning. [170]

   What he adds, speaking evil of the things that they understand not,
   refers to the pride and presumption he mentioned in the preceding
   verse. He then says that all excellency was insolently despised by
   them, because they were become wholly stupefied, so that they differed
   nothing from beasts. But the word I have rendered for destruction, and
   afterwards in corruption, is the same, phthora; but it is variously
   taken: but when he says that they would perish in their own corruption,
   he shews that their corruptions would be ruinous or destructive.

   13. Count it pleasure [171] As though he had said, "They place their
   happiness in their present enjoyments." We know that men excel brute
   animals in this, that they extend their thoughts much farther. It is,
   then, a base thing in man to be occupied only with present things. Here
   he reminds us that our minds ought to be freed from the gratifications
   of the flesh, except we wish to be reduced to the state of beasts.

   The meaning of what follows is this, "These are filthy spots to you and
   your assembly; for while they feast with you, they at the same time
   luxuriate in their errors, and shew by their eyes and gestures their
   lascivious lusts and detestable incontinency." Erasmus has rendered the
   words thus, "Feasting in their errors, they deride you." But this is
   too forced. It may not unaptly be thus explained, "Feasting with you,
   they insolently deride you by their errors." I, however, have given the
   version which seems the most probable, "luxuriating in their errors,
   feasting with you." He calls the libidinous such as had eyes full of
   adultery, and who were incessantly led to sin without restraint, as it
   appears from what is afterwards said.

   14. Beguiling, or baiting, unstable souls. By the metaphor of baiting
   he reminds the faithful to beware of their hidden and deceitful arts;
   for he compares their impostures to hooks which may catch the unwary to
   their destruction. By adding unstable souls he shews the reason for
   caution, that is, when we have not struck firm roots in faith and in
   the fear of the Lord: and he intimates at the same time, that they have
   no excuse who suffer themselves to be baited or lured by such
   flatteries; for this must have been ascribed to their levity. Let there
   be then a stability of faith, and we shall be safe from the artifices
   of the ungodly.

   An heart they have exercised with covetous practices, or, with lusts.
   Erasmus renders the last word, "rapines." The word is of a doubtful
   meaning. I prefer "lusts." As he had before condemned incontinence in
   their eyes, so he now seems to refer to the vices latent in their
   hearts. It ought not, however, to be confined to covetousness. By
   calling them cursed or execrable children, he may be understood to
   mean, that they were so either actively or passively, that is, that
   they brought a curse with them wherever they went, or that they
   deserved a curse.

   As he has hitherto referred to the injury they did by the example of a
   perverse and corrupt life, so he again repeats, that they spread by
   their teaching the deadly poison of impiety, in order that they might
   destroy the simple. He compares them to Balaam, the son of Bozor, who
   employed a venal tongue to curse God's people. And to shew that they
   were not worthy of a long refutation, he says that Balaam was reproved
   by an ass, and that thus his madness was condemned. But by this means
   also he restrains the faithful from associating with them. For it was a
   dreadful judgment of God, that the angel made himself known to the ass
   before he did to the prophet, so that the ass, perceiving God
   displeased, dared not to advance farther, but went back, when the
   prophet, under the blind impulse of his own avarice, pushed forward
   against the evident prohibition of the Lord. For what was afterwards
   answered to him, that he was to proceed, was an evidence of God's
   indignation rather than a permission. In short, as the greatest
   indignity to him, the mouth of the ass was opened, that he who had been
   unwilling to submit to God's authority might have that as his teacher.
   And by this miracle the Lord designed to shew how monstrous a thing it
   was to change the truth to a lie.

   It may be here asked, by what right Balaam had the name of a prophet,
   when it appears that he was addicted to many wicked superstitions. To
   this I reply, that the gift of prophecy was so special, that though he
   did not worship the true God, and had not true religion, he might yet
   have been endued with it. Besides, God has sometimes caused prophecy to
   exist in the midst of idolatry, in order that men might have less
   excuse.

   Now, if any one considers the chief things which Peter says, he will
   see that his warning is equally suitable to the present age; for it is
   an evil which prevails everywhere, that men use scurrilous raillery for
   the purpose of deriding God and the Savior; nay, they ridicule all
   religion under the cloak of wit; and when addicted, like beasts, to
   their own lusts, they will mingle with the faithful; they prattle
   something about the gospel, and yet they prostitute their tongue to the
   service of the devil, that they may bring the whole world, as far as
   they can, to eternal perdition. They are in this respect worse than
   Balaam himself, because they gratuitously pour forth their
   maledictions, when he, induced by reward, attempted to curse.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [170] The words may be thus rendered, -- "But these, as natural
   unreasoning animals, born for capture and destruction, speaking evil of
   things which they understand not, shall utterly perish through their
   own corruption." They are compared to animals which are by nature
   without reason, and such as live on prey, wild and rapacious, which
   seem to have been made to be taken and destroyed; and they are often
   taken and destroyed while committing plunder. So these men, their
   wickedness would be the means of ensnaring and destroying them. -- Ed.

   [171] It is better to connect the first words of this verse, "receiving
   the reward of unrigrhteousness," with the foregoing, and to begin
   another period with this clause, and to render this verse and the
   following thus, -- "Counting (or, deeming) riot in the day-time a
   pleasure, they are spots and stains, rioting in their own delusions,
   feasting together with (14) you; having eyes full of adultery and which
   cease not from sin, ensnaring unstable souls, having a heart inured to
   covetous desires, being children of the curse." The various things said
   of them are intended to shew that they were "spots and stains,"
   disgraceful and defiling: they rioted in carnal pleasure, and rioted in
   delusion, and associated with the faithful, feasting with them; they
   were libidinous, and led unstable souls to follow their ways; they were
   covetous, and shewed that they were heirs to the curse of God. -- Ed.

   2 Peter 2:17-19

   17. These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
   tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.

   17. Ii sunt fontes sine aqua, nebulae quae turbine aguntur; quibus
   caligo tenebrarum in aeternum parata est.

   18. For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure
   through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that
   were clean escaped from them who live in error.

   18. Nam ubi plusqum fastuosa vanitatis verba sonuerint, inescant per
   concupiscentias carnis, lasciviis, eos qui verè aufugerant ab iis qui
   in errore versantur.

   19. While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants
   of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought
   in bondage.

   19. Dum libertatem illis promittunt, quum ipsi sint servi corruptionis:
   a quo enim quis superatus est, huie in servitutem est addictus.


   17. These are wells, or fountains, without water. He shews by these two
   metaphors, that they had nothing within, though they made a great
   display. A fountain, by its appearance, draws men to itself, because it
   promises them water to drink, and for other purposes; as soon as clouds
   appear, they give hope of immediate rain to irrigate the earth. He then
   says that they were like fountains, because they excelled in boasting,
   and displayed some acuteness in their thoughts and elegance in their
   words; but that yet they were dry and barren within: hence the
   appearance of a fountain was fallacious.

   He says that they were clouds carried by the wind, either without rain,
   or which burst forth into a calamitous storm. He thereby denotes that
   they brought nothing useful, and that often they were very hurtful. He
   afterwards denounces on them the dreadful judgment of God, that fear
   might restrain the faithful. By naming the mist or the blackness of
   darkness, he alludes to the clouds which obscure the air; as though he
   had said, that for the momentary darkness which they now spread, there
   is prepared for them a much thicker darkness which is to continue for
   ever.

   18. For when they speak great swelling words of vanity. [172] He means
   that they dazzled the eyes of the simple by high-flown stuff of words,
   that they might not perceive their deceit, for it was not easy to
   captivate their minds with such dotages, except they were first
   besotted by some artifice. He then says that they used an inflated kind
   of words and speech, that they might fill the unwary with admiration.
   And then this grandiloquence, which the ample lungs of the soul send
   forth, (as Persius says, [173] ) was very suitable to cover their
   shifts and trumperies. There was formerly a craft of this kind in
   Valentinus, and in those like him, as we learn from the books of
   Irenaeus. They made words unheard of before, by the empty sound of
   which, the unlearned being smitten, they were ensnared by their
   reveries.

   There are fanatics of a similar kind at this day, who call themselves
   by the plausible title of Libertines or free-men. For they talk most
   confidently of the Spirit and of spiritual things, as though they
   roared out from above the clouds, and fascinate many by their tricks
   and wiles, so that you may say that the Apostle has correctly
   prophesied of them. For they treat all things jocosely and scoffingly;
   and though they are great simpletons, yet as they indulge in all vices,
   they find favor with their own people by a sort of drollery. The state
   of the case is this, that when the difference between good and evil is
   removed, everything becomes lawful; and men, loosed from all subjection
   to laws, obey their own lusts. This Epistle, therefore, is not a little
   suitable to our age.

   They allure, or bait, through the lusts of the flesh. He strikingly
   compares to hooks the allurements of the ungodly, when they make
   anything they please lawful; for as the lusts of men are headstrong and
   craving, as soon as liberty is offered, they lay hold on it with great
   avidity; but soon afterwards the strangling hook within is perceived.
   But we must consider the whole sentence of the Apostle.

   He says that they who had really escaped from the society of those in
   error were again deceived by a new kind of error, even when the reins
   were let loose to them for the indulgence of every sort of
   intemperance. He hereby reminds us how dangerous are the wiles of these
   men. For it was already a dreadful thing that blindness and thick
   darkness possessed almost all mankind. It was, therefore, in a manner a
   double prodigy, that men, freed from the common errors of the world,
   should, after having received the light of God, be brought back to a
   beastly indifference. Let us be reminded of what we ought especially to
   beware of, after having been once enlightened, that is, lest Satan
   entice us under the pretense of liberty, so as to give ourselves up to
   lasciviousness to gratify the lusts of the flesh. But they are safe
   from this danger who seriously attend to the study of holiness.

   19. While they promise them liberty. He shews their inconsistency, that
   they falsely promised liberty, while they themselves served sin, and
   were in the worst bondage; for no one can give what he has not. This
   reason, however, does not seem to be sufficiently valid, because it
   sometimes happens that wicked men, and wholly unacquainted with Christ,
   preach usefully concerning the benefits and blessings of Christ. But we
   must observe, that what is condemned here is vicious doctrine,
   connected with impurity of life; for the Apostle's design was to
   obviate the deceptive allurements by which they ensnared the foolish.
   The name of liberty is sweet, and they abused it for this end, that the
   hearer, being loosed from the fear of the divine law, might abandon
   himself unto unbridled licentiousness. But the liberty which Christ has
   procured for us, and which he offers daily by the gospel, is altogether
   different, for he has exempted us from the yoke of the law as far as it
   subjects us to a curse, that he might also deliver us from the dominion
   of sin, as far as it subjects us to its own lusts. Hence, where lusts
   reign, and therefore where the flesh rules, there the liberty of Christ
   has no place whatever. The Apostle then declares this to all the godly,
   that they might not desire any other liberty but that which leads
   those, who are set free from sin, to a willing obedience to
   righteousness.

   We hence learn that there have ever been depraved men who made a false
   pretense to liberty, and that this has been an old cunning trick of
   Satan. We need not wonder that at this day the same filth is stirred up
   by fanatical men.

   The Papists turn and twist this passage against us, but they thereby
   betray their ridiculous impudence. For in the first place, men of the
   filthiest life, in public-houses and brothels, belch out this charge,
   that we are the servants of corruption, in the life of whom they cannot
   point out anything reproachful. In the second place, since we teach
   nothing respecting Christian liberty but what is derived from Christ
   and his Apostles, and at the same time require the mortification of the
   flesh, and the proper exercises for subduing it, much more strictly
   than they do who slander us, they vomit forth their curses, not so much
   against us as against the Son of God, whom we have as our certain
   teacher and authority.

   For of whom a man is overcome. This sentence is derived from military
   law; but yet it is a common saying among heathen writers, that there is
   no harder or a more miserable bondage than when lusts rule and reign.
   What then ought to be done by us, on whom the Son of God has bestowed
   his Spirit, not only that we may be freed from the dominion of sin, but
   that we may also become the conquerors of the flesh and the world?

   [172] The words are, -- "For uttering bombasts of vanity, they allure,"
   etc. The word uperonka, being a neuter plural, may be rendered as a
   noun; literally, "overswellings of vanity;" but when applied to words,
   it means what is pompous, inflated, bombastic; but these bombasts were
   those of vanity, being empty, useless, unprofitable; or as some render
   the words, they were the bombasts of falsehood, according to the
   meaning of the word as used often in the Sept.; they spoke false things
   in a bombastic and inflated strain. -- Ed.

   2 Peter 2:20-22

   20. For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through
   the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again
   entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than
   the beginning.

   20. Nam si ii qui sufugerant ab inquinamentis mundi per cognitionem
   Domini et Servatoris Jesu Christi, rursum iisdem impliciti superantur,
   facta sunt illis postrema pejora prioribus.

   21. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
   righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy
   commandment delivered unto them.

   21. Melius enim ipsis esset non cognovisse viam justitiae, qum ubi
   cognoverunt converti ab eo, quod illis traditum fuit, sancto praecepto.

   22. But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog
   is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her
   wallowing in the mire.

   22. Sed accidit illis quod vero proverbio dicitur, Canis reversus ad
   proprium vomitum; et sus lota, ad volutabrum coeni.


   20. For if after. He again shews how pernicious was the sect which led
   men consecrated to God back again to their old filth and the
   corruptions of the world. And he exhibits the heinousness of the evil
   by a comparison; for it was no common sin to depart from the holy
   doctrine of God. It would have been better for them, he says, not to
   have known the way of righteousness; for though there is no excuse for
   ignorance, yet the servant who knowingly and wilfully despises the
   commands of his lord, deserves a twofold punishment. There was besides
   ingratitude, because they wilfully extinguished the light of God,
   rejected the favor conferred on them, and having shaken off the yoke,
   became perversely wanton against God; yea, as far as they could, they
   profaned and abrogated the inviolable covenant of God, which had been
   ratified by the blood of Christ. The more earnest then ought we to be,
   to advance humbly and carefully in the course of our calling. We must
   now consider each sentence.

   By naming the pollutions of the world, he shews that we roll in filth
   and are wholly polluted, until we renounce the world. By the knowledge
   of Christ he no doubt understands the gospel. He testifies that the
   design of it is, to deliver us from the defilements of the world, and
   to lead us far away from them. For the same reason he afterwards calls
   it the way of righteousness. He then alone makes a right progress in
   the gospel who faithfully learns Christ; and he truly knows Christ, who
   has been taught by him to put off the old man and to put on the new
   man, as Paul reminds us in Ephesians 4:22 [174]

   21. By saying that having forsaken the commandment delivered unto them,
   they returned to their own pollutions, he intimates first, how
   inexcusable they were; and secondly, he reminds us that the doctrine of
   a holy and virtuous life, though common to all and indiscriminately
   belonging to all, is yet peculiarly taught to those whom God favors
   with the light of his gospel. But he declares that they who make
   themselves slaves again to the pollutions of the world fall away from
   the gospel. The faithful also do indeed sin; but as they allow not
   dominion to sin, they do not fall away from the grace of God, nor do
   they renounce the profession of sound doctrine which they have once
   embraced. For they are not to be deemed conquered, while they
   strenuously resist the flesh and its lusts.

   22. But it has happened unto them. As the example disturbs many, when
   men who had submitted to the obedience of Christ, rush headlong into
   vices without fear or shame, the Apostle, in order to remove the
   offense, says that this happens through their own fault, and that
   because they are pigs and dogs. It hence follows that no part of the
   sin can be ascribed to the gospel.

   For this purpose he quotes two ancient proverbs, the first of which is
   found as the saying of Solomon in Proverbs 26:11. But what Peter meant
   is briefly this, that the gospel is a medicine which purges us by
   wholesome vomiting, but that there are many dogs who swallow again what
   they have vomited to their own ruin; and that the gospel is also a
   laver which cleanses all our uncleanness, but that there are many swine
   who, immediately after washing, roll themselves again in the mud. At
   the same time the godly are reminded to take heed to themselves, except
   they wish to be deemed dogs or swine.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [174] The end of this verse is not explained, but the words of the
   version, facta sunt illis postrema pejora prioribus, seem to mean, that
   their last pollutions would become worse to them than their former
   pollutions; and this is the rendering of Macknight. The sentence is
   commonly taken in the same sense as in Matthew 12:45, but the words are
   somewhat different. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Peter 3:1-4

   1. This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I
   stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:

   1. Hane jam, dilecti, secundam vobis scribo epistolam, in quibus excito
   per commonefactionem vestram puram mentem;

   2. That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the
   holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord
   and Saviour:

   2. Ut memores sitis verborum quae predicta sunt a sanctis prophetis, et
   praecepti nostri, qui sumus apostoli Domini et Servatoris;

   3. Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers,
   walking after their own lusts,

   3. Hoc primum scientes, quòd venient in extremo dierum illusores,
   secundum suas ipsorum concupiscentias ambulantes,

   4. And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
   fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
   beginning of the creation.

   4. Ac dicentes, Ubi est promissio adventus ejus? Ex quo enim patres
   dormierunt, omnia sic permanent ab initio creationis.


   1. Lest they should be wearied with the Second Epistle as though the
   first was sufficient, he says that it was not written in vain, because
   they stood in need of being often stirred up. To make this more
   evident, he shews that they could not be beyond danger, except they
   were well fortified, because they would have to contend with desperate
   men, who would not only corrupt the purity of the faith, by false
   opinions, but do what they could to subvert entirely the whole faith.

   By saying, I stir up your pure mind, he means the same as though he had
   said, "I wish to awaken you to a sincerity of mind." And the words
   ought to be thus explained, "I stir up your mind that it may be pure
   and bright." For the meaning is, that the minds of the godly become
   dim, and as it were contract rust, when admonitions cease. But we also
   hence learn, that men even endued with learning, become, in a manner,
   drowsy, except they are stirred up by constant warnings. [175]

   It now appears what is the use of admonitions, and how necessary they
   are; for the sloth of the flesh smothers the truth once received, and
   renders it inefficient, except the goads of warnings come to its aid.
   It is not then enough, that men should be taught to know what they
   ought to be, but there is need of godly teachers, to do this second
   part, deeply to impress the truth on the memory of their hearers. And
   as men are, by nature, for the most part, fond of novelty and thus
   inclined to be fastidious, it is useful for us to bear in mind what
   Peter says, so that we may not only willingly suffer ourselves to be
   admonished by others, but that every one may also exercise himself in
   calling to mind continually the truth, so that our minds may become
   resplendent with the pure and clear knowledge of it.

   2. That ye may be mindful. By these words he intimates that we have
   enough in the writings of the prophets, and in the gospel, to stir us
   up, provided we be as diligent as it behoves us, in meditating on them;
   and that our minds sometimes contract a rust, or become bedimmed
   through darkness, is owing to our sloth. That God may then continually
   shine upon us, we must devote ourselves to that study: let our faith at
   the same time acquiesce in witnesses so certain and credible. For when
   we have the prophets and apostles agreeing with us, nay, as the
   ministers of our faith, and God as the author, and angels as approvers,
   there is no reason that the ungodly, all united, should move us from
   our position. By the commandment of the apostles he means the whole
   doctrine in which they had instructed the faithful. [176]

   3. Knowing this first. The participle knowing may be applied to the
   Apostle, and in this way, "I labor to stir you up for this reason,
   because I know what and how great is your impending danger from
   scoffers." I however prefer this explanation, that the participle is
   used in place of a verb, as though he had said, "Know ye this
   especially." For it was necessary that this should have been foretold,
   because they might have been shaken, had impious men attacked them
   suddenly with scoffs of this kind. He therefore wished them to know
   this, and to feel assured on the subject, that they might be prepared
   to oppose such men.

   But he calls the attention of the faithful again to the doctrine which
   he touched upon in the second chapter. For by the last days is commonly
   meant the kingdom of Christ, or the days of his kingdom, according to
   what Paul says, "Upon whom the ends of the world are come." (1
   Corinthians 10:11.) [177] The meaning is, that the more God offers
   himself by the gospel to the world, and the more he invites men to his
   kingdom, the more audacious on the other hand will ungodly men vomit
   forth the poison of their impiety.

   He calls those scoffers, according to what is usual in Scripture, who
   seek to appear witty by shewing contempt to God, and by a blasphemous
   presumption. It is, moreover, the very extremity of evil, when men
   allow themselves to treat the awful name of God with scoffs. Thus, the
   first Psalm speaks of the seat of scoffers. So David, in Psalms 119:51,
   complains that he was derided by the proud, because he attended to
   God's law. So Isaiah, in the 28th chapter, having referred to them,
   describes their supine security and insensibility. Let us therefore
   bear in mind, that there is nothing to be feared more than a contest
   with scoffers. On this subject we said something while explaining the
   third chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians. As, however, the Holy
   Scripture has foretold that they would come, and has also given us a
   shield by which we may defend ourselves, there is no excuse why we
   should not boldly resist them whatever devices they may employ.

   4. Where is the promise. It was a dangerous scoff when they insinuated
   a doubt as to the last resurrection; for when that is taken away, there
   is no gospel any longer, the power of Christ is brought to nothing, the
   whole of religion is gone. Then Satan aims directly at the throat of
   the Church, when he destroys faith in the coming of Christ. For why did
   Christ die and rise again, except that he may some time gather to
   himself the redeemed from death, and give them eternal life? All
   religion is wholly subverted, except faith in the resurrection remains
   firm and immovable. Hence, on this point Satan assails us most
   fiercely.

   But let us notice what the scoff was. They set the regular course of
   nature, such as it seems to have been from the beginning, in opposition
   to the promise of God, as though these things were contrary, or did not
   harmonize together. Though the faith of the fathers, they said, was the
   same, yet no change has taken place since their death, and it is known
   that many ages have passed away. Hence they concluded that what was
   said of the destruction of the world was a fable; because they
   conjectured, that as it had lasted so long, it would be perpetual.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [175] The Apostle evidently admits that they had a sincere or a pure
   mind, that is, freed from the pollutions referred to in the last
   chapter; but still they stood in need of being stirred up by
   admonitions: hence their minds were not, in a strict sense, perfect,
   though sincere. -- Ed.

   [176] The construction of the passage is as follows: -- "In both which
   I, by admonition, arouse your sincere mind to remember the words,
   aforetime spoken by the holy prophets, and the doctrine of us, the
   apostles of our Lord and Savior." The verb mnesthonai is connected with
   "arouse;" and it is in this tense used actively as well as passively.
   See Matthew 26:75, and Acts 10:31. There is in the noun entole, a
   metonymy, the commandment for what was commanded to be taught, the
   doctrine. It has this meaning, according to Schleusner, in John 12:50,
   and in this Epistle, chapter 2:21. -- Ed

   [177] It is literally, "the last of the days," according to the Hebrew
   form 'chryt hymym, "the extremity of the days," (Isaiah 2:2;) but the
   meaning is the same as "the last days," as used in Hebrews 1:2, and in
   other places, that is, the days of the gospel dispensation. -- Ed.

   2 Peter 3:5-8

   5. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the
   heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the
   water:

   5. Nam hoe nesciunt volentes. quòd caeli jam olim fuerint, et terra ex
   aqua, et per aquam consistens, Dei sermone;

   6. Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
   perished:

   6. Per quae mundus qui tunc erat, aqua inundatus periit:

   7. But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are
   kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
   perdition of ungodly men.

   7. Qui autem nunc sunt coeli et terra, ejusdem sermone repositi sunt,
   et servantur igni in diem judicii et perditionis impiorum.

   8. But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is
   with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

   8. Porri, ne hoc unum nos lateat, dilecti, quòd unus dies apud Dominum
   perinde est ut mille anni, et mille anni ut dies unus.


   5. For this they willingly are ignorant of. By one argument only he
   confutes the scoff of the ungodly, even by this, that the world once
   perished by a deluge of waters, when yet it consisted of waters.
   (Genesis 1:2.) And as the history of this was well known, he says that
   they willingly, or of their own accord, erred. For they who infer the
   perpetuity of the world from its present state, designedly close their
   eyes, so as not to see so clear a judgment of God. The world no doubt
   had its origin from waters, for Moses calls the chaos from which the
   earth emerged, waters; and further, it was sustained by waters; it yet
   pleased the Lord to use waters for the purpose of destroying it. It
   hence appears that the power of nature is not sufficient to sustain and
   preserve the world, but that on the contrary it contains the very
   element of its own ruin, whenever it may please God to destroy it.

   For it ought always to be borne in mind, that the world stands through
   no other power than that of God's word, and that therefore inferior or
   secondary causes derive from him their power, and produce different
   effects as they are directed. Thus through water the world stood, but
   water could have done nothing of itself, but on the contrary obeyed
   God's word as an inferior agent or element. As soon then as it pleased
   God to destroy the earth, the same water obeyed in becoming a ruinous
   inundation. We now see how egregiously they err, who stop at naked
   elements, as though there was perpetuity in them, and their nature were
   not changeable according to the bidding of God.

   By these few words the petulance of those is abundantly refuted, who
   arm themselves with physical reasons to fight against God. For the
   history of the deluge is an abundantly sufficient witness that the
   whole order of nature is governed by the sole power of God. (Genesis
   7:17.)

   It seems, however, strange that he says that the world perished through
   the deluge, when he had before mentioned the heaven and the earth. To
   this I answer, that the heaven was then also submerged, that is, the
   region of the air, which stood open between the two waters. For the
   division or separation, mentioned by Moses, was then confounded.
   (Genesis 1:6;) and the word heaven is often taken in this sense. if any
   wishes for more on this subject, let him read Augustine on the City of
   God. Lib. 20. [178]

   7. But the heavens and the earth which are now. He does not infer this
   as the consequence; for his purpose was no other than to dissipate the
   craftiness of scoffers respecting the perpetual state of nature, and we
   see many such at this day who being slightly embued with the rudiments
   of philosophy, only hunt after profane speculations, in order that they
   may pass themselves off as great philosophers.

   But it now appears quite evident from what has been said, that there is
   nothing unreasonable in the declaration made by the Lord, that the
   heaven and the earth shall hereafter be consumed by fire, because the
   reason for the fire is the same as that for the water. For it was a
   common saying even among the ancients, that from these two chief
   elements all things have proceeded. But as he had to do with the
   ungodly, he speaks expressly of their destruction.

   8. But be not ignorant of this one thing. He now turns to speak to the
   godly; and he reminds them that when the coming of Christ is the
   subject, they were to raise upwards their eyes, for by so doing, they
   would not limit, by their unreasonable wishes, the time appointed by
   the Lord. For waiting seems very long on this account, because we have
   our eyes fixed on the shortness of the present life, and we also
   increase weariness by computing days, hours, and minutes. But when the
   eternity of God's kingdom comes to our minds, many ages vanish away
   like so many moments.

   This then is what the Apostle calls our attention to, so that we may
   know that the day of resurrection does not depend on the present flow
   of time, but on the hidden purpose of God, as though he had said, "Men
   wish to anticipate God for this reason, because they measure time
   according to the judgment of their own flesh; and they are by nature
   inclined to impatience, so that celerity is even delay to them: do ye
   then ascend in your minds to heaven, and thus time will be to you
   neither long nor short."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [178] The two verses, the fifth and the sixth, have been differently
   explained. "The earth," say some, "subsisting from water and through
   water," that is, emerging from water and made firm and solid by means
   of water; which is true, for through moisture the earth adheres
   together and becomes a solid mass. Others render the last clause, "in
   water," or in the midst of water, that is, surrounded by water; and
   this is the most suitable meaning. The di ' hon at the beginning of the
   sixth verse, refers, according to Beza, Whitby, and others, to the
   heavens and the earth in the preceding verse, the deluge being
   occasioned by "the windows of heaven being opened," and "the fountains
   of the great deep being broken up." (Genesis 7:11.) "By which (or by
   the means of which) the world at that time, being overflowed with
   water, was destroyed." The objection to this view is, as justly stated
   by Macknight, that the correspondence between this verse and the
   following is thereby lost: the reservation of the world to be destroyed
   by fire is expressly ascribed, in verse seventh, to God's word; and to
   the same ought the destruction of the old world to be ascribed. This is
   doubtless the meaning required by the passage, but "which" being in the
   plural, creates a difficulty, and there is no different reading.
   Macknight solves the difficulty by saying that the plural "which" or
   whom, refers to "word," meaning Christ, and "God," as in the first
   verse of this chapter, "in both which," a reference is made to what is
   implied in "the second Epistle," that is, the first. He supposes that
   there is here the same anomalous mode of speaking. But the conjecture
   which has been made is not improbable, that it is a typographical
   mistake, hon being put for hou or for hon. Then the meaning would be
   evident; and the two parts would correspond the one with the other: 5.
   "For of this they are wilfully ignorant, that the heavens existed of
   old and the earth (which subsisted from water and in water,) by
   6. the word of God; by which the world at that time, being over-
   7. flowed with water, was destroyed. But the present heavens and the
   earth are by His word reserved, being kept for fire to the day of
   judgment and of the perdition of ungodly men." By "word" here is meant
   command, or power, or the fiat by which the world was created; and by
   the same it was destroyed, and by the same it will be finally
   destroyed. Instead of auto "the same" Griesbach has introduced into his
   text autou, "His." -- Ed

   2 Peter 3:9-13

   9. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
   slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should
   perish, but that all should come to repentance.

   9. Non tardat Dominus in promissione, sicuti quidam tarditatem
   slackness; existimant; sed tolerantem se praebet erga nos, nolens ullos
   perire, sed omnes ad poenitentiam recipere (aut, colligi, vel,
   aggregari.)

   10. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
   which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
   shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are
   therein shall be burnt up.

   10. Veniet autem dies Domini tanquam fur in nocte, in qua coeli in
   modum procellae transibunt, elementa autem ardore solventur; et terra,
   quaeque in ea sunt opera ardebunt.

   11. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner
   of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,

   11. Quum Haec igitur omnia solvantur, quales oportet nos esse in
   sanctis conversationibus et pietatibus;

   12. Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein
   the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall
   melt with fervent heat?

   12. Expectantes properando adventum diei Dei, propter quem coeli
   solventur, et elementa ardore consumentur?

   13. Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and
   a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

   13. Novos autem coelos et terram novam juxta promissum ejus expectamus,
   ín quibus habitat justitia.


   9. But the Lord is not slack, or, delays not. He checks extreme and
   unreasonable haste by another reason, that is, that the Lord defers his
   coming that he might invite all mankind to repentance. For our minds
   are always prurient, and a doubt often creeps in, why he does not come
   sooner. But when we hear that the Lord, in delaying, shews a concern
   for our salvation, and that he defers the time because he has a care
   for us, there is no reason why we should any longer complain of
   tardiness. He is tardy who allows an occasion to pass by through
   slothfulness: there is nothing like this in God, who in the best manner
   regulates time to promote our salvation. And as to the duration of the
   whole world, we must think exactly the same as of the life of every
   individual; for God by prolonging time to each, sustains him that he
   may repent. In the like manner he does not hasten the end of the world,
   in order to give to all time to repent.

   This is a very necessary admonition, so that we may learn to employ
   time aright, as we shall otherwise suffer a just punishment for our
   idleness.

   Not willing that any should perish. So wonderful is his love towards
   mankind, that he would have them all to be saved, and is of his own
   self prepared to bestow salvation on the lost. But the order is to be
   noticed, that God is ready to receive all to repentance, so that none
   may perish; for in these words the way and manner of obtaining
   salvation is pointed out. Every one of us, therefore, who is desirous
   of salvation, must learn to enter in by this way.

   But it may be asked, If God wishes none to perish, why is it that so
   many do perish? To this my answer is, that no mention is here made of
   the hidden purpose of God, according to which the reprobate are doomed
   to their own ruin, but only of his will as made known to us in the
   gospel. For God there stretches forth his hand without a difference to
   all, but lays hold only of those, to lead them to himself, whom he has
   chosen before the foundation of the world. [179]

   But as the verb chorosai is often taken passively by the Greeks, no
   less suitable to this passage is the verb which I have put in the
   margin, that God would have all, who had been before wandering and
   scattered, to be gathered or come together to repentance.

   10. But the day of the Lord will come. This has been added, that the
   faithful might be always watching, and not promise to-morrow to
   themselves. For we all labor under two very different evils -- too much
   haste, and slothfulness. We are seized with impatience for the day of
   Christ already expected; at the same time we securely regard it as afar
   off. As, then, the Apostle has before reproved an unreasonable ardor,
   so he now shakes off our sleepiness, so that we may attentively expect
   Christ at all times, lest we should become idle and negligent, as it is
   usually the case. For whence is it that flesh indulges itself except
   that there is no thought of the near coming of Christ?

   What afterwards follows, respecting the burning of heaven and earth,
   requires no long explanation, if indeed we duly consider what is
   intended. For it was not his purpose to speak refinedly of fire and
   storm, and other things, but only that he might introduce an
   exhortation, which he immediately adds, even that we ought to strive
   after newness of life. For he thus reasons, that as heaven and earth
   are to be purged by fire, that they may correspond with the kingdom of
   Christ, hence the renovation of men is much more necessary.
   Mischievous, then, are those interpreters who consume much labor on
   refined speculations, since the Apostle applies his doctrine to godly
   exhortations.

   Heaven and earth, he says, shall pass away for our sakes; is it meet,
   then, for us to be engrossed with the things of earth, and not, on the
   contrary, to attend to a holy and godly life? The corruptions of heaven
   and earth will be purged by fire, while yet as the creatures of God
   they are pure; what then ought to be done by us who are full of so many
   pollutions? As to the word godlinesses (pietatibus,) the plural number
   is used for the singular, except you take it as meaning the duties of
   godliness. [180] Of the elements of the world I shall only say this one
   thing, that they are to be consumed, only that they may be renovated,
   their substance still remaining the same, as it may be easily gathered
   from Romans 8:21, and from other passages. [181]

   12 Looking for and hasting unto, or, waiting for by hastening; so I
   render the words, though they are two participles; for what we had
   before separately he gathers now into one sentence, that is, that we
   ought hastily to wait. Now this contrarious hope possesses no small
   elegance, like the proverb, "Hasten slowly," (festina lente.) When he
   says, "Waiting for," he refers to the endurance of hope; and he sets
   hastening in opposition to topor; and both are very apposite. For as
   quietness and waiting are the peculiarities of hope, so we must always
   take heed lest the security of the flesh should creep in; we ought,
   therefore, strenuously to labor in good works, and run quickly in the
   race of our calling. [182] What he before called the day of Christ (as
   it is everywhere called in Scripture) he now calls the day of God, and
   that rightly, for Christ will then restore the kingdom to the Father,
   that God may be all in all.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [179] A similar view was taken by Estius, Piscator, and Beza. -- Ed.

   [180] The previous word is also in the plural number, "in holy
   conversations." What seems to be meant is, that every part of the
   conduct should be holy, and that every part of godliness should be
   attended to: "In every part of a holy life, and every act of
   godliness;" that is, we are not to be holy in part or pious in part,
   but attend to every branch of duty towards man, and every branch of
   duty towards God. -- Ed.

   [181] All that is said here is, that there will be new heavens and a
   new earth, and not that the present heavens and the present earth will
   be renovated. See Revelation 20:11; 21:1. -- Ed.

   [182] The first meaning of speudo is to hasten, and it is often used,
   when connected with another verb, adverbially as proposed by Calvin;
   but when followed as here by an accusative case, it has often the
   secondary meaning of earnestly desiring a thing. It is so taken here by
   Schleusner, Parkhurst, and Macknight; "Expecting and earnestly desiring
   the coming of the day of God." -- Ed

   2 Peter 3:14-18

   14. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
   diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and
   blameless.

   14. Quare, dilecti, quum Haec expectetis, studete incontaminati et
   irreprehensibiles ab eo inyeniri in pace:

   15. And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even
   as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him
   hath written unto you;

   15. Et Domini nostri tolerantiam salutem existimate, quemadmodum et
   dilectus frater noster Paulus, secundum datam sibi sapientiam scripsit
   vobis;

   16. As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in
   which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are
   unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures,
   unto their own destruction.

   16. Sicuti in omnibus Epistolis, loquens de iis in quibus sunt quaedam
   difficilia intellectu, quae indocti et instabiles invertunt (ut et
   caeteras Scripturas) ad suam perniciem.

   17. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware
   lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from
   your own stedfastness.

   17. Vos igitur, dilecti, praemoniti cavete, ut ne simul nefariorum
   errore abacti, excidatis à vestra firmitate.

   18. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
   Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

   18. Crescite autem in gratia et notitia Domini nostri et Servatoris
   Jesu Christi; ipsi gloria et nunc et in diem seternitatis


   14. Wherefore. He justly reasons from hope to its effect, or the
   practice of a godly life; for hope is living and efficacious; therefore
   it cannot be but that it will attract us to itself. He, then, who waits
   for new heavens, must begin with renewal as to himself, and diligently
   aspire after it; but they who cleave to their own filth, think nothing,
   it is certain, of God's kingdom, and have no taste for anything but for
   this corrupt world.

   But we must notice that he says, that we ought to be found blameless by
   Christ; for by these words he intimates, that while the world engages
   and engrosses the minds of others, we must cast our eyes on the Lord,
   and he shews at the same time what is real integrity, even that which
   is approved by his judgment, and not that which gains the Praise of
   men. [183]

   The word peace seems to be taken for a quiet state of conscience,
   founded on hope and patient waiting. [184] For as so few turn their
   attention to the judgment of Christ, hence it is, that while they are
   carried headlong by their importunate lusts, they are at the same time
   in a state of disquietude. This peace, then, is the quietness of a
   peaceable soul, which acquiesces in the word of God.

   It may be asked, how any one can be found blameless by Christ, when we
   all labor under so many deficiencies. But Peter here only points out
   the mark at which the faithful ought all to aim, though they cannot
   reach it, until having put off their flesh they become wholly united to
   Christ.

   15. The long-suffering of our Lord. He takes it as granted that Christ
   defers the day of his coming, because he has a regard for our
   salvation. He hence animates the faithful, because in a longer delay
   they have an evidence as to their own salvation. Thus, what usually
   disheartens others through weariness, he wisely turns to a contrary
   purpose.

   Even as our beloved brother Paul. We may easily gather from the Epistle
   to the Galatians, as well as from other places, that unprincipled men,
   who went about everywhere to disturb the churches, in order to
   discredit Paul, made use of this pretense, that he did not well agree
   with the other Apostles. It is then probable that Peter referred to
   Paul in order to shew their consent; for it was very necessary to take
   away the occasion for such a calumny. And yet, when I examine all
   things more narrowly, it seems to me more probable that this Epistle
   was composed by another according to what Peter communicated, than that
   it was written by himself, for Peter himself would have never spoken
   thus. But it is enough for me that we have a witness of his doctrine
   and of his goodwill, who brought forward nothing contrary to what he
   would have himself said.

   16. In which are some things. The relative which does not refer to
   epistles, for it is in the neuter gender. [185] The meaning is, that in
   the things which he wrote there was sometimes an obscurity, which gave
   occasion to the unlearned to go astray to their own ruin. We are
   reminded by these words, to reason soberly on things so high and
   obscure; and further, we are here strengthened against this kind of
   offense, lest the foolish or absurd speculations of men should disturb
   us, by which they entangle and distort simple truth, which ought to
   serve for edification.

   But we must observe, that we are not forbidden to read Paul's Epistles,
   because they contain some things hard and difficult to be understood,
   but that, on the contrary, they are commended to us, provided we bring
   a calm and teachable mind. For Peter condemns men who are trifling and
   volatile, who strangely turn to their own ruin what is useful to all.
   Nay, he says that this is commonly done as to all the Scripture: and
   yet he does not hence conclude, that we are not to read it, but only
   shews, that those vices ought to be corrected which prevent
   improvement, and not only so, but render deadly to us what God has
   appointed for our salvation.

   It may, however, be asked, Whence is this obscurity, for the Scripture
   shines to us like a lamp, and guides our steps? To this I reply, that
   it is nothing to be wondered at, if Peter ascribed obscurity to the
   mysteries of Christ's kingdom, and especially if we consider how hidden
   they are to the perception of the flesh. However the mode of teaching
   which God has adopted, has been so regulated, that all who refuse not
   to follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear
   light. At the same time, many are blind who stumble at mid-day; others
   are proud, who, wandering through devious paths, and flying over the
   roughest places, rush headlong into ruin.

   17. Ye, therefore, beloved. After having shewn to the faithful the
   dangers of which they were to beware, he now concludes by admonishing
   them to be wise. But he shews that there was need of being watchful,
   lest they should be overwhelmed. And, doubtless, the craft of our
   enemy, the many and various treacheries which he employs against us,
   the cavils of ungodly men, leave no place for security. Hence,
   vigilance must be exercised, lest the devices of Satan and of the
   wicked should succeed in circumventing us. It, however seems that we
   stand on slippery ground, and the certainty of our salvation is
   suspended, as it were, on a thread, since he declares to the faithful,
   that they ought to take heed lest they should fall from their own
   steadfastness.

   What, then, will become of us, if we are exposed to the danger of
   falling? To this I answer, that this exhortation, and those like it,
   are by no means intended to shake the firmness of that faith which
   recumbs on God, but to correct the sloth of our flesh. If any one
   wishes to see more on this subject, let him read what has been said on
   the tenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians.

   The meaning is this, that as long as we are in the flesh, our tardiness
   must be roused, and that this is fitly done by having our weakness, and
   the variety of dangers which surround us, placed before our eyes; but
   that the confidence which rests on God's promises ought not to be
   thereby shaken.

   18. But grow in grace. He also exhorts us to make progress; for it is
   the only way of persevering, to make continual advances, and not to
   stand still in the middle of our journey; as though he had said, that
   they only would be safe who labored to make progress daily.

   The word grace, I take in a general sense, as meaning those spiritual
   gifts we obtain through Christ. But as we become partakers of these
   blessings according to the measure of our faith, knowledge is added to
   grace; as though he had said, that as faith increases, so would follow
   the increase of grace. [186]

   To him be glory. This is a remarkable passage to prove the divinity of
   Christ; for what is said cannot belong to any but to God alone. The
   adverb of the present time, now, is designed for this end, that we may
   not rob Christ of his glory, during our warfare in the world. He then
   adds, for ever, that we may now form some idea of his eternal kingdom,
   which will make known to us his full and perfect glory.

   END OF THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER
     __________________________________________________________________

   [183] He says, "Expecting these things, be diligent," etc.; spoudasate,
   hasten, make speed, diligently strive, earnestly labor, carefully
   endeavor: "Therefore, beloved, since ye expect these things, diligently
   strive to be found by him in peace, unspotted and unblamable;" that is,
   having no stain, and not chargeable with crime. -- Ed

   [184] Some say, "peace" with God; but the view of Calvin is more
   suitable here. -- Ed.

   [185] It is in the feminine gender in some MSS. The authority as to the
   copies and versions is nearly equal. The difference is not much as to
   the sense, only "in which epistles," reads better. So thought Beza,
   Mill, and others. It has been a question as to the particular epistle
   referred to by Peter; for that he alludes to some particular epistle is
   evident from the manner in which he writes. The difficulty has arisen
   from connecting the reference made to Paul, only with the former part
   of the 15th verse, while that part ought to be viewed only as an
   addition to the former verse; and the former verse stands connected
   with the new heavens and the new earth. So that the subjects in hand
   are the day of judgment, the future state, and the necessity of being
   prepared for it; and that these are the things referred to is evident
   from this, that he says, that Paul speaks of them in all his epistles,
   which is not true, as to what is said at the beginning of the 15th
   verse. The passage then ought to be thus rendered: -- 14. Therefore,
   beloved, since ye expect these things,
   diligently strive to be found by him in peace,
   unspotted and unblamable;
   15. and deem the long-suffering of our Lord to be for salvation:
   even as Paul, our beloved brother, has, according to the wisdom given
   16. to him, written to you; as also in all his epistles,
   when speaking in them of these things;
   in which (epistles) there are some things difficult to be understood,"
   etc. Now the special epistle referred to was most probably the epistle
   to the Hebrews, one particular design of which was to direct the
   attention of the Jews to the country promised to their fathers. Some,
   indeed, hold that that epistle was written to the Jews in Judea; but
   others maintain that it was written to converted Hebrews generally,
   whether in Judea or elsewhere; and this passage seems to favor the
   latter opinion. If the view given here is right, that is, that the
   subjects on which reference is made to Paul, are those mentioned in the
   12^th, the 13^th, and 14^th verses, then there is no epistle of Paul
   which could be more appropriately referred to than that to the Hebrews,
   as the new heavens and the new earth answer exactly to "the better and
   heavenly country," mentioned in the Epistle to the Hebrews. See Hebrews
   11:16. Besides, the exhortations and warnings of that epistle wholly
   coincide with the exhortation given here by Peter. -- Ed.

   [186] "Grace" is the attainment, and "the knowledge" of Christ is the
   way and means. The chief thing is often mentioned first in Scripture,
   then that which leads to it: or the cause of it. -- Ed.

   THE ARGUMENT

   Though there was a dispute among the ancients respecting this Epistle,
   yet as the reading of it is useful, and as it contains nothing
   inconsistent with the purity of apostolic doctrine, and was received as
   authentic formerly, by some of the best, I willingly add it to the
   others. Its brevity, moreover, does not require a long statement of its
   contents; and almost the whole of it is nearly the same with the second
   chapter of the last Epistle.

   As unprincipled men, under the name of Christians, had crept in, whose
   chief object was to lead the unstable and weak to a profane contempt of
   God, Jude first shews, that the faithful ought not to have been moved
   by agents of this kind, by which the Church has always been assailed;
   and yet he exhorts them carefully to beware of such pests. And to
   render them more hateful and detestable, he denounces on them the
   approaching vengeance of God, such as their impiety deserved. Now, if
   we consider what Satan has attempted in our age, from the commencement
   of the revived gospel, and what arts he still busily employs to subvert
   the faith, and the fear of God, what was a useful warning in the time
   of Jude, is more than necessary in our age. But this will appear more
   fully as we proceed in reading the Epistle.

   The Epistle of jude
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jude 1-2

   1. Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them
   that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ,
   and called:

   1. Judas Jesu Christi servus, frater autem Jacobi,, vocatis qui in Deo
   Patre sanctificati sunt, et in Jesu Christo custoditi,

   2. Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.

   2. Misericordia vobis et pax et dilectio augeatur.


   1 Jude the servant of Jesus Christ. He calls himself the servant of
   Christ, not as the name applies to all the godly, but with respect to
   his apostleship; for they were deemed peculiarly the servants of
   Christ, who had some public office committed to them. And we know why
   the apostles were wont to give themselves this honorable name.
   Whosoever is not called, arrogates to himself presumptuously the right
   and authority of teaching. Then their calling was an evidence to the
   apostles, that they did not thrust themselves into their office through
   their own will. It was not, however, of itself sufficient to be
   appointed to their office, except they faithfully discharged it. And,
   no doubt, he who declares himself to be the servant of God, includes
   both these things, that is, that God is the bestower of the office
   which he exercises, and that he faithfully performs what has been
   committed to him. Many act falsely, and falsely boast to be what they
   are very far from being: we ought always to examine whether the reality
   corresponds with the profession.

   And brother of James. He mentions a name more celebrated than his own,
   and more known to the churches. For though faithfulness of doctrine and
   authority do not depend on the names of mortal men, yet it is a
   confirmation to the faith, when the integrity of the man who undertakes
   the office of a teacher is made certain to us. Besides, the authority
   of James is not here brought forward as that of a private individual,
   but because he was counted by all the Church as one of the chief
   apostles of Christ. He was the son of Alpheus, as I have said
   elsewhere. Nay, this very passage is a sufficient proof to me against
   Eusebius and others, who say, that he was a disciple, named Oblias,
   [James,] mentioned by Luke, in Acts 15:13; Acts 21:18, who was more
   eminent than the apostles in the Church. [187] But there is no doubt
   but that Jude mentions here his own brother, because he was eminent
   among the apostles. It is, then, probable, that he was the person to
   whom the chief honor was conceded by the rest, according to what Luke
   relates.

   To them that are sanctified by God the Father, or, to the called who
   are sanctified, etc. [188] By this expression, "the called," he denotes
   all the faithful, because the Lord has separated them for himself. But
   as calling is nothing else but the effect of eternal election, it is
   sometimes taken for it. In this place it makes but little difference in
   which way you take it; for he, no doubt, commends the grace of God, by
   which he has been pleased to choose them as his peculiar treasure. And
   he intimates that men do not anticipate God, and that they never come
   to him until he draws them.

   Of the same he says that they were sanctified in God the Father, which
   may be rendered, "by God the Father." I have, however, retained the
   very form of the expression, that readers may exercise their own
   judgment. For it may be, that this is the sense, -- that being profane
   in themselves, they had their holiness in God. But the way in which God
   sanctifies is, by regenerating us by his Spirit.

   Another reading, which the Vulgate has followed, is somewhat harsh, "To
   the beloved (egapemenois) in God the Father." I therefore regard it as
   corrupt; and it is, indeed, found but in a few copies.

   He further adds, that they were preserved in Jesus Christ. For we
   should be always in danger of death through Satan, and he might take us
   at any moment as an easy prey, were we not safe under the protection of
   Christ, whom the Father has given to be our guardian, so that none of
   those whom he has received under his care and shelter should perish.

   Jude then mentions here a threefold blessing, or favor of God, with
   regard to all the godly, -- that he has made them by his calling
   partakers of the gospel; that he has regenerated them, by his Spirit,
   unto newness of life; and that he has preserved them by the hand of
   Christ, so that they might not fall away from salvation.

   2. Mercy to you. Mercy means nearly the same as grace in the
   salutations of Paul. Were any one to wish for a refined distinction, it
   may be said that grace is properly the effect of mercy; for there is no
   other reason why God has embraced us in love, but that he pitied our
   miseries. Love may be understood as that of God towards men, as well as
   that of men towards one another. [189] If it be referred to God, the
   meaning is, that it might increase towards them, and that the assurance
   of divine love might be daily more confirmed in their hearts. The other
   meaning is, however, not unsuitable, that God would kindle and confirm
   in them mutual love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [187] Some have held, that James, mentioned in the forecited places in
   Acts, was not James the apostle, but another James, a disciple, and one
   of the seventy, who was also called Oblias: but this is not correct. --
   Ed.

   [188] So Beza renders the words, "To the called, sanctified by God the
   Father, and preserved by Jesus Christ:" that is, to the effectually
   called, (as the word commonly means,) set apart and separated by God
   from the ungodly world, and kept by Christ, having been committed to
   his care and protection. -- Ed.

   [189] As mercy is that of God, so it is more consistent to consider
   "peace" and "love'' to be those of God: "may the mercy" of God, "and
   the peace" of God, "and the love" of God, "be increased (or multiplied)
   to you" -- Ed.

   Jude 3-4

   3. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
   salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you,
   that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered
   unto the saints.

   3. Dilecti, quum omne studium adhiberem ad scribendum vobis de communi
   salute, necesse habui scribere vobis ad vos hortandos ut certando
   adjuvetis eam, quae semel tradita est sanctis, fidem.

   4. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old
   ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our
   God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   4. Subingressi enim sunt quidam homines, olim praescripti judicium,
   impii, Dei nostri gratiam transferentes in lasciviam, et Deum, qui
   solus est Herus, et Dominum Jesum Christum negantes.


   3. When I gave diligence. I have rendered the words spouden poioumenos,
   "Applying care:" literally they are, "Making diligence." But many
   interpreters explain the sentence in this sense, that a strong desire
   constrained Jude to write, as we usually say of those under the
   influence of some strong feeling, that they cannot govern or restrain
   themselves. Then, according to these expounders, Jude was under a sort
   of necessity, because a desire to write suffered him not to rest. But I
   rather think that the two clauses are separate, that though he was
   inclined and solicitous to write, yet a necessity compelled him. He
   then intimates, that he was indeed glad and anxious to write to them,
   but yet necessity urged him to do so, even because they were assailed
   (according to what follows) by the ungodly, and stood in need of being
   prepared to fight with them. [190]

   Then, in the first place, Jude testifies that he felt so much concern
   for their salvation, that he wished himself, and was indeed anxious to
   write to them; and, secondly, in order to rouse their attention, he
   says that the state of things required him to do so. For necessity adds
   strong stimulants. Had they not been forewarned how necessary his
   exhortation was, they might have been slothful and negligent; but when
   he makes this preface, that he wrote on account of the necessity of
   their case, it was the same as though he had blown a trumpet to awake
   them from their torpor.

   Of the common salvation. Some copies add "your," but without reason, as
   I think; for he makes salvation common to them and to himself. And it
   adds not a little weight to the doctrine that is announced, when any
   one speaks according to his own feelings and experience; for vain is
   what we say, if we speak of salvation to others, when we ourselves have
   no real knowledge of it. Then, Jude professed himself to be (so to
   speak) an experimental teacher, when he associated himself with the
   godly in the participation of the same salvation.

   And exhort you. Literally, "exhorting you;" but as he points out the
   end of his counsel, the sentence ought to be thus expressed. What I
   have rendered, "to help the faith by contending," means the same as to
   strive in retaining the faith, and courageously to sustain the contrary
   assaults of Satan. [191] For he reminds them that in order to persevere
   in the faith, various contests must be encountered and continual
   warfare maintained. He says that faith had been once delivered, that
   they might know that they had obtained it for this end, that they might
   never fail or fall away.

   4. For there are certain men crept in unawares. Though Satan is ever an
   enemy to the godly, and never ceases to harass them, yet Jude reminds
   those to whom he was writing of the state of things at that time. Satan
   now, he says, attacks and harasses you in a peculiar manner; it is
   therefore necessary to take up arms to resist him. We hence learn that
   a good and faithful pastor ought wisely to consider what the present
   state of the Church requires, so as to accommodate his doctrine to its
   wants.

   The word pareisedusan, which he uses, denotes an indirect and stealthy
   insinuation, by which the ministers of Satan deceive the unwary; for
   Satan sows his tares in the night, and while husbandmen are asleep, in
   order that he may corrupt the seed of God. And at the same time he
   teaches us that it is an intestine evil; for Satan in this respect also
   is crafty, as he raises up those who are of the flock to do mischief,
   in order that they may more easily creep in.

   Before of old ordained. He calls that judgment, or condemnation, or a
   reprobate mind, by which they were led astray to pervert the doctrine
   of godliness; for no one can do such a thing except to his own ruin.
   But the metaphor is taken from this circumstance, because the eternal
   counsel of God, by which the faithful are ordained unto salvation, is
   called a book: and when the faithful heard that these were given up to
   eternal death, it behooved them to take heed lest they should involve
   themselves in the same destruction. It was at the same time the object
   of Jude to obviate danger, lest the novelty of the thing should disturb
   and distress any of them; for if these were already long ago ordained,
   it follows that the Church is not tried or exercised but according to
   the infallible counsel of God. [192]

   The grace of our God. He now expresses more clearly what the evil was;
   for he says that they abused the grace of God, so as to lead themselves
   and others to take an impure and profane liberty in sinning. But the
   grace of God has appeared for a far different purpose, even that,
   denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may live soberly,
   righteously, and godly in this world. Let us, then, know that nothing
   is more pestilential than men of this kind, who from the grace of
   Christ take a cloak to indulge in lasciviousness. [193]

   Because we teach that salvation is obtained through God's mercy alone,
   the Papists accuse us of this crime. But why should we use words to
   refute their effrontery, since we everywhere urge repentance, the fear
   of God, and newness of life, and since they themselves not only corrupt
   the whole world with the worst examples, but also by their ungodly
   teaching take away from the world true holiness and the pure worship of
   God? Though I rather think, that those of whom Jude speaks, were like
   the libertines of our time, as it will be more evident from what
   follows.

   The only Lord God, or, God who alone is Lord. Some old copies have,
   "Christ, who alone is God and Lord." And, indeed, in the Second Epistle
   of Peter, Christ alone is mentioned, and there he is called Lord. [194]
   But He means that Christ is denied, when they who had been redeemed by
   his blood, become again the vassals of the Devil, and thus render void
   as far as they can that incomparable price. That Christ, then, may
   retain us as his peculiar treasure, we must remember that he died and
   rose again for us, that he might have dominion over our life and death.

   [190] Then the rendering would be, "Beloved, when I was applying all
   care to write to you of the common salvation, I deemed (or found) it
   necessary to write to you, in order to exhort you to contend for the
   faith once delivered to the saints." Macknight and some others give
   another meaning to the first clause, and one more literal: "Beloved,
   making all haste to write to you, concerning the common salvation, I
   have thought it necessary," etc. For this haste the Apostle gives a
   reason in the following verse, "For some men have stealthily crept in,"
   etc. This is the most obvious meaning of the passage. -- Ed.

   [191] The meaning of the verb is, to combat for, to strive, fight or
   contend for. It is a word derived from the games, and expresses a
   strenuous effort. Our version conveys well its meaning, "earnestly
   contend for the faith;" or, the words may be rendered, "strenuously
   combat for the faith;" not with the sword, says Beza, but with sound
   doctrine and the example of a holy life. -- Ed

   [192] The words literally are, "Who have been long ago (or, some time
   past) forewritten of for (or, as to) this judgment." The reference is
   to prophecy; such creepers in for the purpose of corrupting the truth
   had been foretold; and this creeping in for such a purpose was a
   judgment for yielding up themselves to the delusions of Satan. The word
   palai refers indefinitely to what is past, either long ago, or some
   time past. See Matthew 11:21, and Mark 15:44. The reference may be to
   ancient prophecies, or to those of our Savior and his Apostles. -- Ed

   [193] "The grace of God" here is evidently the gospel. They
   transformed, says Grotius, the gospel to a libidinous doctrine. -- Ed.

   [194] Griesbach excludes Theon, "God," from the text: then the passage
   would correspond in sense, with 2 Peter 2:1; literally, "denying the
   only sovereign and Lord of us, Jesus Christ." The word despoten,
   sovereign, or master, is used by Jude as well as by Peter. It was not
   the grace, but the ruling power of Christ that was denied; they boasted
   of his grace, but did not submit to him as a king. Hence the word
   despotes is used -- one exercising absolute power. We may render the
   words, "denying our only sovereign and Lord, Jesus Christ." -- Ed

   Jude 5-7

   5. I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this,
   how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt,
   afterward destroyed them that believed not.

   5. Commonefacere autem vos volo, quum istud semel noveritis, quod
   Dominus postquam ex terra Egypti populum servaverat, postea non
   credentes perdidit.

   6. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
   habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto
   the judgment of the great day.

   6. Angelos vero qui principatum (vel, initium) suum non servaverant,
   sed reliquerant suum domicilium, judicium magnae diei vinculis aeternis
   sub caligine servavit.

   7. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
   manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange
   flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal
   fire.

   7. Quemadmodum Sodoma et Gomorrha, et qae circum erant urbes, quum
   simili modo scortatae essent, et abiissent post carnem alienam,
   propositae sunt ignis aeterni judicium sustinentes.


   5. I will therefore put you in remembrance, or, remind you. He either
   modestly excuses himself, lest he should seem to teach as it were the
   ignorant things unknown to them; or, indeed, he openly declares in an
   emphatical manner, (which I approve more of,) that he adduced nothing
   new or unheard of before, in order that what he was going to say might
   gain more credit and authority. I only recall, he says, to your mind
   what you have already learnt. As he ascribes knowledge to them, so he
   says that they stood in need of warnings, lest they should think that
   the labor he undertook towards them was superfluous; for the use of
   God's word is not only to teach what we could not have otherwise known,
   but also to rouse us to a serious meditation of those things which we
   already understand, and not to suffer us to grow torpid in a cold
   knowledge.

   Now, the meaning is, that after having been called by God, we ought not
   to glory carelessly in his grace, but on the contrary, to walk
   watchfully in his fear; for if any trifles thus with God, the contempt
   of his grace will not be unpunished. And this he proves by three
   examples. He first refers to the vengeance which God executed on those
   unbelievers, whom he had chosen as his people, and delivered by his
   power. Nearly the same reference is made by Paul in the tenth chapter
   of the First Epistle to the Corinthians. The import of what he says is,
   that those whom God had honored with the greatest blessings, whom he
   had extolled to the same degree of honor as we enjoy at this day, he
   afterwards severely punished. Then in vain were all they proud of God's
   grace, who did not live in a manner suitable to their calling.

   The word people is by way of honor taken for the holy and chosen
   nation, as though he had said that it availed them nothing, that they
   by a singular favor had been taken into covenant. By calling them
   unbelieving, he denotes the fountain of all evils; for all their sins,
   mentioned by Moses, were owing to this, because they refused to be
   ruled by God's word. For where there is the subjection of faith, there
   obedience towards God necessarily appears in all the duties of life.

   6. And the angels. This is an argument from the greater to the less;
   for the state of angels is higher than ours; and yet God punished their
   defection in a dreadful manner. He will not then forgive our perfidy,
   if we depart from the grace unto which he has called us. This
   punishment, inflicted on the inhabitants of heaven, and on such
   superior ministers of God, ought surely to be constantly before our
   eyes, so that we may at no time be led to despise God's grace, and thus
   rush headlong into destruction.

   The word arche in this place, may be aptly taken for beginning as well
   as for principality or dominion. For Jude intimates that they suffered
   punishment, because they had despised the goodness of God and deserted
   their first vocation. And there follows immediately an explanation, for
   he says that they had left their own habitation; for, like military
   deserters, they left the station in which they had been placed.

   We must also notice the atrocity of the punishment which the Apostle
   mentions. They are not only free spirits but celestial powers; they are
   now held bound by perpetual chains. They not only enjoyed the glorious
   light of God, but his brightness shone forth in them, so that from
   them, as by rays, it spread over all parts of the universe; now they
   are sunk in darkness. But we are not to imagine a certain place in
   which the devils are shut up, for the Apostle simply intended to teach
   us how miserable their condition is, since the time they apostatized
   and lost their dignity. For wherever they go, they drag with them their
   own chains, and remain involved in darkness. Their extreme punishment
   is in the meantime, deferred until the great day comes.

   7. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha. This example is more general, for he
   testifies that God, excepting none of mankind, punishes without any
   difference all the ungodly. And Jude also mentions in what follows,
   that the fire through which the five cities perished was a type of the
   eternal fire. Then God at that time exhibited a remarkable example, in
   order to keep men in fear till the end of the world. Hence it is that
   it is so often mentioned in Scripture; nay, whenever the prophets
   wished to designate some memorable and dreadful judgment of God, they
   painted it under the figure of sulfurous fire, and alluded to the
   destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha. It is not, therefore, without reason
   that Jude strikes all ages with terror, by exhibiting the same view.

   When he says, the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves
   over to fornication, I do not apply these words to the Israelites and
   the angels, but to Sodom and Gomorrha. It is no objection that the
   pronoun toutois is masculine, for Jude refers to the inhabitants and
   not to the places. To go after strange flesh, is the same as to be
   given up to monstrous lusts; for we know that the Sodomites, not
   content with the common manner of committing fornication, polluted
   themselves in a way the most filthy and detestable. We ought to
   observe, that he devotes them to eternal fire; for we hence learn, that
   the dreadful spectacle which Moses describes, was only an image of a
   much heavier punishment.

   Jude 8-10

   8. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
   dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

   8. Similiter isti quoque somniis delusi, carnem quidem contaminant,
   dominationem vero, rejiciunt, et in glorias maledicta congerunt.

   9. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
   disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing
   accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

   9. Atqui Michael archangelus, quando judicio disceptans cum diabolo,
   disputabat de corpore Mosis, non ausus fuit judicium inferre
   contumeliae; sed dixit, Increpet te Dominus.

   10. But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what
   they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt
   themselves.

   10. Isti vero quae cumque non noverunt, convitiis incessunt; quaecunque
   vero naturaliter tanquam bruta animalia sciunt, in iis corrumpuntur.


   8. Likewise also these. This comparison is not to be pressed too
   strictly, as though he compared these whom he mentions in all things to
   be Sodomites, or to the fallen angels, or to the unbelieving people. He
   only shews that they were vessels of wrath appointed to destruction,
   and that they could not escape the hand of God, but that he would some
   time or another make them examples of his vengeance. For his design was
   to terrify the godly to whom he was writing, lest they should entangle
   themselves in their society.

   But he begins here more clearly to describe these impostors. And he
   says first, that they polluted their flesh as it were by dreaming, by
   which words he denotes their stupid effrontery, as though he had said
   that they abandoned themselves to all kinds of filth, which the most
   wicked abhor, except sleep took away shame and also consciousness. It
   is then a metaphorical mode of speaking, by which he intimates that
   they were so dull and stupid as to give up themselves without any shame
   to every kind of baseness. [195]

   There is a contrast to be noticed, when he says that they defiled or
   polluted the flesh, that is, that they degraded what was less
   excellent, and that yet they despised as disgraceful what is deemed
   especially excellent among mankind.

   It appears from the second clause that they were seditious men, who
   sought anarchy, that, being loosed from the fear of the laws, they
   might sin more freely. But these two things are nearly always
   connected, that they who abandon themselves to iniquity, do also wish
   to abolish all order. Though, indeed, their chief object is to be free
   from every yoke, it yet appears from the words of Jude that they were
   wont to speak insolently and reproachfully of magistrates, like the
   fanatics of the present day, who not only grumble because they are
   restrained by the authority of magistrates, but furiously declaim
   against all government, and say that the power of the sword is profane
   and opposed to godliness; in short, they superciliously reject from the
   Church of God all kings and all magistrates. Dignities or glories are
   orders or ranks eminent in power or honor.

   9. Yet Michael the archangel. Peter gives this argument shorter, and
   states generally, that angels, far more excellent than men, dare not
   bring forward a railing judgment. [2 Peter 2:11.]

   But as this history is thought to have been taken from an apocryphal
   book, it has hence happened that less weight has been attached to this
   Epistle. But since the Jews at that time had many things from the
   traditions of the fathers, I see nothing unreasonable in saying that
   Jude referred to what had already been handed down for many ages. I
   know indeed that many puerilities had obtained the name of tradition,
   as at this day the Papists relate as traditions many of the silly
   dotages of the monks; but this is no reason why they should not have
   had some historical facts not committed to writing.

   It is beyond controversy that Moses was buried by the Lord, that is,
   that his grave was concealed according to the known purpose of God. And
   the reason for concealing his grave is evident to all, that is, that
   the Jews might not bring forth his body to promote superstition. What
   wonder then is it, when the body of the prophet was hidden by God,
   Satan should attempt to make it known; and that angels, who are ever
   ready to serve God, should on the other hand resist him? And doubtless
   we see that Satan almost in all ages has been endeavoring to make the
   bodies of God's saints idols to foolish men. Therefore this Epistle
   ought not to be suspected on account of this testimony, though it is
   not found in Scripture.

   That Michael is introduced alone as disputing against Satan is not new.
   We know that myriads of angels are ever ready to render service to God;
   but he chooses this or that to do his business as he pleases. What Jude
   relates as having been said by Michael, is found also in the book of
   Zechariah,

   "Let God chide (or check) thee, Satan."
   (Zechariah 3:2.)

   And it is a comparison, as they say, between the greater and the less.
   Michael dared not to speak more severely against Satan (though a
   reprobate and condemned) than to deliver him to God to be restrained;
   but those men hesitated not to load with extreme reproaches the powers
   which God had adorned with peculiar honors.

   10. But these speak evil of those things which they know not. He means
   that they had no taste for anything but what was gross, and as it were
   beastly, and therefore did not perceive what was worthy of honor; and
   that yet they added audacity to madness, so that they feared not to
   condemn things above their comprehension; and that they also labored
   under another evil -- for when like beasts they were carried away to
   those things which gratified the senses of the body, they observed no
   moderation, but gorged themselves excessively like the swine which roll
   themselves in stinking mud. The adverb naturally is set in opposition
   to reason and judgment for the instinct of nature alone rules in brute
   animals; but reason ought to govern men and to bridle their appetites.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [195] The "dreaming" is connected with the three things which follow,
   defiling the flesh, despising government and slandering dignities.
   Hence the idea conveyed by our version, in which filthy is introduced,
   is by no means correct. Allusion seems to be made to the pretensions of
   false prophets in former times. See Jeremiah 23:25-27. The false
   prophets taught what they pretended to see in dreams, as dreams as well
   as visions were vouchsafed to true prophets. See Joel 2:28. It is not
   improbable that those referred to here pretended that they had received
   what they taught., by supernatural dreams; for how otherwise could they
   deceive others, especially respecting errors so gross and palpable as
   are here mentioned? The eighth verse is, as to its construction,
   connected with the seventh. The hos and the homoios are corresponding
   terms; "as Sodom and Gomorrha, etc., are set forth for an example, in
   like manner also these would be." This is the drift of the passage; --
   8. "In like manner, indeed, shall also these dreamers be that is,
   an example of divine vengeance,
   who defile the flesh, despise dominion, and revile dignities." Peter
   threatened them with "swift destruction," 2 Peter 2:1. There are here
   three things mentioned which apply to the three instances previously
   adduced: like the Sodomites they defiled the flesh; like the fallen
   angels they despised dominion; and like the Israelites in the
   wilderness, they reviled dignities; for it was especially by opposing
   the power given to Moses that the Israelites manifested their unbelief.
   -- Ed.

   Jude 11-13

   11. Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
   greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the
   gainsaying of Core.

   11. Vae illis, quoniam viam Cain ingressi sunt (Genesis 4:12;) et
   deceptione mercedis Balaam effusi sunt (Numbers 22:21;) et
   contradictione Core perierunt (Numbers 26:2.)

   12. These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with
   you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water,
   carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit,
   twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

   12. Hi sunt in fraternis vestris conviviis maculae, inter se (vel
   vobiscum) convivantes, secure pascentes seipsos; nubes aqua carentes,
   quae a ventis circum aguntur; arbores autummi emarcidae, et eradicata
   infrugiferae, bis emortuae, et eradicatae;

   13. Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering
   stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.

   13. Undae efferatae maris, despumantes sua ipserum dedecora; stelie
   erraticae, quibus caligo tenebrarum in aeternum servata est.


   11. Woe unto them. It is a wonder that he inveighs against them so
   severely, when he had just said that it was not permitted to an angel
   to bring a railing accusation against Satan. But it was not his purpose
   to lay down a general rule. He only shewed briefly, by the example of
   Michael, how intolerable was their madness when they insolently
   reproached what God honored. It was certainly lawful for Michael to
   fulminate against Satan his final curse; and we see how vehemently the
   prophets threatened the ungodly; but when Michael forbore extreme
   severity (otherwise lawful), what madness was it to observe no
   moderation towards those excelling in glory? But when he pronounced woe
   on them, he did not so much imprecate evil on them, but rather reminded
   them what sort of end awaited them; and he did so, lest they should
   carry others with them to perdition.

   He says that they were the imitators of Cain, who being ungrateful to
   God and perverting his worship through an ungodly and wicked heart,
   forfeited his birthright. He says that they were deceived like Balaam
   by a reward, because they adulterated the doctrine of true religion for
   the sake of filthy lucre. But the metaphor he uses, expresses something
   more; for he says that they overflowed, even because their excess was
   like overflowing water. He says in the third place, that they imitated
   the contradiction of Core, because they disturbed the order and
   quietness of the church.

   12. These are spots in your feasts of charity. They who read, "among
   your charities," do not, as I think, sufficiently explain the true
   meaning. For he calls those feasts charities, (agapais,) which the
   faithful had among themselves for the sake of testifying their
   brotherly unity. Such feasts, he says, were disgraced by impure men,
   who afterwards fed themselves to an excess; for in these there was the
   greatest frugality and moderation. It was then not right that these
   gorgers should be admitted, who afterwards indulged themselves to an
   excess elsewhere.

   Some copies have, "Feasting with you," which reading, if approved, has
   this meaning, that they were not only a disgrace, but that they were
   also troublesome and expensive, as they crammed themselves without
   fear, at the public expense of the church. Peter speaks somewhat
   different, [2 Peter 2:13,] who says that they took delight in errors,
   and feasted together with the faithful, as though he had said that they
   acted inconsiderately who cherished such noxious serpents, and that
   they were very foolish who encouraged their excessive luxury. And at
   this day I wish there were more judgment in some good men, who, by
   seeking to be extremely kind to wicked men, bring great damage to the
   whole church.

   Clouds they are without water. The two similitudes found in Peter are
   here given in one, but to the same purpose, for both condemn vain
   ostentation: these unprincipled men, though promising much, were yet
   barren within and empty, like clouds driven by stormy winds, which give
   hope of rain, but soon vanish into nothing. Peter adds the similitude
   of a dry and empty fountain; but Jude employs other metaphors for the
   same end, that they were trees fading, as the vigor of trees in autumn
   disappears. He then calls them trees unfruitful, rooted up, and twice
   dead; [196] as though he had said, that there was no sap within, though
   leaves might appear.

   13. Raging waves of the sea. Why this was added, we may learn more
   fully from the words of Peter: [2 Peter 2:17,18] it was to shew, that
   being inflated with pride, they breathed out, or rather cast out the
   scum of high-flown stuff of words in grandiloquent style. At the same
   time they brought forth nothing spiritual, their object being on the
   contrary to make men as stupid as brute animals. Such, as it has been
   before stated, are the fanatics of our day, who call themselves
   Libertines. You may justly say that they make only rumbling sounds;
   for, despising common language, they form for themselves an exotic
   idiom, I know not what. They seem at one time to carry their disciples
   above heaven, then they suddenly fall down to beastly errors, for they
   imagine a state of innocency in which there is no difference between
   baseness and honesty; they imagine a spiritual life, when fear is
   extinguished, and when every one heedlessly indulges himself; they
   imagine that we become gods, because God absorbs the spirits when they
   quit their bodies. With the more care and reverence ought the
   simplicity of Scripture to be studied, lest, by reasoning more
   refinedly than is right, we should not draw men to heaven, but on the
   contrary be involved in manifold labyrinths. He therefore calls them
   wandering stars, because they dazzled the eyes by a sort of evanescent
   light.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [196] "Twice dead" is deemed by some a proverbial expression to signify
   what is altogether dead; or, as by Macknight, it means that they were
   dead when professing Judaism, and dead after having made a profession
   of the gospel. -- Ed.

   Jude 14-16

   14. And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying,
   Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,

   14. Prius autem etiam de iis vaticinatus est septimus ab Adam Enoch,
   dicens, Ecce venit Dominus in sanctis millibus suis,

   15. To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly
   among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
   committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have
   spoken against him.

   15. Ut faciat judicium adversus omnes, et redarguat ex eis omnes impios
   de factis omnibus impietatis quae impie patrarunt deque omnibus duris
   quae loquuti sunt adversus Deum peccatores impii.

   16. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts;
   and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in
   admiration because of advantage.

   16. Hi sunt murmuratores, queruli, juxta concupiscentias suas
   ambulantes, et os illorum loquitur tumida, admirantes personas,
   utilitatis gratia.


   14. And Enoch also. I rather think that this prophecy was unwritten,
   than that it was taken from an apocryphal book; for it may have been
   delivered down by memory to posterity by the ancients. [197] Were any
   one to ask, that since similar sentences occur in many parts of
   Scripture, why did he not quote a testimony written by one of the
   prophets? the answer is obvious, that he wished to repeat from the
   oldest antiquity what the Spirit had pronounced respecting them: and
   this is what the words intimate; for he says expressly that he was the
   seventh from Adam, in order to commend the antiquity of the prophecy,
   because it existed in the world before the flood.

   But I have said that this prophecy was known to the Jews by being
   reported; but if any one thinks otherwise, I will not contend with him,
   nor, indeed, respecting the epistle itself, whether it be that of Jude
   or of some other. In things doubtful, I only follow what seems
   probable.

   Behold, the Lord cometh, or came. The past tense, after the manner of
   the prophets, is used for the future. He says, that the Lord would come
   with ten thousand of his saints; [198] and by saints he means the
   faithful as well as angels; for both will adorn the tribunal of Christ,
   when he shall descend to judge the world. He says, ten thousand, as
   Daniel also mentions myriads of angels, (Daniel 7:10;) in order that,
   the multitude of the ungodly may not, like a violent sea, overwhelm the
   children of God; but that they may think of this, that the Lord will
   sometime collect his own people, a part of whom are dwelling in heaven,
   unseen by us, and a part are hid under a great mass of chaff.

   But the vengeance suspended over the wicked ought to keep the elect in
   fear and watchfulness. He speaks of deeds and words, Because their
   corrupters did much evil, not only by their wicked life, but also by
   their impure and false speech. And their words were hard, on account of
   the refractory audacity, by which, being elated, they acted insolently.
   [199]

   16. These are murmurers. They who indulge their depraved lusts, are
   hard to please, and morose, so that they are never satisfied. Hence it
   is, that they always murmur and complain, however kindly good men may
   treat them. [200] He condemns their proud language, because they
   haughtily made a boast of themselves; but at the same time he shews
   that they were mean in their disposition, for they were servilely
   submissive for the sake of gain. And, commonly, this sort of
   inconsistency is seen in unprincipled men of this kind. When there is
   no one to check their insolence, or when there is nothing that stands
   in their way, their pride is intolerable, so that they imperiously
   arrogate everything to themselves; but they meanly flatter those whom
   they fear, and from whom they expect some advantage. He takes persons
   as signifying eternal greatness and power.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [197] This is the most common opinion. There is no evidence of such a
   book being known for some time after this epistle was written; and the
   book so called was probably a forgery, occasioned by this reference to
   Enoch's prophecy. See Macknight's Preface to this Epistle. Until of
   late, it was supposed to be lost; but in 1821, the late Archbishop
   Laurence, having found an Ethiopia version of it, published it with a
   translation. -- Ed.

   [198] Literally, "with his holy myriads." -- Ed

   [199] There seems to be a want of due order in the 15th verse; the
   execution of judgment is mentioned first, and then the conviction of
   the ungodly; but it is an order which exactly corresponds with
   numberless passages in Scripture: the final action first, and then that
   which lends to it. -- Ed.

   [200] We may render the words "Grumblers and fault-finders," that is,
   as the word means, with their own lot: they grumbled or murmured
   against others, and were discontented with their own condition; and yet
   walked in such a way (that is, in indulging their lusts,) as made their
   lot worse and occasioned still more grumbling. -- Ed.

   Jude 17-19

   17. But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the
   apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

   17. Vos autem dilecti, memores estis (vel, estote) verborum quae
   praedicta sunt ab apostolis Domini Christ: nostri Jesu nempe,

   18. How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time,
   who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

   18. Quod vobis dixerunt, ultimo tempore futuros (vel, venturos)
   derisores, qui secundum concupiscentias tias suarum impietatum
   ambularent.

   19. These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
   Spirit.

   19. Hi sunt qui seipsos segregant, animales, Spiritum non habentes.


   17. But, beloved. To a most ancient prophecy he now adds the
   admonitions of the apostles, the memory of whom was recent. As to the
   verb mnesthete, it makes no great difference, whether you read it as
   declarative or as an exhortation; for the meaning remains the same,
   that being fortified by the prediction he quotes, they ought to be
   terrified.

   By the last time he means that in which the renewed condition of the
   Church received a fixed form till the end of the world; and it began at
   the first coming of Christ.

   After the usual manner of Scripture, he calls them scoffers who, being
   inebriated with a profane and impious contempt of God, rush headlong
   into a brutal contempt of the Divine Being, so that no fear nor
   reverence keeps them any longer within the limits of duty: as no dread
   of a future judgment exists in their hearts, so no hope of eternal
   life. So at this day the world is full of Epicurean despisers of God,
   who having cast off every fear, madly scoff at the whole doctrine of
   true religion, regarding it as fabulous.

   19. These be they who separate themselves. Some Greek copies have the
   participle by itself, other copies add heautous, "themselves;" but the
   meaning is nearly the same. He means that they separated from the
   Church, because they would not bear the yoke of discipline, as they who
   indulge the flesh dislike spiritual life. [201] The word sensual, or
   animal, stands opposed to spiritual, or to the renovation of grace; and
   hence it means the vicious or corrupt, such as men are when not
   regenerated. For in that degenerated nature which we derive from Adam,
   there is nothing but what is gross and earthly; so that no part of us
   aspires to God, until we are renewed by his Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [201] This is the common interpretation, and yet it seems inconsistent
   with what is previously said of these men, that they crept in
   stealthily, and "feasted" with the members of the Church. The heautous,
   though retained by Griesbach, is excluded by Wetstein and others, being
   absent from most of the MSS. The verb apodiorizo, means to separate by
   a boundary two portions from one another, and hence metaphorically to
   separate or cause divisions: "These be they who cause divisions." They
   were doing the same thing as those mentioned by Paul in Romans 16:17.
   They were producing discords in the Church, and not separations from
   it; and by continuing in it, they became "spots and stains" to its
   members. -- Ed

   Jude 20-25

   20. But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,
   praying in the Holy Ghost,

   20. Vos autem dilecti, sanctissimæ vestræ fidei vosmet superstruentes,
   in Spiritu Sancti precantes,

   21. Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our
   Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

   21. Vosmet in charitate servate, expectantes misericordiam Domini
   nostri Jesu Christi in vitam eternam.

   22. And of some have compassion, making a difference.

   22. Et hos quidem miseramini, dijudicantes;

   23. And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating
   even the garment spotted by the flesh.

   23. Illos verò per timorem servate, ex incendio rapientes, odio
   prosquentes etiam maculatam a' carne tunicam.

   24. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present
   you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,

   24. Ei autem qui servare potest vos (vel, eos) à peccato immunes, et
   statuere in conspectu gloriae suae reprehensibiles cum exultatione,

   25. To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion
   and power, both now and ever. Amen.

   25. Soli sapienti Deo, Servatori nostro, gloria et magnificentia et
   perium et potestas, nunc, et in omnia secula. Amen.


   20. But ye, beloved. He shews the manner in which they could overcome
   all the devices of Satan, that is, by having love connected with faith,
   and by standing on their guard as it were in their watch-tower, until
   the coming of Christ. But as he uses often and thickly his metaphors,
   so he has here a way of speaking peculiar to himself, which must be
   briefly noticed.

   He bids them first to build themselves on faith; by which he means,
   that the foundation of faith ought to be retained, but that the first
   instruction is not sufficient, except they who have been already
   grounded on true faith, went on continually towards perfection. He
   calls their faith most holy, in order that they might wholly rely on
   it, and that, leaning on its firmness, they might never vacillate.

   But since the whole perfection of man consists in faith, it may seem
   strange that he bids them to build upon it another building, as though
   faith were only a commencement to man. This difficulty is removed by
   the Apostle in the words which follow, when he adds, that men build on
   faith when love is added; except, perhaps, some one may prefer to take
   this meaning, that men build on faith, as far as they make proficiency
   in it, and doubtless the daily progress of faith is such, that itself
   rises up as a building. [202] Thus the Apostle teaches us, that in
   order to increase in faith, we must be instant in prayer and maintain
   our calling by love.

   Praying in the Holy Ghost. The way of persevering is, when we are
   endued with the power of God. Hence whenever the question is respecting
   the constancy of faith, we must flee to prayer. And as we commonly pray
   in a formal manner, he adds, In the Spirit; as though he had said, that
   such is our sloth, and that such is the coldness of our flesh, that no
   one can pray aright except he be roused by the Spirit of God; and that
   we are also so inclined to diffidence and trembling, that no one dares
   to call God his Father, except through the teaching of the same Spirit;
   for from him is solicitude, from him is ardor and vehemence, from him
   is alacrity, from him is confidence in obtaining what we ask; in short,
   from him are those unutterable groanings mentioned by Paul (Romans
   8:26.) It is not, then, without reason that Jude teaches us, that no
   one can pray as he ought without having the Spirit as his guide.

   21. Keep yourselves in the love of God. He has made love as it were the
   guardian and the ruler of our life; not that he might set it in
   opposition to the grace of God, but that it is the right course of our
   calling, when we make progress in love. But as many things entice us to
   apostasy, so that it is difficult to keep us faithful to God to the
   end, he calls the attention of the faithful to the last day. For the
   hope of that alone ought to sustain us, so that we may at no time
   despond; otherwise we must necessarily fail every moment.

   But it ought to be noticed that he would not have us to hope for
   eternal life, except through the mercy of Christ: for he will in such a
   manner be our judge, as to have no other rule in judging us than that
   gratuitous benefit of redemption obtained by himself.

   22. And of some have compassion. He adds another exhortation, shewing
   how the faithful ought to act in reproving their brethren, in order to
   restore them to the Lord. He reminds them that such ought to be treated
   in different ways, every one according to his disposition: for to the
   meek and teachable we ought to use kindness; but others, who are hard
   and perverse, must be subdued by terror. [203] This is the difference
   which he mentions.

   The participle diakrinomenoi, I know not why this is rendered in a
   passive sense by Erasmus. It may, indeed, be rendered in either way,
   but its active meaning is more suitable to the context. The meaning
   then is, that if we wish to consult the well-being of such as go
   astray, we must consider the character and disposition of every one; so
   that they who are meek and tractable may in a kind manner be restored
   to the right way, as being objects of pity; but if any be perverse, he
   is to be corrected with more severity. And as asperity is almost
   hateful, he excuses it on the ground of necessity; for otherwise, they
   who do not willingly follow good counsels, cannot be saved.

   Moreover, he employs a striking metaphor. When there is a danger of
   fire, we hesitate not to snatch away violently whom we desire to save;
   for it would not be enough to beckon with the finger, or kindly to
   stretch forth the hand. So also the salvation of some ought to be cared
   for, because they will not come to God, except when rudely drawn. Very
   different is the old translation, which reading is however found in
   many of the Greek copies; the Vulgate is, "Rebuke the judged," (Arguite
   dijudicatos.) But the first meaning is more suitable, and is, I think,
   according to the old and genuine reading. The word to save, is
   transferred to men, not that they are the authors, but the ministers of
   salvation.

   23. Hating even the garment. This passage, which otherwise would appear
   obscure, will have no difficulty in it, when the metaphor is rightly
   explained. He would have the faithful not only to beware of contact
   with vices, but that no contagion might reach them, he reminds them
   that everything that borders on vices and is near to them ought to be
   avoided: as, when we speak of lasciviousness, we say that all
   excitements to lusts ought to be removed. The passage will also become
   clearer, when the whole sentence is filled up, that is, that we should
   hate not only the flesh, but also the garment, which, by a contact with
   it, is infected. The particle kai even serves to give greater emphasis.
   He, then, does not allow evil be cherished by indulgence, so that he
   bids all preparations and all accessories, as they say, to be cut off.

   24 Now unto him that is able to keep you. He closes the Epistle with
   praise to God; by which he shews that our exhortations and labors can
   do nothing except through the power of God accompanying them. [204]

   Some copies have "them" instead of "you." If we receive this reading,
   the sense will be, "It is, indeed, your duty to endeavor to save them;
   but it is God alone who can do this" However, the other reading is what
   I prefer; in which there is an allusion to the preceding verse; for
   after having exhorted the faithful to save what was perishing, that
   they might understand that all their efforts would be vain except God
   worked with them, he testifies that they could not be otherwise saved
   than through the power of God. In the latter clause there is indeed a
   different verb, phulaxai, which means to guard; so the allusion is to a
   remoter clause, when he said, Keep yourselves

   END OF THE EPISTLE OF JUDE
     __________________________________________________________________

   [202] It is better to take "faith" here metonymically for the word or
   doctrine of faith, the gospel; and the sense would be more evident,
   were we to render heautous, "one another," as it means in 1
   Thessalonians 5:13 20. "But ye, beloved, building one another on your
   most holy faith,
   (on the most holy doctrine which you believe,) praying by the
   21. Holy Spirit, keep one another in love to God,
   waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.
   And on some, indeed, have compassion, making a difference;
   but others save with fear," etc. The whole passage would read thus
   better, when their duty towards one another is specifically pointed
   out. -- Ed.

   [203] Though most agree that by "fear" here is meant terror, that is,
   that the persons referred to are to be terrified by the judgment which
   awaited them; yet what follows seems favorable to another view, that
   fear means the care and caution with which they were to be treated; for
   the act of saving them is compared to that of a man snatching anything
   from the fire, in doing which he must be careful lest he himself should
   be burnt; and then the other comparison, that of a man shunning an
   infected garment lest he should catch the contagion, favors the same
   view. Hence our version seems right -- "with fear." -- Ed.

   [204] The doxology is as follows, -- "To the only wise God (or, to the
   wise God alone) our Savior, be glory and greatness, might and dominion,
   both now and through all ages." "Dominion" (exousia) is the right to
   govern, imperial authority or power; "might" (kratos) is strength to
   effect his purpose, omnipotence; "greatness" (megalosune) comprises
   knowledge, wisdom, holiness, and everything that constitutes what is
   really great and magnificent; and (doxa) is the result of all these
   things which belong to God; all terminate in his glory. The ultimate
   issue is first mentioned, then the things which lead to it. It is by
   acknowledging his sovereign power, his capacity to exercise that power
   -- his omnipotence, and his greatness in everything that constitutes
   greatness, that we give him the glory, the honor, and the praise due to
   his name. -- Ed.

   A TRANSLATION OF

   CALVIN'S VERSION OF

   THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners who are
   scattered through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithyuia,

   2 Elected according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the
   sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and the sprinkling of the
   blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.

   3 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who,
   according to his great mercy hath begotten us again to a living hope,
   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

   4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, laid up
   in heaven for you;

   5 Who by the power of God are kept through faith unto salvation, which
   is ready to be revealed at the last time:

   6 On account of which ye exult, though now for a little while, if it be
   necessary, ye are made sorrowful through various temptations;

   7 That the probation of your faith, much more precious than gold which
   perisheth, though even it be proved by fire, may be found unto praise,
   and honour, and glory, when Jesus Christ shall be revealed:

   8 Whom, though ye have not seen, ye love; on whom believing, though ye
   see him not, ye exult with joy unspeakable and glorious;

   9 Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

   10 Of which, salvation the prophets inquired and searched, who
   prophesied of future grace to us;

   11 Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ who was
   in them did signify, previously testifying of the sufferings of Christ,
   and of the glories which were to follow:

   12 To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they
   ministered the things which have been now declared to you by those who
   have preached to you the gospel, through the Holy Spirit sent from
   heaven; into which things the angels desire to look.

   13 Therefore, girding up the loins of your mind, being sober, perfectly
   hope for the grace which is to be brought to you at the revelation of
   Jesus Christ;

   14 As obedient children, not conformed to former lusts which prevailed
   during your ignorance:

   15 But as he who has called you is holy, be ye also yourselves holy in
   your whole conduct;

   16 Because it is written, "Be ye holy, for I sin holy."

   17 And since ye call on the Father, who, without respect of persons,
   judgeth the work of every one, puss in fear the time of your

   18 Sojourning; knowing that not with corruptible things, silver or
   gold, you have been redeemed from your vain way of living, delivered
   down from the fathers;

   19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and
   undefiled:

   20 Who had been, indeed, foreordained before the world was founded, but
   has been manifested in the last times for you,

   21 Who through him believe in God, who has raised him from the dead,
   and has given him glory, that your faith and hope may be in God:

   22 Purifying your souls by obedience to the truth through the Spirit,
   with an unfeigned brotherly love, love ye one another from a pure heart
   fervently;

   23 Having been begotten again, not from a seed that is corruptible, but
   incorruptible, through the word of the living God, which abideth for
   ever.

   24 For all flesh is as grass, and all his glory as the flower of the
   grass: wither does the grass, and its flower fades;

   25 but the word of the Lord remains for ever: and this is the word
   which has been declared to you.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 Laying aside, therefore, all wickedness, and all guile, and
   dissimulations, and envyings, and all slanderings,

   2 As infants lately born, desire the milk that is rational and
   guileless, that by it ye may grow;

   3 If indeed ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious:

   4 To whom coming as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but
   chosen by God and precious,

   5 Ye also yourselves as living stones are built up a spiritual house, a
   holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God
   through Jesus Christ.

   6 Therefore also the Scripture contains this, "Behold, I lay in Sion a
   corner-stone, chosen, precious; and he who believeth in him shall not
   be ashamed."

   7 To you, then, who believe, he is precious; but to the unbelieving,
   the stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the
   corner;

   8 And a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to those who stumble
   at the word, being unbelieving; to which also they had been appointed.

   9 But ye are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
   peculiar people, that ye may declare the virtues of him who has called
   you out of darkness

   10 Into his marvelous light: who sometimes were not a people, but now
   are the people of God; who had not obtained mercy, but now have
   obtained mercy.

   11 Beloved, I exhort you as sojourners and strangers, to abstain from
   carnal desires, which war against the soul;

   12 Having your behavior good among the Gentiles, that whereas they
   speak against you as evil-doers, they may, considering your good works,
   glorify God in the day of visitation.

   13 Be then subject to every human ordinance for the Lord's sake;

   14 Whether to the king, as supreme; or to governors, as those who are
   sent by him, for the punishment indeed of evil-doers, but for the
   praise of those who do well:

   15 For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put a stop
   to the ignorance of foolish men;

   16 As free, and not having liberty as a cloak for wickedness, but as
   the servants of God.

   17 Honor all, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.

   18 The servants, let them be subject with all fear to their lords, not
   only to the good and humane, but also to the perverse.

   19 For this is acceptable, if for conscience towards God any one bears
   sorrows, suffering unjustly:

   20 For what sort of glory is it, if ye bear it when having done evil ye
   be buffeted? but if, having done well and suffering, ye bear it, this
   is acceptable with God.

   21 For to this end you have been called; because Christ also suffered
   for you, leaving you an example, that ye may follow his footsteps;

   22 Who did no sin, nor was guile found in his mouth; who, when reviled,
   reviled not again;

   23 When suffering, threatened not; but committed his cause to him who
   judgeth righteously;

   24 Who bare himself our sins in his own body on the tree, that we,
   being dead to sin, may live to righteousness; by whose bruise have ye
   been healed.

   25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but ye have been now turned to
   the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 3

   1 In like manner the wives, let them be subject to their own husbands,
   that even if any believe not the word, they may without the word be
   gained by the behavior of their wives,

   2 While observing your pure behavior and fear:

   3 Whose adorning, let it not be the outward, in the plaiting of the
   hair and the encircling of gold, or the putting on of cloaks;

   4 But the inner man of the heart, which is in the incorruption of a
   placid and quiet spirit, which before God is precious.

   5 For so formerly also holy women who hoped in God, adorned themselves,
   being subject to their own husbands;

   6 As Sara, who obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose daughters ye
   become, when ye do well, and are not terrified by any dread.

   7 Let husbands in like manner dwell with them according to knowledge,
   giving honor to the wife as the weaker vessel, and as joint-heirs of
   the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.

   8 Finally, be ye of one mind, compassionate, loving to the brethren,
   merciful, humble-minded;

   9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing, but on the
   contrary, bless ye, knowing that you have been called for this end,
   that ye may inherit a blessing.

   10 For let him who would love life and see good days, keep his tongue
   from evil and his lips from speaking guile; let him turn away from evil
   and do good;

   11 Let him seek peace and pursue it:

   12 Because the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his cars to
   their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against them who do evil.

   13 And who is he who can do you harm, if ye be followers of what is
   good?

   14 But if ye also suffer for righteousness, happy are ye; and the fear
   of them fear not, nor be troubled;

   15 But sanctify the Lord of hosts in your hearts, and be ready always
   for an answer to any one asking you a reason for the hope that is in
   you, with meekness and fear;

   16 Having a good conscience, that whereas they speak against you as
   evil-doers, they may be ashamed who slander your good behavior in
   Christ.

   17 For it is better to suffer, if so be the will of God, for doing good
   than for doing evil:

   18 Because Christ also once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust,
   that he might bring us to God, having indeed been put to death in the
   flesh, but brought to life by file Spirit:

   19 By whom having also gone, he preached to the spirits who were in
   prison,

   20 When there were formerly unbelievers, when once the patience of God
   waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was prepared; in which a few,
   that is, eight souls, were saved by water;

   21 Corresponding to which, baptism saves us also now (not the casting
   away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience
   towards God) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;

   22 Who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and
   dominions and powers being made subject to him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 4

   1 Christ then having suffered for us in the flesh, be ye also armed
   with the same mind: because he who hath suffered in the flesh hath
   ceased from sin;

   2 That he may no longer live the rest of his time in the flesh to the
   lusts of men, but to the will of God.

   3 For it is enough for us, that we have wrought, in the past time of
   life, the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
   lusts, excesses in wine, revellings, banquetings, and wicked
   idolatries:

   4 On account of which they think it strange, that ye run not with them
   into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you;

   5 Who shall give account to him who is ready to judge the living and
   the dead.

   6 For the gospel has for this end been also preached to the dead, that
   they may indeed be judged according to men in the flesh, but live
   according to God in the Spirit.

   7 But the end of all things is near; be ye then sober, and watchful to
   pray;

   8 And above all things having fervent love among yourselves; for love
   will cover a multitude of sins.

   9 Be hospitable towards one another, without murmurings.

   10 As every one has received a gift, minister the same one to another,
   as good dispensers of the manifold grace of God;

   11 If any one speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any one
   minister, let him do so as by the power which God supplies; that in all
   things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory
   and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

   12 Beloved, think it not strange when ye are tried by fire for the
   purpose of proving you, as though some new thing had happened to you;

   13 But inasmuch as ye are partakers of the sufferings of Christ,
   rejoice; that at the revelation also of his glory ye may exultingly
   rejoice.

   14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
   Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you: by them, indeed, he is
   slandered, but by you he is glorified.

   15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an
   evil-doer, or as a coveter of another man's goods; but if as a
   Christian, let him not be ashamed;

   16 Nay, let him in this case glorify God: for it is the time, when
   judgment begins at the house of God;

   17 But if it be first on us, what will be the end of those who obey not
   the gospel of God?

   18 And if the righteous be hardly saved, the ungodly and the sinner,
   where will they appear?

   19 Let therefore those who suffer according to the will of God, commit
   their souls to him, in doing good, as to a faithful possessor.

   CHAPTER 5

   1 The elders who are among you I exhort, who am also an elder and a
   witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker of the glory which
   shall be revealed:

   2 Feed as much as in you lieth the flock of God, discharging the office
   of bishops, not constrainedly, but willingly; not for the sake of
   filthy lucre, but liberally;

   3 And not as exercising tyranny over God's heritages, but that ye may
   be patterns to the flock:

   4 And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive an
   unfading crown of glory.

   5 In like manner the younger, be ye subject to the elder; yea, be ye
   all subject to one another: put ye on humility of mind; because God
   resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.

   6 Be ye then humbled under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
   you in due time;

   7 All your care being cast on him, for he cares for you.

   8 Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the Devil, as a
   roaring lion, goeth around, seeking whom he may devour:

   9 Whom resist ye, being firm in the faith, knowing that the same
   sufferings are accomplished in your brethren in the world.

   10 Now the God of all grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory
   through Christ Jesus, -- may he perfect you, while suffering for a
   short time, confirm, strengthen, and establish you:

   11 To him be the glory and the dominion, for ever and ever. Amen.

   12 By Sylvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written
   in a few words, exhorting you and testifying that this is the true
   grace of God in which ye stand.

   13 The church, elected together with you, which is in Babylon, saluteth
   you, and Marcus my son.

   14 Salute ye one another with the kiss of love. Grace be to you all who
   are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

   A Translation OF

   John Calvin's Version OF

   THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 What has been from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have
   seen with our eyes, what we have looked on, what our hands have
   handled, concerning the word of life;

   2 (And the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and do testify,
   and declare to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and
   has been manifested to us) --

   3 What we have seen and heard, declare we to you, that ye also may have
   fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his
   Son Jesus Christ:

   4 And we write these things to you, that your joy may be complete.

   5 And this is the message which we have heard from him, and declare to
   you, that God is light, and in him there is not any darkness.

   6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we
   lie, and do not tell the truth.

   7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
   fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
   cleanseth us from all sin.

   8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
   not in us:

   9 If we confess our sins, faithful is he and just, so as to forgive us
   our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness:

   10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word
   is not in us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 My little children, I write these things to you, that you may not
   sin; but if any one sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ, the righteous one:

   2 And he is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but
   also for the sins of the whole world.

   3 And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his
   commandments.

   4 He who says, "I know him," and keeps not his commandments, is a liar,
   and the truth is not in him:

   5 But he who keeps his word, verily in him the love of God is
   perfected;

   6 By this we know that we are in him. He who says that lie abides in
   him, ought also himself so to walk as he walked.

   7 Brethren, no new commandment do I write to you, but an old
   commandment, which you have had from the beginning: the old commandment
   is the word which you have heard from the beginning.

   8 Again, a new commandment do I write to you; which is true in him and
   in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light now
   shines.

   9 He who says that he is in the light, and hates his brother, is still
   in darkness.

   10 He who loves his brother abides in the light, and to him there is no
   stumbling:

   11 But lie who hates his brother, walks in darkness; and he knows not
   where he goeth, because darkness hath blinded his eyes.

   12 I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you
   for his name's sake.

   13 I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who is from the
   beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the
   wicked one. I write to you, children, because ye have known the Father.

   14 I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him who is
   from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are
   strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the
   evil one.

   15 Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world: if any
   one loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

   16 For whatever is in the world, (even the lust of the flesh, and the
   lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,) is not from the Father, but
   from the world.

   17 And the world passeth away, and the lust of it; but he who doeth the
   will of God, abides for ever.

   18 Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that
   Antichrist is to come, even now there are many Antichrist is:

   19 Hence we know that it is the last hour. From us have they gone out,
   but of us they were not, for had they been of us, they would surely
   have remained with us; but they have gone out, that they might be made
   manifest that they were not of us.

   20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.

   21 I have not written to you, because ye know not the truth, but
   because ye know it, and that everything false is not from the truth.

   22 Who is a liar, but he who denies Jesus to be the Christ? He is an
   Antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son:

   23 Every one who denies the Son hath not the Father.

   24 Let, then, what you have heard from the beginning remain in you: if
   what you have heard from the beginning remain in you, ye shall also
   remain in the Son, and in the Father;

   25 And this is the promise which he hath promised to us. even eternal
   life.

   26 These things have I written to you respecting them who seduce you:
   but the unction which ye have received from him remains in you, so that
   ye have no need that any one should teach you;

   27 But as the unction teaches you all things, and is truth, and is not
   a lie, and as it has taught you? so remain in him.

   28 And now, little children, continue in him, that when lie shall
   appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed at his presence.

   29 Since ye know that he is righteous, know ye that every one who doeth
   righteousness has been born of him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 3

   1 See what manner of love the Father hath bestowed on us, that we
   should be called the sons of God! the world for this reason knoweth us
   not, because it did not know him.

   2 Beloved, we are now the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what
   we shall be; but we know, that when lie shall appear, we shall be like
   him; for we shall see him as he is:

   3 And every one who hath this hope in him purifieth himself, inasmuch
   as he is pure.

   4 Whosoever doeth sin, doeth also iniquity; and sin is iniquity.

   5 But ye know that he appeared that he might take away our sins, and
   sin is not in him.

   6 Whosoever abides in him doth not sin; whosoever sins, hath not seen
   him, nor known him.

   7 Little children, let no one deceive you, -- he who doeth
   righteousness is righteous, inasmuch as he is righteous:

   8 He who doeth sin, is of the devil, for the devil sins from the
   beginning. The Son of God was for this end manifested, that he might
   undo the works of the devil.

   9 Whosoever has been born of God, doth not do sin, because his seed
   remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.

   10 By this are made manifest the sons of God, and the sons of the
   devil, -- every one who doeth not righteousness, is not of God, nor he
   who loves not his brother.

   11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we
   love one another:

   12 Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and slew his brother; and
   why did he slay him? because his works were evil, and his brother's
   righteous.

   13 Wonder not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

   14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the
   brethren; he who loves not his brother, remains in death.

   15 Every one who hates his brother, is a murderer; and ye know that no
   murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

   16 By this we know love, that he laid down his own life for us; and we
   ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

   17 But when any one has this world's goods, and seeth his brother in
   want, and closeth up his bowels from him, how abideth the love of God
   in him?

   18 My little children, let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in
   deed and in truth:

   19 And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our
   hearts before him.

   20 For if our heart accuse us, doubtless God is greater than our heart,
   and knoweth all things.

   21 Beloved, if our heart do not accuse us, we have confidence towards
   God:

   22 And if we ask anything, we receive it from him, because we keep his
   commandments, and do the things which are pleasing in his sight.

   23 And this is his commandment, that we believe on the name of his Son
   Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.

   24 And he who keepeth his commandment, abideth in him, and he in him;
   and by this we know that he abideth in us, even by the Spirit whom he
   hath given us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 4

   1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they
   are from God; because many false prophets have gone forth into the
   world.

   2 By this know ye the Spirit of God, -- Every spirit that confesseth
   that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is from God;

   3 And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the
   flesh, is not from God; and this is the Antichrist, of whom you have
   heard that he is to come, and he is now already in the world.

   4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because
   greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.

   5 They are of the world; therefore of the world do they speak, and the
   world heareth them.

   6 We are of God; he who knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God,
   doth not hear us: by this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of
   error.

   7 Beloved, let us love one another; because love is from God; and every
   one who loveth has been born of God, and knoweth God.

   8 He who loveth not, knoweth not God, because God is love.

   9 In this has appeared the love of God to us, that God has sent his
   only-begotten Son into the world, that we may live through him.

   10 In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that God has loved
   us and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.

   11 Beloved, if God has so loved us, we ought also to hive one another.

   12 No one hath ever seen God: if we love one another, God abides in us,
   and his love has been perfected in us.

   13 By this we know that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath
   given us of his Spirit.

   14 And we have seen and do testify, that the Father has sent his Son to
   be the Saviour of the world.

   15 He who shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in
   him, and he in God.

   16 And we have known and have believed the love which God hath to us:
   God is love; and he who abideth in love, abideth in God, and God in
   him.

   17 By this has love in us been perfected, that we may have confidence
   in the day of judgment, because as He is, so are we in this world.

   18 Fear is not in love: but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear
   hath torment; and he who fears, has not been perfected in love.

   19 We love him, because he has first loved us.

   20 If any one say, "I love God," and hate his neighbour, he is a liar;
   for he who loves not his brother whom he sees, how can he love God whom
   he sees not?

   21 And this commandment we have from Him, that he who loves God should
   also love his brother.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 5

   1 Every one who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God;
   and every one who loves Him who has begotten, loves him also who has
   been begotten by Him.

   2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God
   and keep his commandments:

   3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his
   commandments are not grievous.

   4 For, whatever has been born of God overcometh the world; and this is
   the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.

   5 Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is
   the Son of God?

   6 This is he who has come by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not by
   water only, but by water and blood; and the Spirit is

   7 He who testifies, inasmuch as the Spirit is truth. For there are
   three who testify in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit;
   and these three are one.

   8 And there are three who testify on earth, the Spirit, the water, and
   the blood;

   9 And these three agree in one. If we receive the testimony of men, the
   testimony of God is greater.

   10 Moreover, this is the testimony of God, which lie hath testified
   respecting his own Son (He who believes on the Son of God hath the
   testimony in himself;

   11 He who believes not God, makes him a liar, because he hath not
   believed the testimony which God hath testified respecting his own
   Son,) even this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal
   life;

   12 And this life is in his Son. He who hath the Son, hath life; he who
   hath not the Son of God, hath not life.

   13 These things have I written to you who believe on the name of the
   Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may
   believe on the name of the Son of God.

   14 And this is the confidence which we have towards Him, that when we
   ask anything according to his will, he heareth us:

   15 And if we know that he hears us when we ask any thing, we know that
   we have the petitions which we have desired of him.

   16 If any one see his brother sinning a sin not to death, he shall ask,
   and he will give to him life for him who sins not to death: there is a
   sin to death, I do not say that any one shall pray for that.

   17 Every unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not to death.

   18 We know that every one who has been born of God, sins not; but he
   who has been born of God, keeps himself, and the wicked one touches him
   not.

   19 We know that we are of God; and the whole world lieth in the wicked
   one.

   20 And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given to us an
   understanding, that we may know him who is true; anti we are in him who
   is true, in his Son Jesus Christ: this is the true God and eternal
   life.

   21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

   A TRANSLATION OF

   CALVIN'S VERSION OF

   THE EPISTLE OF JAMES.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve
   tribes which are in the dispersion, health:

   2 Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various temptations;

   3 Knowing that the trying of your faith works patience:

   4 But let patience have its perfect work, so that ye may be perfect and
   entire, in nothing deficient.

   5 But if any of you be deficient in wisdom, let him ask it from God,
   who giveth to all freely, and does not upbraid: and it shall be given
   to him.

   6 But let him ask in faith, by no means doubting; for he who doubts, is
   like a wave of the sea, which by the wind is driven and tossed to and
   fro.

   7 Let not, then, that man think that he shall receive anything from the
   Lord.

   8 A man of a double mind is unstable in all his ways.

   9 Now, let a brother who is low, rejoice in his exaltation; and the
   rich in his lowness:

   10 Because as a flower of grass shall he pass away:

   11 For the sun rises with heat and withers the grass, and the flower
   falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes; so also shall the
   rich fade away in his riches.

   12 Blessed is the man, who endures temptation; for when he is tried, he
   shall receive the crown of life: which the Lord hath promised to them
   who love him.

   13 Let no one, when he is tempted, say, "By God I am tempted:" for God
   cannot be tempted by evils, nor does he tempt any one.

   14 But every one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lusts,
   and is ensnared.

   15 Then lust, having conceived, brings forth sin; and sin, being
   perfected, begets death.

   16 Do not err, my beloved brethren:

   17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, descending
   from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change nor shadow of
   turning.

   18 Of his own will has he begotten us by the word of truth, that we
   might be some firstfruits of his creatures.

   19 Let every man, therefore, my beloved brethren, be swift to hear,
   slow to speak, slow to wrath:

   20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

   21 Laying aside then all filthiness and redundancy of wickedness,
   receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your
   souls.

   22 And be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving
   yourselves.

   23 For if any one be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a
   man who looks on his natural face in a glass;

   24 For he hath looked on himself and departed, and hath immediately
   forgotten what manner of man he was.

   25 But he who attentively looks on the perfect law of liberty and
   continues to do so,--this man, being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer
   of the work, shall be blessed in his work.

   26 If any one seems to be religious among you and bridleth not his
   tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, his religion is vain.

   27 Pure religion and undefiled before God even the Father, is this,--To
   visit the orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep himself
   unspotted from the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect
   of persons on account of reputation.

   2 For if there enter into your assembly a man wearing gold rings,
   having on a splendid dress, and there enter in also a poor man in
   sordid clothing;

   3 And ye have respect to him who wears a splendid dress, and say to
   him, "Sit thou here honorably," and ye say to the poor, "Stand thou
   there," or, "Sit here under my foot- stool;"

   4 Are ye not condemned in yourselves, and become judges of evil
   thoughts?

   5 Hear, my beloved brethren, Has not God chosen the poor of this world
   to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to
   them who love Him?

   6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not the rich domineer over you, and
   draw you before judgment-seats?

   7 Do they not blaspheme the good name which is called on you?

   8 If indeed ye fulfill the royal law, according to Scripture,

   9 "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," ye do well: but if ye
   respect persons, ye commit sin, and are reproved by the law as
   transgressors.

   10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one thing,
   becomes guilty of all:

   11 For he who hath said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," hath said
   also, "Thou shalt not kill." Now if thou committest no adultery, yet if
   thou killest, thou becomest a transgressor of the law.

   12 So speak ye and so do, as those who shall be judged by the law of
   liberty.

   13 For judgment will be without mercy to him who hath not shewed mercy;
   and mercy glorieth against judgment.

   14 What does it avail, my brethren, if any one say that he hath faith,
   and have not works? Can faith save him?

   15 Now, if a brother or a sister be naked and in want of daily bread,
   and one of you say to them, "Go away in peace, be warmed and be
   filled;"

   16 Though ye give them not those things which are necessary for the
   body, what does it avail?

   17 Even so faith, if it hath no works, being by itself, is dead.

   18 Nay, rather, one may say, "Thou hast faith and I have works; shew me
   thy faith without thy works, and I will by my works shew thee my
   faith."

   19 Then believest that there is one God; thou doest right: the devils
   also believe and tremble.

   20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?

   21 Abraham our father, was he not justified by works, when he offered
   up Isaac his son on the altar?

   22 Seest thou that faith co-operated with his works, and faith was by
   works made perfect?

   23 And fulfilled was the Scripture which saith, "Abraham believed God,
   and it was counted to him for righteousness:" and he was called the
   Friend of God

   24 Ye then see, that by works is man justified, and not by faith only

   25 In like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by
   works, when she received the messengers, and sent them forth another
   way?

   26 For as the body without the soul is dead, so also faith without
   works is dead.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 3

   1 Be not many masters, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive
   greater judgment:

   2 For in many things we all offend. If any one offend not in word, he
   is a perfect man, as one who can bridle also the whole body.

   3 Behold, we put bridles in horses' months, that they may obey us, and
   we turn about their whole body.

   4 Behold also the ships, however large they may be and driven by fierce
   winds, yet they are turned about by a very small helm wherever the will
   of the pilot wishes.

   5 So also the tongue is a very small member and boasts great things.

   6 Behold, a little fire, what quantity of wood it burns! And the tongue
   is a fire, and a world of iniquity. So is the tongue among our members;
   it defiles the whole body and sets on fire the whole course of nature,
   and it is set on fire by hell.

   7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of
   things in the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind:

   8 But the tongue no man can tame, an unrestrainable evil, full of
   deadly poison.

   9 By it we bless God, even the Father; and by it we curse men made
   after his likeness!

   10 From the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing! These things, my
   brethren, ought not to be so.

   11 Does a fountain from the same opening send forth the sweet and the
   bitter?

   12 Can a fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive-berries; or a vine, figs? so
   no fountain can bring forth briny and sweet water.

   13 Who is wise and intelligent among you? Let him shew by a good
   conduct his works with meekness of wisdom.

   14 But if ye have bitter emulation and contention in your heart, glory
   not, and lie not against the truth.

   15 This is not the wisdom which comes from above, but earthly, animal,
   demoniacal:

   16 For where emulation and contention are, there is confusion and every
   evil work.

   17 But the wisdom which is from above, is first pure, then peaceable,
   humane, tractable, full of mercy and of good works, not officiously
   prying, not dissembling:

   18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make
   peace.

   CHAPTER 4

   1 Whence wars and fightings among you? are they not hence,--from your
   lusts which war in your members?

   2 Ye covet and have not; ye envy and emulate, and cannot obtain; ye
   fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye do not ask;

   3 Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend it on
   your lusts.

   4 Adulterers and adulteresses! know ye not, that the friendship of the
   world is enmity to God? Whosoever then will be a friend of the world,
   becomes the enemy of God.

   5 Do ye think that the Scripture speaks in vain? Does the Spirit who
   dwells in us, lust to envy?

   6 Nay, he giveth more grace: hence He saith, God resists the proud, but
   giveth grace to the humble.

   7 Be ye then subject to God; resist the devil and he will flee from
   you.

   8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you: cleanse your hands,
   ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.

   9 Be afflicted and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned to
   mourning, and your joy to sorrow.

   10 Be humbled before God, and he will exalt you.

   11 Defame not one another, brethren; he who defames a brother and
   judges his brother, defames the law and judges the law; but if thou
   judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.

   12 One is the lawgiver, who can save and destroy; who art thou who
   judgest another?

   13 Come now ye who say, "To-day, or, to-morrow, we shall go into the
   city and pass there a year, and trade and make gain:" who know not what
   is to be to-morrow; for what is your life?

   14 It is indeed a vapor, which for a short time appears, and then
   vanishes away.

   15 On the contrary ye ought to say, "If the Lord will, and we live, we
   shall do this or that." But now ye glory in your presumptions: all such
   glorying is evil. He then who knows to do good and doeth it not, is
   guilty of sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 5

   1 Come now ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries, which shall come
   upon you.

   2 Your riches are become rotten, and your garments are eaten by moths;

   3 Your gold and silver are rusted, and their rust will be a witness
   against you, and shall eat all your flesh as fire: ye have heaped
   together a treasure for the last days.

   4 Behold the wages of the workmen, who have reaped your fields,
   fraudulently kept back by you, loudly cry; and the cries of those who
   have been reaping have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.

   5 In pleasures have ye lived on the earth, and have been wanton; ye
   have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.

   6 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he does not resist you.

   7 Be patient then, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the
   husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, having long
   patience for it, until he receives the early and the latter rain.

   8 Be ye then also patient; strengthen your hearts; because the coming
   of the Lord is nigh.

   9 Groan not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned;
   behold, the Judge stands before the door.

   10 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the
   Lord, as an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.

   11 Behold, we count them blessed who endure: ye have heard of the
   patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, that he is very
   merciful and compassionate.

   12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor
   by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let yours be, yea, yea; no,
   no; lest ye fall into condemnation.

   13 Is any one afflicted among you? let him pray: is any cheerful? let
   him sing psalms:

   14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church;
   and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
   Lord;

   15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall
   raise him up: and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven
   him.

   16 Confess mutually your sins, and pray for one another, that ye may be
   healed: the efficacious prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

   17 Elias was a man subject to passions in the like manner as we; and he
   earnestly prayed that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth
   for three years and six months:

   18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought
   forth its fruit.

   19 My brethren, if any one among you err from the truth, and some one
   convert him;

   20 Let him know, that he who converts a sinner from the error of his
   way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.

   A Translation Of

   Calvin's Version OF

   THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 Simeon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who
   have obtained an equally precious faith with us, through the
   righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ;

   2 Grace to you and peace be multiplied, through the knowledge of God,
   and of Jesus our Lord;

   3 As his divine power has given us all things which pertain to life and
   godliness, through the knowledge of him who hath called us by his own
   glory and power;

   4 By which also very great and precious promises have been freely given
   us, that through these ye might become partakers of the divine nature,
   having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

   5 And for this purpose using all diligence, add to your faith, virtue;
   and to virtue, knowledge;

   6 And to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to
   patience, godliness;

   7 And to godliness, brotherly affection; and to brotherly affection,
   love:

   8 For if these be in you, and be abounding, they make you to be neither
   idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ;

   9 But he in whom these things are wanting is blind, and cannot see afar
   off, having forgotten the cleansing of his old sins.

   10 Therefore, brethren, strive the more to make your calling and
   election sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:

   11 For thus shall abundantly be supplied to you an entrance into the
   eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

   12 I will not, therefore, neglect always to remind you of these things,
   though ye know them, and have been confirmed in the present truth.

   13 Yea, I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
   you up by reminding you;

   14 Since I know that I am shortly to put away this tabernacle, as also
   our Lord Jesus Christ hath made manifest to me.

   15 I will, however, endeavor, that ye may also be able to have these
   things always in remembrance after my departure.

   16 For it was not cunningly-devised fables that we followed, when we
   made known to you the power and the corning of our Lord Jesus Christ;
   but we were eye-witnesses of his majesty:

   17 For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when such a
   voice as this came to him from the magnificent glory, "This is my
   beloved Son, in whom I have been well pleased."

   18 And this voice we heard, when we were with him on the holy mount.

   19 And we have the more sure word of prophecy, to which ye do well in
   attending, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawn,
   and the day-star arise in your hearts;

   20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of a
   private suggestion:

   21 For prophecy came not formerly by the will of man; but holy men of
   God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 There were, however, false prophets also among the people; as there
   will also be false teachers among you, who will stealthily bring in
   opinions of perdition, denying even the Lord who has redeemed them,
   bringing on themselves swift destruction.

   2 And many shall follow their ruinous courses, through whom the way of
   truth shall be blasphemed.

   3 And through avarice they shall make a trade of you by feigned words;
   whose judgment a long ago ceases not, and whose perdition does not
   slumber.

   4 For if God spared not the angels who had sinned, but having cast them
   into hell in chains of darkness, delivered them to be kept for
   judgment;

   5 And if he spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth
   person, a preacher of righteousness, having brought in the flood on the
   world of the ungodly;

   6 And if having turned into ashes the cities of the Sodomites and of
   Gomorrah, he condemned them with an overthrew, having made them an
   example to those who would live ungodly,

   7 And delivered the righteous Lot, who was vexed by the wicked through
   their lascivious conduct;

   8 For that righteous man, while dwelling among them, had by seeing and
   hearing his righteous soul daily tormented by their iniquitous deeds;

   9 The Lord. knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to
   reserve the unjust for the day of judgment to be punished;

   10 And especially those who walk after the flesh in the lust of
   uncleanness, and despise government: audacious and refractory, they
   fear not to blaspheme dignities,

   11 When angels, who are greater in strength and power, bring no railing
   judgment against them before the Lord.

   12 But these, as brute animals, naturally made to be taken and
   destroyed, blaspheming those things which they understand not, shall
   perish in their own corruption, receiving the reward of
   unrighteousness;

   13 Deeming riot in the day-time a pleasure, they are blots and stains,
   rioting in their own errors, while feasting with you;

   14 Having eyes full of adultery, which cease not from sin, ensnaring
   unstable souls, having a heart exercised in lusts, accursed children;

   15 Who having left the right way, have gone astray, following the way
   of Balaam, the son of Bosor, who loved the reward of unrighteousness;

   16 But was reproved for his iniquity; a mute beast of burden, speaking
   with the human voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.

   17 These are fountains without, water, clouds driven by a tempest, for
   whom has been prepared thick darkness for ever.

   18 For when they speak most haughty words of vanity, they ensnare
   through the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who had really
   escaped from such as live in error;

   19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the slaves of
   corruption; for by whom any one is overcome, to him is he brought into
   bondage.

   20 For if they who had escaped from the pollutions of the world,
   through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, become
   again entangled with these, and are overcome, the last pollutions
   become worse to them than the former:

   21 For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of
   righteousness, than to have known it, and to turn away from the holy
   commandment delivered to them.

   22 But what is said in the true proverb has happened to them, "The dog
   has returned to his own vomit, and the washen sow to her wallowing in
   the mire."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 3

   1 This second Epistle, beloved, I now write to you; in both which I
   stir up your pure mind by admonition,

   2 That ye may remember the words which have been foretold by the holy
   Prophets and the commandment of us who are the apostles of the Lord and
   Savior;

   3 Knowing this first, that scoffers will come in the last days, walking
   according to their own lusts,

   4 And saying, "Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
   fathers have slept, all things remain as from the beginning of the
   creation."

   5 For of this they are wilfully ignorant, that by the word of God the
   heavens were formerly, and the earth, subsisting by water and through
   water;

   6 Through which the world, which then was, perished, being overflowed
   with water.

   7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, are reserved by the
   word of the same, and are kept for fire against the day of judgment and
   of the perdition of the ungodly.

   8 But of this one thing, beloved, be ye not ignorant, that one day with
   the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

   9 The Lord does not delay as to his promise, as some count delay, but
   is patient towards us, not willing that any should perish, but that all
   should come to repentance.

   10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which
   the heavens with a tempest shall pass away, and the elements shall melt
   with heat, and the earth and all its works shall be burnt up.

   11 Since then all these things shall be dissolved, what ought we to be
   in all holy conduct and all godliness;

   12 Waiting in haste for the coming of the day of God; on account of
   which the heavens being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements
   shall be consumed with heat.

   13 But according to his promise we look for new heavens and a new
   earth, in which righteousness dwells.

   14 Therefore, beloved, since ye look for these things, labor to be
   found by him in peace, unpolluted and blameless;

   15 And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation, as also our
   beloved brother Paul has written to you according to the wisdom given
   to him; as also in all his Epistles, speaking of these things; in which
   there are some things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and
   the unstable pervert,

   16 As also other scriptures, to their own ruin.

   17 Do ye then, beloved, being forewarned, take heed, lest ye, being led
   away by the error of the wicked, should fall from your own
   steadfastness.

   18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
   Christ: to him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

   A translation of

   John Calvin's Version

   The Epistle of Jude.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and the brother of James, to the
   called, who are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved by Jesus
   Christ;

   2 Mercy to you and peace and love be increased.

   3 Beloved, when I was applying all care to write to you of the common
   salvation, I deemed it necessary to write to you in order to exhort
   you, that ye should by contending help the faith once delivered to the
   saints.

   4 For crept in stealthily have certain men, ordained of old to this
   judgment, ungodly, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness,
   and denying God, the only sovereign, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

   5 Now I wish to remind you, though ye once knew this, that the Lord,
   after having saved the people from the land of Egypt, afterwards
   destroyed the unbelieving;

   6 And the angels, who had not kept their own pre-eminence, but left
   their own abode, he has reserved under darkness in eternal chains for
   the judgment of the great day.

   7 As Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities around them, having in like
   manner committed fornication and gone after strange flesh, have been
   set forth for an example, undergoing the judgment of eternal fire:

   8 In like manner also do these, deluded with dreams, pollute the flesh,
   reject government, and heap curses on dignities:

   9 Yet Michael the archangel, when, contending with the devil, he
   disputed about the body of Moses, dared not to bring against him a
   reviling judgment, but said,

   10 "The Lord rebuke thee." But these revile those things which they
   know not, but what things they know naturally, as brute beasts; in
   these they corrupt themselves.

   11 Woe to them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and abandoned
   themselves to the error of Balaam's reward, and perished in the
   gainsaying of Core.

   12 These are stains in your brotherly feasts, feasting with you,
   heedlessly feeding themselves; clouds without water, driven about by
   winds; withering trees of autumn, fruitless, twice dead, rooted up;

   13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering
   stars, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever:

   14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, formerly prophesied of these,
   saying, "Behold, the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints,

   15 To execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of the
   ungodly deeds of ungodliness which they have in an ungodly manner done,
   and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against
   God."

   16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and
   their mouth speaks swelling words, admiring persons for the sake of
   gain.

   17 But ye, beloved, remember the words which have been spoken before by
   the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

   18 For they have told you, that in the last time scoffers would come,
   walking after their own ungodly lusts.

   19 These are they who separate themselves, being sensual, having not
   the Spirit.

   20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,
   praying in the Holy Spirit,

   21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our
   Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

   22 And on some have mercy, making a difference;

   23 But others save by fear, snatching them from the fire, hating even
   the garment spotted by the flesh.

   24 Now to him who can keep you free from sin and set you faultless
   before the presence of his glory with exultation

   25 To the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and
   power, both now and to all ages. Amen.
