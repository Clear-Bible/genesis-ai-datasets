     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 1

   1:1 Forasmuch as [epeideper]. Here alone in the N.T., though common in
   literary Attic. Appears in the papyri. A triple compound [epei] =
   since, [de] = admittedly true, [per] = intensive particle to emphasize
   importance). Many [polloi]. How many no one knows, but certainly more
   than two or three. We know that Luke used the Logia of Jesus written by
   Matthew in Aramaic (Papias) and Mark's Gospel. Undoubtedly he had other
   written sources. Have taken in hand [epecheiresan]. A literal
   translation of [epicheireO] (from [cheir], hand and [epi], upon). Both
   Hippocrates and Galen use this word in their introduction to their
   medical works. Here only in the N.T., though a common literary word.
   Common in the papyri for undertaking with no idea of failure or blame.
   Luke does not mean to cast reflection on those who preceded him. The
   apocryphal gospels were all much later and are not in his mind. Luke
   had secured fuller information and planned a book on a larger scale and
   did surpass them with the result that they all perished save Mark's
   Gospel and what Matthew and Luke possess of the Logia of Jesus. There
   was still room for Luke's book. That motive influences every author and
   thus progress is made. To draw up, a narrative [anataxasthai diegesin].
   Ingressive aorist middle infinitive. This verb [anataxasthai] has been
   found only in Plutarch's Moral. 968 CD about an elephant "rehearsing"
   by moonlight certain tricks it had been taught (Moulton and Milligan,
   Vocabulary). That was from memory going regularly through the thing
   again. But the idea in the word is plain enough. The word is composed
   of [tassO], a common verb for arranging things in proper order and
   [ana], again. Luke means to say that those before him had made attempts
   to rehearse in orderly fashion various matters about Christ. "The
   expression points to a connected series of narratives in some order
   [taxis], topical or chronological rather than to isolated narratives"
   (Bruce). "They had produced something more than mere notes or
   anecdotes" (Plummer). [Diegesis] means leading or carrying a thing
   through, not a mere incident. Galen applies this word some seventy-five
   times to the writing of Hippocrates. Which have been fulfilled [tOn
   peplerOphoremenOn]. Perfect passive participle from [plerophoreO] and
   that from [pleres] (full) and [pherO] (to bring). Hence to bring or
   make full. The verb is rare outside of the LXX and the N.T. Papyri
   examples occur for finishing off a legal matter or a financial matter
   in full. Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, pp. 86f.) gives
   examples from the papyri and inscriptions for completing a task or
   being convinced or satisfied in mind. The same ambiguity occurs here.
   When used of persons in the N.T. the meaning is to be convinced, or
   fully persuaded (Ro 4:21; 14:5; Heb 6:11; 10:22). When used of things
   it has the notion of completing or finishing (2Ti 4:5, 17). Luke is
   here speaking of "matters" [pragmatOn]. Luke may refer to the matters
   connected with Christ's life which have been brought to a close among
   us or accomplished. Bruce argues plausibly that he means fulness of
   knowledge "concerning the things which have become widely known among
   us Christians." In Col 2:2 we have "fulness of understanding" [tes
   plerophorias tes suneseOs]. In modern Greek the verb means to inform.
   The careful language of Luke here really pays a tribute to those who
   had preceded him in their narratives concerning Christ.

   1:2 Even as [kathOs]. This particle was condemned by the Atticists
   though occurring occasionally from Aristotle on. It is in the papyri.
   Luke asserts that the previous narratives had their sound basis.
   Delivered unto us [paredOsan hemin]. Second aorist active indicative of
   [paradidOmi]. Luke received this tradition along with those who are
   mentioned above (the many). That is he was not one of the
   "eyewitnesses." He was a secondary, not a primary, witness of the
   events. Tradition has come to have a meaning of unreliability with us,
   but that is not the idea here. Luke means to say that the handing down
   was dependable, not mere wives' fables. Those who drew up the
   narratives had as sources of knowledge those who handed down the data.
   Here we have both written and oral sources. Luke had access to both
   kinds. Which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the
   word [hoi ap' arches autoptai kai huperetai genomenoi tou logou]. "Who"
   is better than "which" for the article here. The word for eyewitnesses
   [autoptai] is an old Greek word and appears in the papyri also. It
   means seeing with one's own eyes. It occurs here only in the N.T. We
   have the very word in the medical term autopsy.Greek medical writers
   often had the word. It is a different word from [epoptai] (eyewitness)
   in 2Pe 1:16, a word used of those who beheld heavenly mysteries. The
   word for "ministers" [huperetai], under rowers or servants we have had
   already in Mt 5:25; 26:58; Mr 14:54, 65, which see. We shall see it
   again in Lu 4:20 of the attendant in the synagogue. In the sense of a
   preacher of the gospel as here, it occurs also in Ac 26:16. Here "the
   word" means the gospel message, as in Ac 6:4; 8:4, etc. From the
   beginning apparently refers to the beginning of the ministry of Jesus
   as was true of the apostles (Ac 1:22) and of the early apostolic
   preaching (Ac 10:37-43). The Gospel of Mark follows this plan. The
   Gospel of Luke goes behind this in chapters 1 and 2 as does Matthew in
   chapters 1 and 2. But Luke is not here referring to himself. The
   matters about the childhood of Jesus Christ would not form part of the
   traditional preaching for obvious reasons.

   1:3 It seemed good to me also [edoxe kamoi]. A natural conclusion and
   justification of Luke's decision to write his narrative. They had ample
   reason to draw up their narratives. Luke has more reason to do so
   because of his fuller knowledge and wider scope. Having traced the
   course of all things [parekolouthekoti pasin]. The perfect active
   participle of a common verb of the ancient Greek. Literally it means to
   follow along a thing in mind, to trace carefully. Both meanings occur
   abundantly in the ancient Greek. Cadbury (Appendix C to Beginnings of
   Christianity, Vol. II, pp. 489ff.) objects to the translation "having
   traced" here as implying research which the word does not here mean.
   Milligan (Vocabulary) is somewhat impressed by this argument. See my
   discussion of the point in Chapter XVI of Studies in the Text of the
   N.T. (The Implications in Luke's Preface) where the point is made that
   Luke here claims fulness of knowledge before he began to write his
   book. He had the traditions of the eyewitnesses and ministers of the
   word and the narratives previously drawn up. Whether he was a personal
   contemporary with any or all of these events we do not know and it is
   not particularly pertinent. He had mentally followed along by the side
   of these events. Galen used this verb for the investigation of
   symptoms. Luke got himself ready to write before he began by full and
   accurate knowledge of the subject. [AkribOs] (accurately) means going
   into minute details, from [akron], the topmost point. And he did it
   from the first [anOthen]. He seems to refer to the matters in Chapters
   1:5-2:52, the Gospel of the Infancy. In order [kathexes]. Chronological
   order in the main following Mark's general outline. But in 9:51-18:10
   the order is often topical. He has made careful investigation and his
   work deserves serious consideration. Most excellent Theophilus
   [kratiste Theophile]. The name means god-lover or god-beloved. He may
   have been a believer already. He was probably a Gentile. Ramsay holds
   that "most excellent" was a title like "Your Excellency" and shows that
   he held office, perhaps a Knight. So of Felix (Ac 23:26) and Festus (Ac
   26:25). The adjective does not occur in the dedication in Ac 1:1.

   1:4 Mightest know [epignOis]. Second aorist active subjunctive of
   [epiginOskO]. Full knowledge [epi-], in addition to what he already
   has. The certainty [ten asphaleian]. Make no slip [sphallO], to totter
   or fall, and [a] privative). Luke promises a reliable narrative.
   "Theophilus shall know that the faith which he has embraced has an
   impregnable historical foundation" (Plummer). The things [logOn].
   Literally "words," the details of the words in the instruction. Wast
   instructed [katechethes]. First aorist passive indicative. Not in O.T.
   and rare in ancient Greek. Occurs in the papyri. The word [echeO] is
   our word echo (cf. 1Th 1:8 for [exechetai], has sounded forth).
   [KatecheO] is to sound down, to din, to instruct, to give oral
   instruction. Cf. 1Co 14:9; Ac 21:21,24; 18:25; Gal 6:6. Those men doing
   the teaching were called catechists and those receiving it were called
   catechumens.Whether Theophilus was still a catechumen is not known.
   This Preface by Luke is in splendid literary Koine and is not surpassed
   by those in any Greek writer (Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius). It is
   entirely possible that Luke was familiar with this habit of Greek
   historians to write prefaces since he was a man of culture.

   1:5 There was [egeneto]. Not the usual [en] for "was," but there arose
   or came into notice. With this verse the literary Koine of verses 1 to
   4 disappears. To the end of chapter 2 we have the most Hebraistic
   (Aramaic) passage in Luke's writings, due evidently to the use of
   documents or notes of oral tradition. Plummer notes a series of such
   documents ending with 1:80, 2:40, 2:52. If the mother of Jesus was
   still alive, Luke could have seen her. She may have written in Aramaic
   an account of these great events. Natural reserve would keep her from
   telling too much and from too early publicity. Luke, as a physician,
   would take special interest in her birth report. The supernatural
   aspects disturb only those who do not admit the real Incarnation of
   Jesus Christ and who are unable to believe that God is superior to
   nature and that the coming of the Son of God to earth justifies such
   miraculous manifestations of divine power. Luke tells his story from
   the standpoint of Mary as Matthew gives his from the standpoint of
   Joseph. The two supplement each other. We have here the earliest
   documentary evidence of the origins of Christianity that has come down
   to us (Plummer). Herod, King of Judea [HerOidou basileOs tes Ioudaias].
   This note of time locates the events before the death of Herod the
   Great (as he was called later), appointed King of Judea by the Roman
   Senate B.C. 40 at the suggestion of Octavius and Antony. He died B.C.
   4. Of the course of Abijah [ex ephemerias Abia]. Not in old Greek, but
   in LXX and modern Greek. Papyri have a verb derived from it,
   [ephemereO]. Daily service (Ne 13:30; 1Ch 25:8) and then a course of
   priests who were on duty for a week (1Ch 23:6; 28:13). There were 24
   such courses and that of Abijah was the eighth (1Ch 24:10; 2Ch 8:14).
   Only four of these courses (Jedaiah, Immer, Pashur, Harim) returned
   from Babylon, but these four were divided into twenty-four with the old
   names. Each of these courses did duty for eight days, sabbath to
   sabbath, twice a year. On sabbaths the whole course did duty. At the
   feast of tabernacles all twenty-four courses were present. Of the
   daughters of Aaron [ek tOn thugaterOn AarOn]. "To be a priest and
   married to a priest's daughter was a double distinction" (Plummer).
   Like a preacher married to a preacher's daughter.

   1:6 Righteous before God [dikaioi enantion tou theou]. Old Testament
   conception and idiom. Cf. 2:25 about Simeon. Expanded in Old Testament
   language. Picture of "noblest product of Old Testament education"
   (Ragg) is Zacharias and Elisabeth, Mary and Joseph, Simeon and Anna who
   were "privileged to see with clear eyes the dawn of the New Testament
   revelation."

   1:7 Because that [kathoti]. Good Attic word, according to what. Only in
   Luke and Acts in the N.T. In the papyri. Well stricken in years
   [probebekotes en tais hemerais autOn]. Wycliff has it right: "Had gone
   far in their days." Perfect active participle. See also verse 18.

   1:8 While he executed the priest's office [en tOi hierateuein auton]. A
   favourite idiom in Luke, [en] with the articular infinitive and the
   accusative of general reference where the genitive absolute could have
   been used or a temporal conjunction and finite verb. It is proper
   Greek, but occurs often in the LXX, which Luke read, particularly in
   imitation of the Hebrew infinitive construct. The word [hierateuO] does
   not appear in the ancient Greek, but in the LXX and this one example in
   Luke. It is on the Rosetta Stone and the early inscriptions so that the
   word was simply applied by the LXX translators from current usage.

   1:9 His lot was [elache]. Literally, he obtained the lot. Second aorist
   active indicative of [lagchanO], to obtain by lot, a very old verb from
   Homer on. It is used either with the genitive as here, or the
   accusative as in Ac 1:17; 2Pe 1:1. Papyri show examples with the
   accusative. It was only once in a lifetime that a priest obtained the
   lot of going [eiselthOn], here nominative aorist active participle
   agreeing with the subject of [elache] into the sanctuary [ton naon],
   not [to hieron], the outer courts) and burning incense on the golden
   altar. "It was the great moment of Zacharias's life, and his heart was
   no doubt alert for the supernatural" (Ragg). The fortunate lot was "a
   white stone" to which Re 2:17 may refer. Burn incense [tou thumiasai].
   Here only in the N.T. Occurs on inscriptions. Hobart finds it used by
   medical writers for fumigating herbs. "Ascending the steps to the Holy
   Place, the priests spread the coals on the golden altar, and arranged
   the incense, and the chief operating priest was then left alone within
   the Holy Place to await the signal of the president to burn the
   incense. It was probably at this time that the angel appeared to
   Zacharias" (Vincent).

   1:10 Were praying without [en proseuchomenon exO]. Periphrastic
   imperfect indicative picturing the posture of the people while the
   clouds of incense rose on the inside of the sanctuary.

   1:11 Appeared [Ophthe]. First aorist passive indicative. It is the form
   used by Paul of the resurrection appearances of Jesus (1Co 15:5-8).
   There is no use in trying to explain away the reality of the angel. We
   must choose between admitting an objective appearance and a myth
   (Plummer).

   1:13 Is heard [eisekousthe]. First aorist passive indicative. A sort of
   timeless aorist, "was heard" when made, and so "is heard" now. Probably
   the prayer was for a son in spite of the great age of Elisabeth, though
   the Messianic redemption is possible also. John [IOanen]. The word
   means that God is gracious. The mention of the name should have helped
   Zacharias to believe. The message of the angel (verses 13-17) takes on
   a metrical form when turned into Hebrew (Ragg) and it is a prose poem
   in Greek and English like 1:30-33, 35-37, 42-45, 46-55, 68-70; 2:10-12,
   14, 29-32, 34-35. Certainly Luke has preserved the earliest Christian
   hymns in their oldest sources. He is the first critic of the sources of
   the Gospels and a scholarly one.

   1:14 Gladness [agalliasis]. Only in the LXX and N.T. so far as known. A
   word for extreme exultation. Rejoice [charesontai]. Second future
   passive indicative. The coming of a prophet will indeed be an occasion
   for rejoicing.

   1:15 Strong drink [sikera]. A Hebrew word transliterated into Greek, an
   intoxicating drink. Here only in the N.T. John was to be a personal
   "dry" or Nazarite (Nu 6:3). Shall not drink [ou me piei]. Strong
   prohibition, double negative and second aorist subjunctive. The Holy
   Ghost [pneumatos hagiou]. The Holy Spirit in contrast to the physical
   excitement of strong drink (Plummer). Luke uses this phrase 53 times,
   12 in the Gospel, Mark and John 4 each, Matthew 5 times. Even from his
   mother's womb [eti ek koilias metros autou]. A manifest Hebraism. Cf.
   verse 41.

   1:17 Before his face [enOpion autou]. Not in the ancient Greek, but
   common in the papyri as in LXX and N.T. It is a vernacular Koine word,
   adverb used as preposition from adjective [enOpios], and that from [ho
   en Opi On] (the one who is in sight). Autou here seems to be "the Lord
   their God" in verse 16 since the Messiah has not yet been mentioned,
   though he was to be actually the Forerunner of the Messiah. In the
   spirit and power of Elijah [en pneumati kai dunamei Eleia]. See Isa
   40:1-11; Mal 3:1-5. John will deny that he is actually Elijah in
   person, as they expected (Joh 1:21), but Jesus will call him Elijah in
   spirit (Mr 9:12; Mt 17:12). Hearts of fathers [kardias paterOn].
   Paternal love had died out. This is one of the first results of
   conversion, the revival of love in the home. Wisdom [phronesei]. Not
   [sophia], but a word for practical intelligence. Prepared
   [kateskeuasmenon]. Perfect passive participle, state of readiness for
   Christ. This John did. This is a marvellous forecast of the character
   and career of John the Baptist, one that should have caught the faith
   of Zacharias.

   1:18 Whereby [kata ti]. According to what. It was too good to be true
   and Zacharias demanded proof and gives the reason (for, [gar] for his
   doubt. He had prayed for this blessing and was now sceptical like the
   disciples in the house of Mary about the return of Peter (Ac 12:14f.).

   1:19 Gabriel [Gabriel]. The Man of God (Da 8:6; 9:21). The other angel
   whose name is given in Scripture is Michael (Da 10:13,21; Jude 1:9; Re
   12:7). The description of himself is a rebuke to the doubt of
   Zacharias.

   1:20 Thou shalt be silent [esei siOpOn]. Volitive future periphrastic.
   Not able to speak [me dunamenos lalesai]. Negative repetition of the
   same statement. His dumbness will continue "until" [achri hes hemeras]
   the events come to pass "because" [anth' hOn]. The words were to become
   reality in due season [kairon], not [chronos], time).

   1:21 Were waiting [en prosdokOn]. Periphrastic imperfect again. An old
   Greek verb for expecting. Appears in papyri and inscriptions. It
   denotes mental direction whether hope or fear. They marvelled
   [ethaumazon]. Imperfect tense, were wondering. The Talmud says that the
   priest remained only a brief time in the sanctuary. While he tarried
   [en tOi chronizein]. See verse 8 for the same idiom.

   1:22 Perceived [epegnOsan]. Second aorist indicative. Clearly knew
   because he was not able to pronounce the benediction from the steps (Nu
   6:24-26). Continued making signs (en dianeuOn]. Periphrastic imperfect
   again. He nodded and beckoned back and forth [dia], between). Further
   proof of a vision that caused his dumbness.

   1:23 Ministration [leitourgias]. Our word liturgy. A common word in
   ancient Greek for public service, work for the people [leOs ergon]. It
   is common in the papyri for the service of the Egyptian priesthood as
   we see it in the LXX of Hebrew priests (see also Heb 8:6; 9:21; 2Co
   9:12; Php 2:17, 30).

   1:24 Conceived [sunelaben]. Luke uses this word eleven times and it
   occurs only five other times in the N.T. It is a very old and common
   Greek word. He alone in the N.T. has it for conceiving offspring (1:24,
   31, 36; 2:21) though Jas 1:15 uses it of lust producing sin. Hobart
   (Medical Language of Luke, p. 91) observes that Luke has almost as many
   words for pregnancy and barrenness as Hippocrates [en gastri echein],
   21:23; [egkuos], 2:5; [steira], 1:7; [ateknos], 20:28). Hid
   [periekruben]. Only here in the N.T., but in late Koine writers.
   Usually considered second aorist active indicative from [perikruptO],
   though it may be the imperfect indicative of a late form [perikrubO].
   If it is aorist it is the constative aorist. The preposition [peri]
   makes it mean completely (on all sides) hid.

   1:25 My reproach [oneidos mou]. Keenly felt by a Jewish wife because
   the husband wanted an heir and because of the hope of the Messiah, and
   because of the mother's longing for a child.

   1:26 Was sent [apestale]. Second aorist passive indicative of
   [apostellO] from which apostle comes. The angel Gabriel is God's
   messenger to Mary as to Zacharias (1:19).

   1:27 Betrothed [emnesteumenen]. Perfect passive participle. Betrothal
   usually lasted a year and unfaithfulness on the part of the bride was
   punished with death (De 23:24f.).

   1:28 Highly favoured [kecharitOmene]. Perfect passive participle of
   [charitoO] and means endowed with grace [charis], enriched with grace
   as in Eph 1:6, non ut mater gratiae, sed ut filia gratiae (Bengel). The
   Vulgate gratiae plena "is right, if it means full of grace which thou
   hast received'; wrong, if it means full of grace which thou hast to
   bestow"' (Plummer). The oldest MSS. do not have "Blessed art thou among
   women" here, but in verse 42.

   1:29 Cast in her mind [dielogizeto]. Imperfect indicative. Note aorist
   [dietarachthe]. Common verb for reckoning up different reasons. She was
   both upset and puzzled.

   1:30 Favour [charin]. Grace. Same root as [chairO] (rejoice) and
   [charitoO] in verse 28. To find favour is a common O.T. phrase.
   [Charis] is a very ancient and common word with a variety of applied
   meanings. They all come from the notion of sweetness, charm,
   loveliness, joy, delight, like words of grace, Lu 4:22, growing grace,
   Eph 4:29, with grace, Col 4:6. The notion of kindness is in it also,
   especially of God towards men as here. It is a favourite word for
   Christianity, the Gospel of the grace of God (Ac 20:24) in contrast
   with law or works (Joh 1:16). Gratitude is expressed also (Lu 6:32),
   especially to God (Ro 6:17). With God [para tOi theOi]. Beside God.

   1:31 Conceive in thy womb [sullempsei en gastri]. Adding [en gastri] to
   the verb of 1:24. Same idiom in Isa 7:14 of Immanuel. Jesus [Iesoun].
   As to Joseph in Mt 1:21, but without the explanation of the meaning.
   See on Matthew.

   1:32 The Son of the Most High [huios Hupsistou]. There is no article in
   the Greek, but the use of Most High in verse 35 clearly of God as here.
   In Lu 6:35 we find "sons of the Most High" [huioi Hupsistou] so that we
   cannot insist on deity here, though that is possible. The language of
   2Sa 7:14; Isa 9:7 is combined here.

   1:33 Shall be no end [ouk estai telos]. Luke reports the perpetuity of
   this Davidic kingdom over the house of Jacob with no Pauline
   interpretation of the spiritual Israel though that was the true meaning
   as Luke knew. Joseph was of the house of David (Lu 1:27) and Mary also
   apparently (Lu 2:5).

   1:35 Shall overshadow thee [episkiasei]. A figure of a cloud coming
   upon her. Common in ancient Greek in the sense of obscuring and with
   accusative as of Peter's shadow in Ac 5:15. But we have seen it used of
   the shining bright cloud at the Transfiguration of Jesus (Mt 17:5; Mr
   9:7; Lu 9:34). Here it is like the Shekinah glory which suggests it (Ex
   40:38) where the cloud of glory represents the presence and power of
   God. Holy, the Son of God [Hagion huios theou]. Here again the absence
   of the article makes it possible for it to mean "Son of God." See Mt
   5:9. But this title, like the Son of Man [Ho huios tou anthrOpou] was a
   recognized designation of the Messiah. Jesus did not often call himself
   Son of God (Mt 27:43), but it is assumed in his frequent use of the
   Father, the Son (Mt 11:27; Lu 10:21; Joh 5:19ff.). It is the title used
   by the Father at the baptism (Lu 3:22) and on the Mount of
   Transfiguration (Lu 9:35). The wonder of Mary would increase at these
   words. The Miraculous Conception or Virgin Birth of Jesus is thus
   plainly set forth in Luke as in Matthew. The fact that Luke was a
   physician gives added interest to his report.

   1:36 Kinswoman [suggenis]. Not necessarily cousin, but simply relative.

   1:37 No word [ouk rhema]. [Rhema] brings out the single item rather
   than the whole content [logos]. So in verse 38.

   1:39 Arose [anastasa]. Luke is very fond of this word, sixty times
   against twenty-two in the rest of the N.T. Into the hill country [eis
   ten orinen]. Luke uses this adjective twice in this context (here and
   1:65) instead of [to oros], the mountains. It is an old word and is in
   the LXX, but nowhere else in the N.T. The name of the city where
   Zacharias lived is not given unless Judah here means Juttah (Jos
   15:55). Hebron was the chief city of this part of Judea.

   1:40 Saluted [espasato]. Her first glance at Elisabeth showed the truth
   of the angel's message. The two mothers had a bond of sympathy.

   1:41 Leaped [eskirtesen]. A common enough incident with unborn children
   (Ge 25:22), but Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit to understand
   what had happened to Mary.

   1:42 With a loud cry [kraugei megalei]. A moment of ecstatic
   excitement. Blessed art thou [eulogemene]. Perfect passive participle.
   A Hebraistic equivalent for the superlative.

   1:43 The mother of my Lord [he meter tou Kuriou mou]. See Ps 110:1.
   Only by the help of the Holy Spirit could Elisabeth know that Mary was
   to be the mother of the Messiah.

   1:45 For [hoti]. It is not certain whether [hoti] here is "that" or
   "because." It makes good sense either way. See also 7:16. This is the
   first beatitude in the New Testament and it is similar to the last one
   in the Gospels spoken to Thomas to discourage his doubt (Joh 20:29).
   Elisabeth wishes Mary to have full faith in the prophecy of the angel.
   This song of Elisabeth is as real poetry as is that of Mary (1:47-55)
   and Zacharias (1:68-70). All three spoke under the power of the Holy
   Spirit. These are the first New Testament hymns and they are very
   beautiful. Plummer notes four strophes in Mary's Magnificat (46-48, 49,
   50, 51-53, 54, 55). Every idea here occurs in the Old Testament,
   showing that Mary's mind was full of the spiritual message of God's
   word.

   1:46 Doth magnify [megalunei]. Latin, magnificat.Harnack argues that
   this is also the song of Elisabeth because a few Latin MSS. have it so,
   but Mary is correct. She draws her material from the O.T. and sings in
   the noblest strain.

   1:47 Hath rejoiced [egalliasen]. This is aorist active indicative.
   Greek tenses do not correspond to those in English. The verb [agalliaO]
   is a Hellenistic word from the old Greek [agallO]. It means to exult.
   See the substantive [agalliasis] in Lu 1:14,44. Mary is not excited
   like Elisabeth, but breathes a spirit of composed rapture. My spirit
   [to pneuma mou]. One need not press unduly the difference between
   "soul" [psuche] in verse 46 and "spirit" here. Bruce calls them
   synonyms in parallel clauses. Vincent argues that the soul is the
   principle of individuality while the spirit is the point of contact
   between God and man. It is doubtful, however, if the trichotomous
   theory of man (body, soul, and spirit) is to be insisted on. It is
   certain that we have an inner spiritual nature for which various words
   are used in Mr 12:30). Even the distinction between intellect,
   emotions, and will is challenged by some psychologists. God my Saviour
   [tOi theOi tOi soteri mou]. Article with each substantive. God is
   called Saviour in the O.T. (De 32:15, Ps 24:5; 95:1).

   1:48 The low estate [ten tapeinOsin]. The bride of a carpenter and yet
   to be the mother of the Messiah. Literal sense here as in 1:52. Shall
   call me blessed [makariousin me]. So-called Attic future of an old
   verb, to felicitate. Elisabeth had already given her a beatitude
   [makaria], 1:45). Another occurs in 11:27. But this is a very different
   thing from the worship of Mary (Mariolatry) by Roman Catholics. See my
   The Mother of Jesus: Her Problems and Her Glory.

   1:50 Fear [phoboumenois]. Dative of the present middle participle. Here
   it is reverential fear as in Ac 10:2; Col 3:22. The bad sense of dread
   appears in Mt 21:46; Mr 6:20; Lu 12:4.

   1:51 Showed strength [epoiesen kratos]. "Made might" (Wycliff). A
   Hebrew conception as in Ps 118:15. Plummer notes six aorist indicatives
   in this sentence (51-63), neither corresponding to our English idiom,
   which translates here by "hath" each time. Imagination [dianoiai].
   Intellectual insight, moral understanding.

   1:52 Princes [dunastas]. Our word dynasty is from this word. It comes
   from [dunamai], to be able.

   1:54 Hath holpen [antelabeto]. Second aorist middle indicative. A very
   common verb. It means to lay hold of with a view to help or succour.
   Servant [paidos]. Here it means "servant," not "son" or "child," its
   usual meaning.

   1:58 Had magnified [emegalunen]. Aorist active indicative. Same verb as
   in verse 46. Rejoiced with her [sunechairon autei]. Imperfect tense and
   pictures the continual joy of the neighbours, accented also by [sun-]
   (cf. Php 2:18) in its mutual aspect.

   1:59 Would have called [ekaloun]. Conative imperfect, tried to call.

   1:62 Made signs [eneneuon]. Imperfect tense, repeated action as usual
   when making signs. In 1:22 the verb used of Zacharias is [dianeuOn].
   What he would have him called [to ti an theloi kaleisthai auto]. Note
   article [to] with the indirect question, accusative of general
   reference. The optative with [an] is here because it was used in the
   direct question (cf. Ac 17:18), and is simply retained in the indirect.
   What would he wish him to be called? (if he could speak), a conclusion
   of the fourth-class condition.

   1:63 Tablet [pinakidion]. Diminutive of [pinakis]. In Aristotle and the
   papyri for writing tablet, probably covered with wax. Sometimes it was
   a little table, like Shakespeare's "the table of my memory" (Hamlet,
   i.5). It was used also of a physician's note-book. Wrote, saying
   [egrapsen legOn]. Hebrew way of speaking (2Ki 10:6).

   1:64 Immediately [parachrema]. Nineteen times in the N.T., seventeen in
   Luke. Opened [aneOichthe]. First aorist passive indicative with double
   augment. The verb suits "mouth," but not "tongue" [glOssa]. It is thus
   a zeugma with tongue. Loosed or some such verb to be supplied.

   1:65 Fear [phobos]. Not terror, but religious awe because of contact
   with the supernatural as in the case of Zacharias (1:12). Were noised
   abroad [dielaleito]. Imperfect passive. Occurs in Polybius. In the N.T.
   only here and Lu 6:11. It was continuous talk back and forth between
   [dia] the people.

   1:66 What then [ti ara]. With all these supernatural happenings they
   predicted the marvellous career of this child. Note [Ti], what, not
   [Tis], who. Cf. Ac 12:18. They laid them up [ethento], second aorist
   middle indicative) as Mary did (2:19). The hand of the Lord [cheir
   Kuriou]. Luke's explanation in addition to the supernatural events. The
   expression occurs only in Luke's writing (Ac 11:21; 13:11).

   1:67 Prophesied [epropheteusen]. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
   This Benedictus [Eulogetos], Blessed) of Zacharias (68-79) may be what
   is referred to in verse 64 "he began to speak blessing God" [eulogOn].
   Nearly every phrase here is found in the O.T. (Psalms and Prophets).
   He, like Mary, was full of the Holy Spirit and had caught the Messianic
   message in its highest meaning.

   1:68 Hath visited [epeskepsato]. An old Greek word with a Hebraic
   colouring to look into with a view to help. The papyri have plenty of
   examples of the verb in the sense of inspecting, examining. Redemption
   [lutrOsin] here originally referred to political redemption, but with a
   moral and spiritual basis (verses 75, 77).

   1:69 Horn of salvation [keras sOterias]. A common metaphor in the O.T.
   (1Sa 2:10; 2Sa 23:3, etc.). It represents strength like the horns of
   bulls. Cf. Ps. 132:17.

   1:70 Since the world began [ap' aiOnos]. Better "from of old"
   (Weymouth, American Revision).

   1:73 The oath which he sware [horkon hon Omosen]. Antecedent attracted
   to case of the relative. The oath appears in Ge 22:16-18. The
   oppression of the Gentiles seems to be in the mind of Zacharias. It is
   not certain how clearly he grasped the idea of the spiritual Israel as
   Paul saw it in Galatians and Romans.

   1:74 Delivered [rhusthentas]. First aorist passive participle of an old
   verb, [rhuomai]. The accusative case appears, where the dative could
   have been used to agree with [hemin], because of the infinitive
   [latreuein] (verse 74) to serve (from latros, for hire). But Plato uses
   the word of service for God so that the bad sense does not always
   exist.

   1:75 In holiness and righteousness [en hosioteti kai dikaiosunei]. Not
   a usual combination (Eph 4:24; Tit 1:8; 1Th 2:10). The Godward and the
   manward aspects of conduct (Bruce). [Hosios], the eternal principles of
   right, [dikaios], the rule of conduct before men.

   1:76 Yea and thou [kai su de]. Direct address to the child with
   forecast of his life (cf. 1:13-17). Prophet [prophetes]. The word here
   directly applied to the child. Jesus will later call John a prophet and
   more than a prophet. The Lord [Kuriou]. Jehovah as in 1:16.

   1:77 Knowledge of salvation [gnOsin sOterias]. "This is the aim and end
   of the work of the Forerunner" (Plummer).

   1:78 Tender mercy [splagchna eleous]. Bowels of mercy literally (1Pe
   3:8; Jas 3:11). Revised margin has it, hearts of mercy. The dayspring
   from on high [anatole ex hupsous]. Literally, rising from on high, like
   the rising sun or stars (Isa 60:19). The word is used also of a
   sprouting plant or branch (Jer 23:5; Zec 6:12), but that does not suit
   here. Shall visit [epeskepsetai], correct text, cf. 1:68.

   1:79 To shine upon [epiphanai]. First aorist active infinitive of
   [epiphainO] (liquid verb). An old verb to give light, to shine upon,
   like the sun or stars. See also Ac 27:20; Tit 2:11; 3:4. The shadow of
   death [skiai thanatou]. See Ps 107:10, where darkness and shadow of
   death are combined as here. Cf. also Isa 9:1. See on Mt 4:16. To guide
   [tou kateuth-nai]. Genitive of the articular infinitive of purpose. The
   light will enable them in the dark to see how to walk in a straight
   path that leads to "the way of peace." We are still on that road, but
   so many stumble for lack of light, men and nations.

   1:80 Grew [euxane]. Imperfect active, was growing. Waxed strong
   [ekrataiouto]. Imperfect again. The child kept growing in strength of
   body and spirit. His shewing [anadeixeOs autou]. Here alone in the N.T.
   It occurs in Plutarch and Polybius. The verb appears in a sacrificial
   sense. The boy, as he grew, may have gone up to the passover and may
   have seen the boy Jesus (Lu 2:42-52), but he would not know that he was
   to be the Messiah. So these two boys of destiny grew on with the years,
   the one in the desert hills near Hebron after Zacharias and Elisabeth
   died, the other, the young Carpenter up in Nazareth, each waiting for
   "his shewing unto Israel."
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2

   2:1 Decree from Caesar Augustus [dogma para Kaisaros Augoustou]. Old
   and common word from [dokeO], to think, form an opinion. No such decree
   was given by Greek or Roman historians and it was for long assumed by
   many scholars that Luke was in error. But papyri and inscriptions have
   confirmed Luke on every point in these crucial verses 2:1-7. See W.M.
   Ramsay's books (Was Christ Born at Bethelehem? Luke the Physician. The
   Bearing of Recent Discovery on the Trustworthiness of the N.T.). The
   World [ten oikoumenen]. Literally, the inhabited (land, [gen].
   Inhabited by the Greeks, then by the Romans, then the whole world
   (Roman world, the world ruled by Rome). So Ac 11:28; 17:6. Should be
   enrolled [apographesthai]. It was a census, not a taxing, though taxing
   generally followed and was based on the census. This word is very old
   and common. It means to write or copy off for the public records, to
   register.

   2:2 The first enrolment [apographe prOte]. A definite allusion by Luke
   to a series of censuses instituted by Augustus, the second of which is
   mentioned by him in Ac 5:37. This second one is described by Josephus
   and it was supposed by some that Luke confused the two. But Ramsay has
   shown that a periodical fourteen-year census in Egypt is given in dated
   papyri back to A.D. 20. The one in Ac 5:37 would then be A.D. 6. This
   is in the time of Augustus. The first would then be B.C. 8 in Egypt. If
   it was delayed a couple of years in Palestine by Herod the Great for
   obvious reasons, that would make the birth of Christ about B.C. 6 which
   agrees with the other known data When Quirinius [Kureniou]. Genitive
   absolute. Here again Luke has been attacked on the ground that
   Quirinius was only governor of Syria once and that was A.D. 6 as shown
   by Josephus (Ant.XVIII. I.I). But Ramsay has proven by inscriptions
   that Quirinius was twice in Syria and that Luke is correct here also.
   See summary of the facts in my Luke the Historian in the Light of
   Research, pp. 118-29.

   2:3 Each to his own city [hekastos eis ten heautou polin]. A number of
   papyri in Egypt have the heading enrolment by household [apographe kat'
   oikian]. Here again Luke is vindicated. Each man went to the town where
   his family register was kept.

   2:5 To enrol himself with Mary [apograpsasthai sun Mariam]. Direct
   middle. "With Mary" is naturally taken with the infinitive as here. If
   so, that means that Mary's family register was in Bethlehem also and
   that she also belonged to the house of David. It is possible to connect
   "with Mary" far back with "went up" [anebe] in verse 4, but it is
   unnatural to do so. There is no real reason for doubting that Mary
   herself was a descendant of David and that is the obvious way to
   understand Luke's genealogy of Jesus in Lu 3:23-38). The Syriac
   Sinaitic expressly says that both Joseph and Mary were of the house and
   city of David. Betrothed [emnesteumenen]. Same verb as in 1:27, but
   here it really means "married" or "espoused" as Mt 1:24f. shows.
   Otherwise she could not have travelled with Joseph. Great with child
   [enkuOi]. Only here in N.T. Common Greek word.

   2:6 That she should be delivered [tou tekein auten]. For the bearing
   the child as to her. A neat use of the articular infinitive, second
   aorist active, with the accusative of general reference. From [tiktO],
   common verb.

   2:7 Her firstborn [ton prOtotokon]. The expression naturally means that
   she afterwards had other children and we read of brothers and sisters
   of Jesus. There is not a particle of evidence for the notion that Mary
   refused to bear other children because she was the mother of the
   Messiah. Wrapped in swaddling clothes [esparganOsen]. From [sparganon],
   a swathing band. Only here and verse 12 in the N.T., but in Euripides,
   Aristotle, Hippocrates, Plutarch. Frequent in medical works. In a
   manger [en phatnei]. In a crib in a stall whether in a cave (Justin
   Martyr) or connected with the inn we do not know. The cattle may have
   been out on the hills or the donkeys used in travelling may have been
   feeding in this stall or another near. In the inn [en tOi katalumati].
   A lodging-house or khan, poor enough at best, but there was not even
   room in this public place because of the crowds for the census. See the
   word also in Lu 22:11; Mr 14:14 with the sense of guest-room (cf. 1Ki
   1:13). It is the Hellenistic equivalent for [katagOgeion] and appears
   also in one papyrus. See Ex 4:24. There would sometimes be an inner
   court, a range or arches, an open gallery round the four sides. On one
   side of the square, outside the wall, would be stables for the asses
   and camels, buffaloes and goats. Each man had to carry his own food and
   bedding.

   2:8 Abiding in the field [agraulountes]. From [agros], field and
   [aule], court. The shepherds were making the field their court.
   Plutarch and Strabo use the word. Keeping watch [phulassontes
   phulakas]. Cognate accusative. They were bivouacking by night and it
   was plainly mild weather. In these very pastures David had fought the
   lion and the bear to protect the sheep (1Sa 17:34f.). The plural here
   probably means that they watched by turns. The flock may have been
   meant for the temple sacrifices. There is no way to tell.

   2:9 Stood by them [epeste autois]. Ingressive aorist active indicative.
   Stepped by their side. The same word in Ac 12:7 of the angel there.
   Paul uses it in the sense of standing by in Ac 22:20). It is a common
   old Greek word, [ephistemi]. Were sore afraid [ephobethesan phobon
   megan]. First aorist passive indicative with cognate accusative (the
   passive sense gone), they feared a great fear.

   2:10 I bring you good tidings of great joy [euaggelizomai h-min charan
   megalen]. Wycliff, "I evangelize to you a great joy." The active verb
   [euaggelizO] occurs only in late Greek writers, LXX, a few papyri
   examples, and the N.T. The middle (deponent) appears from Aristophanes
   on. Luke and Paul employ both substantive [euaggelion] and verb
   [euaggelizO] very frequently. It is to Paul's influence that we owe
   their frequency and popularity in the language of Christendom (George
   Milligan, The Epistles to the Thessalonians, p. 143). The other Gospels
   do not have the verb save Mt 11:5 and that in a quotation (Isa 61:1).

   2:11 [Is born] [etechthe]. First aorist passive indicative from
   [tiktO]. Was born. Saviour [sOter]. This great word is common in Luke
   and Paul and seldom elsewhere in the N.T. (Bruce). The people under
   Rome's rule came to call the emperor "Saviour" and Christians took the
   word and used it of Christ. See inscriptions (Deissmann, Light from the
   Ancient East, p. 344). Christ the Lord [Christos Kurios]. This
   combination occurs nowhere else in the N.T. and it is not clear what it
   really means. Luke is very fond of [Kurios] (Lord) where the other
   Gospels have Jesus. It may mean "Christ the Lord," "Anointed Lord,"
   "Messiah, Lord," "The Messiah, the Lord," "An Anointed One, a Lord," or
   "Lord Messiah." It occurs once in the LXX (La 4:20) and is in Ps. of
   Sol. 17:36. Ragg suggests that our phrase "the Lord Jesus Christ" is
   really involved in "A Saviour (Jesus) which is Christ the Lord." See on
   Mt 1:1 for Christ and Mt 21:3 for Lord.

   2:13 Host [stratias]. A military term for a band of soldiers common in
   the ancient Greek. Bengel says: "Here the army announces peace."
   Praising [ainountOn]. Construction according to sense (plural, though
   [stratias] is singular).

   2:14 Among men in whom he is well pleased [en anthrOpois eudokias]. The
   Textus Receptus (Authorized Version also has [eudokia], but the
   genitive [eudokias] is undoubtedly correct, supported by the oldest and
   best uncials.) (Aleph, A B D W). C has a lacuna here. Plummer justly
   notes how in this angelic hymn Glory and Peace correspond, in the
   highest and on earth, to God and among men of goodwill. It would be
   possible to connect "on earth" with "the highest" and also to have a
   triple division. There has been much objection raised to the genitive
   [eudokias], the correct text. But it makes perfectly good sense and
   better sense. As a matter of fact real peace on earth exists only among
   those who are the subjects of God's goodwill, who are characterized by
   goodwill toward God and man. This word [eudokia] we have already had in
   Mt 11:26. It does not occur in the ancient Greek. The word is confined
   to Jewish and Christian writings, though the papyri furnish instances
   of [eudokesis]. Wycliff has it "to men of goodwill."

   2:15 Said to one another [elaloun pros allelous]. Imperfect tense,
   inchoative, "began to speak," each to the other. It suggests also
   repetition, they kept saying, Now [de]. A particle of urgency. This
   thing [to rhema touto]. A Hebraistic and vernacular use of [rhema]
   (something said) as something done. See on Lu 1:65. The ancient Greek
   used [logos] in this same way.

   2:16 With haste [speusantes]. Aorist active participle of simultaneous
   action. Found [aneuran]. Second aorist active indicative of a common
   Greek verb [aneuriskO], but only in Luke in the N.T. The compound [ana]
   suggests a search before finding.

   2:17 Made known [egnOrisan]. To others (verse 18) besides Joseph and
   Mary. The verb is common from Aeschylus on, from the root of [ginOskO]
   (to know). It is both transitive and intransitive in the N.T.

   2:19 Kept [suneterei]. Imperfect active. She kept on keeping together
   [sun-] all these things. They were meat and drink to her. She was not
   astonished, but filled with holy awe. The verb occurs from Aristotle
   on. She could not forget. But did not Mary keep also a Baby Book? And
   may not Luke have seen it? Pondering [sunballousa]. An old Greek word.
   Placing together for comparison. Mary would go over each detail in the
   words of Gabriel and of the shepherds and compare the sayings with the
   facts so far developed and brood over it all with a mother's high hopes
   and joy.

   2:21 His name was called Jesus [kai eklethe to onoma autou Iesous]. The
   [kai] is left untranslated or has the sense of "then" in the apodosis.
   The naming was a part of the ceremony of circumcision as is shown also
   in the case of John the Baptist (Lu 1:59-66).

   2:22 The days of their purification [hai hemerai tou katharismou
   autOn]. The old manuscripts have "their" [autOn] instead of "her"
   [autes] of the later documents. But it is not clear whether "their"
   refers to Mary and Joseph as is true of "they brought" or to Mary and
   the child. The mother was Levitically unclean for forty days after the
   birth of a son (Le 12:1-8). To present him to the Lord [parastesai tOi
   KuriOi]. Every first-born son was thus redeemed by the sacrifice (Ex
   13:2-12) as a memorial of the sparing of the Israelitish families (Nu
   18:15f.). The cost was about two dollars and a half in our money.

   2:23 In the law of the Lord [en nomOi Kuriou]. No articles, but
   definite by preposition and genitive. Vincent notes that "law" occurs
   in this chapter five times. Paul (Gal 4:4) will urge that Jesus "was
   made under the law" as Luke here explains. The law did not require that
   the child be brought to Jerusalem. The purification concerned the
   mother, the presentation the son.

   2:24 A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons [Zeugos trugonOn e duo
   nossous peristerOn]. The offspring of the poor, costing about sixteen
   cents, while a lamb would cost nearly two dollars. The "young of
   pigeons" is the literal meaning.

   2:25 Devout [eulabes]. Used only by Luke (Ac 2:5; 8:2; 22:12) in the
   N.T. Common in ancient Greek from Plato on. It means taking hold well
   or carefully [eu] and [labein] and so reverently, circumspectly.
   Looking for the consolation of Israel [prosdechomenos paraklesin tou
   Israel]. Old Greek verb to admit to one's presence (Lu 15:2) and then
   to expect as here and of Anna in verse 38. Paraklesin here means the
   Messianic hope (Isa 11:10; 40:1), calling to one's side for cheer. Upon
   him [ep' auton]. This is the explanation of his lively Messianic hope.
   It was due to the Holy Spirit. Simeon and Anna are representatives of
   real piety in this time of spiritual dearth and deadness.

   2:26 It had been revealed unto him [en autOi kechrematismenon].
   Periphrastic past perfect passive indicative. Common Greek verb. First
   to transact business from [chrema] and that from [chraomai], to use,
   make use of; then to do business with public officials, to give advice
   (judges, rulers, kings), then to get the advice of the Delphic and
   other oracles (Diodorus, Plutarch). The LXX and Josephus use it of
   God's commands. A Fayum papyrus of 257 B.C. has the substantive
   [chremastismos] for a divine response (cf. Ro 11:4). See Deissmann,
   Light From the Ancient East, p. 153. Before [prin e]. Classic Greek
   idiom after a negative to have subjunctive as here (only example in the
   N.T.) or the optative after past tense as in Ac 25:16 (subjunctive
   changed to optative in indirect discourse). Elsewhere in the N.T. the
   infinitive follows [prin] as in Mt 1:18.

   2:27 When the parents brought in the child Jesus [en tOi eisagagein
   tous goneis to paidion Iesoun]. A neat Greek and Hebrew idiom difficult
   to render into English, very common in the LXX; In the bringing the
   Child Jesus as to the parents. The articular infinitive and two
   accusatives (one the object, the other accusative of general
   reference). After the custom of the law [kata to eithismenon tou
   nomou]. Here the perfect passive participle [eithismenon], neuter
   singular from [ethizO] (common Greek verb, to accustom) is used as a
   virtual substantive like [to ethos] in 1:8. Luke alone in the N.T. uses
   either word save [ethos] in Joh 19:40, though [eiOtha] from [ethO],
   occurs also in Mt 27:15; Mr 10:1.

   2:28 Then he [kai autos]. [Kai] as in 2:21. [Autos], emphatic subject,
   he after the parents. Arms [agkalas]. Old Greek word, here only in the
   N.T. It means the curve or inner angle of the arm.

   2:29 Now lettest thou [nun apolueis]. Present active indicative, Thou
   art letting. The Nunc Dimittis, adoration and praise. It is full of
   rapture and vivid intensity (Plummer) like the best of the Psalms. The
   verb [apoluO] was common for the manumission of slaves and Simeon here
   calls himself "thy slave [doulon sou], Lord [Despota], our despot)."
   See 2Pe 2:1.

   2:31 Of all the peoples [pantOn tOn laOn]. Not merely Jews. Another
   illustration of the universality of Luke's Gospel seen already in 1:70
   in the hymn of Zacharias. The second strophe of the song according to
   Plummer showing what the Messiah will be to the world after having
   shown what the Messiah is to Simeon.

   2:32 Revelation to the Gentiles [apokalupsin ethnOn]. Objective
   genitive. The Messiah is to be light [phOs] for the Gentiles in
   darkness (1:70) and glory [doxa] for Israel (cf. Ro 9:1-5; Isa 49:6).
   The word [ethnos] originally meant just a crowd or company, then a race
   or nation, then the nations other than Israel (the people, [ho laos] or
   the people of God. The word Gentile is Latin from gens, a tribe or
   nation. But the world-wide mission of the Messiah comes out clearly in
   these early chapters in Luke.

   2:33 His father and his mother [ho pater autou kai he meter]. Luke had
   already used "parents" in 2:27. He by no means intends to deny the
   Virgin Birth of Jesus so plainly stated in 1:34-38. He merely employs
   here the language of ordinary custom. The late MSS. wrongly read "and
   Joseph" instead of "his father." Were marvelling [en thaumazontes]. The
   masculine gender includes the feminine when both are referred to. But
   [en] is singular, not [esan], the normal imperfect plural in this
   periphrastic imperfect. This is due to the wide space between copula
   and participle. The copula [en] agrees in number with [ho pater] while
   the participle coming last agrees with both [ho pater kai he meter]
   (cf. Mt 17:3; 22:40). If one wonders why they marvelled at Simeon's
   words after what they had heard from Gabriel, Elisabeth, and the
   Shepherds, he should bear in mind that every parent is astonished and
   pleased at the fine things others see in the child. It is a mark of
   unusual insight for others to see so much that is obvious to the
   parent. Simeon's prophecy had gone beyond the angel's outline and it
   was surprising that he should know anything about the child's destiny.

   2:34 Is set for the falling and the rising up of many in Israel [Keitai
   eis ptOsin kai anastasin pollOn en tOi Israel]. Present indicative of
   the old defective verb appearing only in present and imperfect in the
   N.T. Sometimes it is used as the passive of [tithemi] as here. The
   falling of some and the rising up of others is what is meant. He will
   be a stumbling-block to some (Isa 8:14; Mt 21:42,44; Ro 9:33; 1Pe
   2:16f.) who love darkness rather than light (Joh 3:19), he will be the
   cause of rising for others (Ro 6:4,9; Eph 2:6). "Judas despairs, Peter
   repents: one robber blasphemes, the other confesses" (Plummer). Jesus
   is the magnet of the ages. He draws some, he repels others. This is
   true of all epoch-making men to some extent. Spoken against
   [antilegomenon]. Present passive participle, continuous action. It is
   going on today. Nietzsche regarded Jesus Christ as the curse of the
   race because he spared the weak.

   2:35 A sword [rhomphaia]. A large sword, properly a long Thracian
   javelin. It occurs in the LXX of Goliath's sword (1Sa 17:51). How
   little Mary understood the meaning of Simeon's words that seemed so out
   of place in the midst of the glorious things already spoken, a sharp
   thorn in their roses, a veritable bitter-sweet. But one day Mary will
   stand by the Cross of Christ with this Thracian javelin clean through
   her soul, [stabat Mater Dolorosa] (Joh 19:25). It is only a parenthesis
   here, and a passing cloud perhaps passed over Mary's heart already
   puzzled with rapture and ecstasy. May be revealed [apokaluphthOsin].
   Unveiled. First aorist passive subjunctive after [hopOs an] and
   expresses God's purpose in the mission of the Messiah. He is to test
   men's thoughts [dialogismoi] and purposes. They will be compelled to
   take a stand for Christ or against him. That is true today.

   2:36 One Anna a prophetess [Hanna prophetis]. The word [prophetis]
   occurs in the N.T. only here and Re 2:20). In old Greek writers it
   means a woman who interprets oracles. The long parenthesis into verse
   37 tells of her great age. Montefiore makes it 106 as she was 15 when
   married, married 7 years, a widow 84.

   2:37 Which departed not [he ouk aphistato]. Imperfect indicative
   middle. She kept on not leaving. The Spirit kept her in the temple as
   he led Simon to the temple (Plummer). The case of "the temple" [tou
   hierou] is ablative. Night and day [nukta kai hemeran]. Accusative of
   duration of time, all night and all day. She never missed a service in
   the temple.

   2:38 Coming up [epistasa]. Second aorist active participle. The word
   often has the notion of coming suddenly or bursting in as of Martha in
   Lu 10:40). But here it probably means coming up and standing by and so
   hearing Simeon's wonderful words so that her words form a kind of
   footnote to his. Gave thanks [anthOmologeito]. Imperfect middle of a
   verb [anthomologeO] in common use in Greek writers and in the LXX
   though here alone in the N.T. It had the idea of a mutual agreement or
   of saying something before one [anti]. Anna was evidently deeply moved
   and repeated her thanksgiving and kept speaking [elalei], imperfect
   again) "to all them that were looking for [prosdechomenois], as in 1:35
   of Simeon) the redemption of Jerusalem [lutrOsin Ierousalem]. " There
   was evidently a group of such spirits that gathered in the temple
   either men around her and Simeon or whom she met from time to time.
   There was thus a nucleus of old saints in Jerusalem prepared for the
   coming of the Messiah when he at last appears as the Messiah in
   Jerusalem (John 2 and 3). These probably all passed away. But they had
   a happy hour of hope and joy. The late MSS. have "in Jerusalem" but "of
   Jerusalem" is correct. What they meant by the "redemption of Jerusalem"
   is not clear, whether political or spiritual or both. Simeon was
   looking for the consolation of Israel (2:25) and Zacharias (1:68) sang
   of redemption for Israel (Isa 40:2).

   2:39 To their own city Nazareth [eis polin heautOn Nazaret]. See on Mt
   2:23 about Nazareth. Luke tells nothing of the flight to Egypt and the
   reason for the return to Nazareth instead of Bethlehem, the place of
   the birth of Jesus as told in Mt 2:13-23. But then neither Gospel gives
   all the details of this period. Luke has also nothing about the visit
   of the wise men (Mt 2:1-12) as Matthew tells nothing of the shepherds
   and of Simeon and Anna (Lu 2:8-28). The two Gospels supplement each
   other.

   2:40 The child grew [euxane]. Imperfect indicative of a very ancient
   verb [auxanO]. This child grew and waxed strong [ekrataiouto],
   imperfect middle), a hearty vigorous little boy [paidion]. Both verbs
   Luke used in 1:80 of the growth of John the Baptist as a child. Then he
   used also [pneumati], in spirit. Here in addition to the bodily
   development Luke has "filled with wisdom" [pleroumenon sophiai].
   Present passive participle, showing that the process of filling with
   wisdom kept pace with the bodily growth. If it were only always true
   with others! We need not be troubled over this growth in wisdom on the
   part of Jesus any more than over his bodily growth. "The intellectual,
   moral, and spiritual growth of the Child, like the physical, was real.
   His was a perfect humanity developing perfectly, unimpeded by
   hereditary or acquired defects. It was the first instance of such a
   growth in history. For the first time a human infant was realizing the
   ideal of humanity" (Plummer). The grace of God [charis theou]. In full
   measure.

   2:41 Every year [kat' etos]. This idiom only here in the N.T., a common
   Greek construction. Every male was originally expected to appear at the
   passover, pentecost, and tabernacles (Ex 23:14-17; 34:23; De 16:16).
   But the Dispersion rendered that impossible. But pious Palestinian Jews
   made a point of going at least to the passover. Mary went with Joseph
   as a pious habit, though not required by law to go.

   2:42 Twelve years old [etOn dOdeka]. Predicate genitive. Luke does not
   say that Jesus had not been to Jerusalem before, but at twelve a Jewish
   boy became a "son of the law" and began to observe the ordinances,
   putting on the phylacteries as a reminder. They went up [anabainontOn
   autOn]. Genitive absolute with present active participle, a loose
   construction here, for the incident narrated took place after they had
   gone up, not while they were gong up. "On their usual going up"
   (Plummer).

   2:43 When they had fulfilled the days [teleiOsantOn tas hemeras].
   Genitive absolute again, but aorist participle (effective aorist). "The
   days" may mean the full seven days (Ex 12:15f.; Le 23:6-8; De 16:3), or
   the two chief days after which many pilgrims left for home. As they
   were returning [en tOi hupostrephein antous]. The articular infinitive
   with [en], a construction that Luke often uses (1:21; 2:27). The boy,
   Jesus [Iesous ho pais]. More exactly, "Jesus the boy." In verse 40 it
   was "the child " [to paidion], here it is "the boy" [ho pais], no
   longer the diminutive form). It was not disobedience on the part of
   "the boy" that made him remain behind, but intense interest in the
   services of the temple; "involuntary preoccupation" (Bruce) held him
   fast.

   2:44 In the company [en tei sunodiai]. The caravan going together on
   the road or way [sun, hodos], a journey in company, then by metonymy
   the company itself. A common Greek word (Plutarch, Strabo, etc.). The
   women usually went ahead and the men followed. Joseph may have thought
   Jesus was with Mary and Mary that he was with Joseph. "The Nazareth
   caravan was so long that it took a whole day to look through it"
   (Plummer). They sought for him [anezetoun auton]. Imperfect active.
   Common Greek verb. Note force of [ana]. They searched up and down, back
   and forth, a thorough search and prolonged, but in vain.

   2:45 Seeking for him [anazetountes auton]. Present participle of the
   same verb. This was all that was worth while now, finding the lost boy.

   2:46 After three days [meta hemeras treis]. One day out, one day back,
   and on the third day finding him. In the temple [en tOi hierOi].
   Probably on the terrace where members of the Sanhedrin gave public
   instruction on sabbaths and feast-days, so probably while the feast was
   still going on. The rabbis probably sat on benches in a circle. The
   listeners on the ground, among whom was Jesus the boy in a rapture of
   interest. Both hearing them and asking them questions [kai akouonta
   autOn kai eperOtOnta autous]. Paul sat at the feet of Gamaliel (Ac
   22:3). Picture this eager boy alive with interest. It was his one
   opportunity in a theological school outside of the synagogue to hear
   the great rabbis expound the problems of life. This was the most
   unusual of all children, to be sure, in intellectual grasp and power.
   But it is a mistake to think that children of twelve do not think
   profoundly concerning the issues of life. What father or mother has
   ever been able to answer a child's questions?

   2:47 Were amazed [existanto]. Imperfect indicative middle, descriptive
   of their continued and repeated astonishment. Common verb [existemi]
   meaning that they stood out of themselves as if their eyes were bulging
   out. The boy had a holy thirst for knowledge (Plummer), and he used a
   boy's way of learning. At his understanding [epi tei sunesei]. Based on
   [epi], the grasp and comprehension from [suniemi], comparing and
   combining things. Cf. Mr 12:33. His answers [tais apokrisesin autou].
   It is not difficult to ask hard questions, but this boy had astounding
   answers to their questions, revealing his amazing intellectual and
   spiritual growth.

   2:48 They were astonished [exeplagesan]. Second aorist passive
   indicative of an old Greek word [ekplessO], to strike out, drive out by
   a blow. Joseph and Mary "were struck out" by what they saw and heard.
   Even they had not fully realized the power in this wonderful boy.
   Parents often fail to perceive the wealth of nature in their children.

   2:49 Son [teknon]. Child, literally. It was natural for Mary to be the
   first to speak. Why [Ti]. The mother's reproach of the boy is followed
   by a confession of negligence on her part and of Joseph (sorrowing,
   [odunOmenoi]. Thy father [ho pater sou]. No contradiction in this.
   Alford says: "Up to this time Joseph had been so called by the holy
   child himself, but from this time never." Sought [ezetoumen]. Imperfect
   tense describing the long drawn out search for three days. How is it
   that [Ti hoti]. The first words of Jesus preserved to us. This crisp
   Greek idiom without copula expresses the boy's amazement that his
   parents should not know that there was only one possible place in
   Jerusalem for him. I must be [dei einai me]. Messianic consciousness of
   the necessity laid on him. Jesus often uses [dei] (must) about his
   work. Of all the golden dreams of any boy of twelve here is the
   greatest. In my Father's house [en tois tou patros mou]. Not "about my
   Father's business," but "in my Father's house" (cf. Ge 41:51). Common
   Greek idiom. And note "my," not "our." When the boy first became
   conscious of his peculiar relation to the Father in heaven we do not
   know. But he has it now at twelve and it will grow within him through
   the years ahead in Nazareth.

   2:50 They understood not [ou sunekan]. First aorist active indicative
   (one of the k aorists). Even Mary with all her previous preparation and
   brooding was not equal to the dawning of the Messianic consciousness in
   her boy. "My Father is God," Jesus had virtually said, "and I must be
   in His house." Bruce observes that a new era has come when Jesus calls
   God "Father," not [Despotes]. "Even we do not yet fully understand"
   (Bruce) what Jesus the boy here said.

   2:51 He was subject unto them [en hupotassomenos autois]. Periphrastic
   imperfect passive. He continued subject unto them, this wondrous boy
   who really knew more than parents and rabbis, this gentle, obedient,
   affectionate boy. The next eighteen years at Nazareth (Lu 3:23) he
   remained growing into manhood and becoming the carpenter of Nazareth
   (Mr 6:3) in succession to Joseph (Mt 13:55) who is mentioned here for
   the last time. Who can tell the wistful days when Jesus waited at
   Nazareth for the Father to call him to his Messianic task? Kept
   [dieterei]. Imperfect active. Ancient Greek word [diatereO], but only
   here and Ac 15:29 in the N.T. though in Ge 37:11. She kept thoroughly
   [dia] all these recent sayings (or things, [rhemata]. In 2:19
   [suneterei] is the word used of Mary after the shepherds left. These
   she kept pondering and comparing all the things. Surely she has a full
   heart now. Could she foresee how destiny would take Jesus out beyond
   her mother's reach?

   2:52 Advanced in wisdom and stature [proekopten tei sophiai kai
   helikiai]. Imperfect active, he kept cutting his way forward as through
   a forest or jungle as pioneers did. He kept growing in stature
   [helikia] may mean age, as in 12:25, but stature here) and in wisdom
   (more than mere knowledge). His physical, intellectual, moral,
   spiritual development was perfect. "At each stage he was perfect for
   that stage" (Plummer). In favour [chariti]. Or grace. This is ideal
   manhood to have the favour of God and men.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3

   3:1 Now in the fifteenth year [en etei de pentekaidekatOi]. Tiberius
   Caesar was ruler in the provinces two years before Augustus Caesar
   died. Luke makes a six-fold attempt here to indicate the time when John
   the Baptist began his ministry. John revived the function of the
   prophet [Ecce Homo], p. 2) and it was a momentous event after centuries
   of prophetic silence. Luke begins with the Roman Emperor, then mentions
   Pontius Pilate Procurator of Judea, Herod Antipas Tetrarch of Galilee
   (and Perea), Philip, Tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis, Lysanias,
   Tetrarch of Abilene (all with the genitive absolute construction) and
   concludes with the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas (son-in-law
   and successor of Annas). The ancients did not have our modern system of
   chronology, the names of rulers as here being the common way. Objection
   has been made to the mention of Lysanias here because Josephus
   (Ant.XXVII. I) tells of a Lysanias who was King of Abila up to B.C. 36
   as the one referred to by Luke with the wrong date. But an inscription
   has been found on the site of Abilene with mention of "Lysanias the
   tetrarch" and at the time to which Luke refers (see my Luke the
   Historian in the Light of Research, pp. 167f.). So Luke is vindicated
   again by the rocks.

   3:2 The Word of God came unto John [egeneto rhema theou epi IOanen].
   The great epoch marked by [egeneto] rather than [en]. [Rhema theou] is
   some particular utterance of God (Plummer), common in LXX, here alone
   in the N.T. Then John is introduced as the son of Zacharias according
   to Chapter 1. Matthew describes him as the Baptist, Mark as the
   Baptizer. No other Gospel mentions Zacharias. Mark begins his Gospel
   here, but Matthew and Luke have two Infancy Chapters before. Luke alone
   tells of the coming of the word to John. All three Synoptics locate him
   "in the wilderness" [en tei eremOi] as here, Mr 1:4; Mt 3:1 (adding "of
   Judea").

   3:3 All the region round about Jordan [pasan perichOron tou Iordanou].
   The wilderness was John's abode (1:80) so that he began preaching where
   he was. It was the plain (Ge 13:10f.) or valley of the Jordan, El Ghor,
   as far north as Succoth (2Ch 4:17). Sometimes he was on the eastern
   bank of the Jordan (Joh 10:40), though usually on the west side. His
   baptizing kept him near the river. The baptism of repentance unto
   remission of sins [baptisma metanoias eis aphesin hamartiOn]. The same
   phrase as in Mr 1:4, which see for discussion of these important words.
   The word remission [aphesis] "occurs in Luke more frequently than in
   all the other New Testament writers combined" (Vincent). In medical
   writers it is used for the relaxing of disease.

   3:4 As it is written [hOs gegraptai]. The regular formula for
   quotation, perfect passive indicative of [graphO]. Isaiah the prophet
   [Esaiou tou prophetou]. The same phrase in Mr 1:2 (correct text) and Mt
   3:3. Mark, as we have seen, adds a quotation from Mal 3:1 and Luke
   gives verses 4 and 5 of Isa. 40 not in Matthew or Mark (Lu 3:5,6). See
   Mt 3:3; Mr 1:3 for discussion of Luke 4:4.

   3:5 Valley [pharagx]. Here only in the N.T., though in the LXX and
   ancient Greek. It is a ravine or valley hedged in by precipices. Shall
   be filled [plerOthesetai]. Future passive indicative of [pleroO]. In
   1845 when the Sultan visited Brusa the inhabitants were called out to
   clear the roads of rocks and to fill up the hollows. Oriental monarchs
   often did this very thing. A royal courier would go ahead to issue the
   call. So the Messiah sends his herald (John) before him to prepare the
   way for him. Isaiah described the preparation for the Lord's triumphal
   march and John used it with great force. Hill [bounos]. Called a
   Cyrenaic word by Herodotus, but later Greek writers use it as does the
   LXX. Brought low [tapeinOthesetai]. Future passive indicative of
   [tapeinoO]. Literal meaning here of a verb common in the metaphorical
   sense. Crooked [skolia]. Common word, curved, opposite of [orthos] or
   [euthus], straight.

   3:6 All flesh [pasa sarx]. Used in the N.T. of the human race alone,
   though in the LXX brutes are included. The salvation of God [to
   soterion tou theou]. The saving act of God. This phrase aptly describes
   Luke's Gospel which has in mind the message of Christ for all men. It
   is the universal Gospel.

   3:7 To the multitude that went out [tois exporeuomenois ochlois].
   Plural, Multitudes. The present participle also notes the repetition of
   the crowds as does [elegen] (imperfect), he used to say. Mt 3:7-10
   singles out the message of John to the Pharisees and Sadducees, which
   see for discussion of details. Luke gives a summary of his preaching to
   the crowds with special replies to these inquiries: the multitudes, 10,
   11, the publicans 12,13, the soldiers 14. To be baptized of him
   [baptisthenai hup' autou]. This is the purpose of their coming. Mt 3:7
   has simply "to his baptism." John's metaphors are from the wilderness
   (vipers, fruits, axe, slave boy loosing sandals, fire, fan,
   thrashing-floor, garner, chaff, stones). Who warned you? [tis
   hepedeixen humin;]. The verb is like our "suggest" by proof to eye,
   ear, or brain (Lu 6:47; 12:5; Ac 9:16; 20:35; Mt 3:7). Nowhere else in
   the N.T. though common ancient word [hupodeiknumi], show under, point
   out, give a tip or private hint).

   3:10 Asked [eperOtOn]. Imperfect tense, repeatedly asked. What then
   must we do? [ti oun poiesOmen;]. Deliberative aorist subjunctive. More
   exactly, What then are we to do, What then shall we do? Same
   construction in verses 12, 14. The [oun] refers to the severe things
   already said by John (Lu 3:7-9).

   3:11 Coats [chitOnas]. The inner and less necessary undergarment. The
   outer indispensable [himation] is not mentioned. Note the specific and
   different message to each class. John puts his finger on the weaknesses
   of the people right before him.

   3:12 Also publicans [kai telOnai]. We have had the word already in
   Matthew (Mt 5:46; 9:10; 11:19; 18:17; 21:31f.) and Mark (Mr 11:15f.).
   It is sometimes coupled with harlots and other sinners, the outcasts of
   society. The word is made up from [telos], tax, and [Oneomai], to buy,
   and is an old one. The renter or collector of taxes was not popular
   anywhere, but least of all when a Jew collected taxes for the Romans
   and did it by terrible graft and extortions. Extort [prassete]. The
   verb means only to do or practice, but early the tax-collectors learned
   how to "do" the public as regular "blood-suckers." Lucian links them
   with crows and sycophants.

   3:14 Soldiers also [kai strateuomenoi]. Men on service, militantes
   rather than milites (Plummer). So Paul in 2Ti 2:4. An old word like
   [stratiOtes], soldier. Some of these soldiers acted as police to help
   the publicans. But they were often rough and cruel. Do violence to no
   man [medena diaseisete]. Here only in the N.T., but in the LXX and
   common in ancient Greek. It means to shake (seismic disturbance,
   earthquake) thoroughly [dia] and so thoroughly to terrify, to extort
   money or property by intimidating (3Macc. 7:21). The Latin employs
   concutere, so. It was a process of blackmail to which Socrates refers
   (Xenophon, Memorabilia, ii. 9,1). This was a constant temptation to
   soldiers. Might does not make right with Jesus. Neither exact anything
   wrongfully [mede sukophantesete]. In Athens those whose business it was
   to inform against any one whom they might find exporting figs out of
   Attica were called fig-showers or sycophants [sukophantai]. From
   [sukon], fig, and [phainO], show. Some modern scholars reject this
   explanation since no actual examples of the word meaning merely a
   fig-shower have been found. But without this view it is all
   conjectural. From the time of Aristophanes on it was used for any
   malignant informer or calumniator. These soldiers were tempted to
   obtain money by informing against the rich, blackmail again. So the
   word comes to mean to accuse falsely. The sycophants came to be a
   regular class of informers or slanderers in Athens. Socrates is quoted
   by Xenophon as actually advising Crito to employ one in self-defence,
   like the modern way of using one gunman against another. Demosthenes
   pictures a sycophant as one who "glides about the market like a
   scorpion, with his venomous sting all ready, spying out whom he may
   surprise with misfortune and ruin and from whom he can most easily
   extort money, by threatening him with an action dangerous in its
   consequences" (quoted by Vincent). The word occurs only in Luke in the
   N.T., here and in Lu 19:8 in the confession of Zaccheus. It occurs in
   the LXX and often in the old Greek. Be content with your wages
   [arkeisthe tois opsOniois humOn]. Discontent with wages was a complaint
   of mercenary soldiers. This word for wages was originally anything
   cooked [opson], cooked food), and bought (from [Oneomai], to buy).
   Hence, "rations," "pay," wages. [Opsarion], diminutive of [opson], was
   anything eaten with bread like broiled fish. So [opsOnion] comes to
   mean whatever is bought to be eaten with bread and then a soldier's pay
   or allowance (Polybius, and other late Greek writers) as in 1Co 9:7.
   Paul uses the singular of a preacher's pay (2Co 11:8) and the plural of
   the wages of sin (Ro 6:23) = death (death is the diet of sin).

   3:15 Were in expectation [prosdokOntos]. Genitive absolute of this
   striking verb already seen in 1:21. Reasoned [dialogizomenOn]. Genitive
   absolute again. John's preaching about the Messiah and the kingdom of
   God stirred the people deeply and set them to wondering. Whether haply
   he were the Christ [mepote autos eie ho Christos]. Optative [eie] in
   indirect question changed from the indicative in the direct (Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 1031). John wrought no miracles and was not in David's line
   and yet he moved people so mightily that they began to suspect that he
   himself [autos] was the Messiah. The Sanhedrin will one day send a
   formal committee to ask him this direct question (Joh 1:19).

   3:16 He that is mightier than I [ho ischuroteros mou]. Like Mr 1:7,
   "the one mightier than I." Ablative case [mou] of comparison. John
   would not turn aside for the flattery of the crowd. He was able to take
   his own measure in comparison with the Messiah and was loyal to him
   (see my John the Loyal). Compare Lu 3:16 with Mr 1:7f. and Mt 3:11f.
   for discussion of details. Luke has "fire" here after "baptize with the
   Holy Ghost" as Mt 3:11, which see. This bold Messianic picture in the
   Synoptic Gospels shows that John saw the Messiah's coming as a judgment
   upon the world like fire and the fan of the thrashing-floor, and with
   unquenchable fire for the chaff (Lu 3:17; Mt 3:12). But he had the
   spiritual conception also, the baptism in the Holy Spirit which will
   characterize the Messiah's Mission and so will far transcend the water
   baptism which marked the ministry of John.

   3:18 Many other exhortations [polla men oun kai hetera]. Literally,
   many and different things did John [evangelize], [euaggelizeto], to the
   people. Luke has given a bare sample of the wonderful messages of the
   Baptist. Few as his words preserved are they give a definite and
   powerful conception of his preaching.

   3:19 Reproved [elegchomenos]. Present passive participle of [elegchO],
   an old verb meaning in Homer to treat with contempt, then to convict
   (Mt 18:15), to expose (Eph 5:11), to reprove as here. The substantive
   [elegchos] means proof (Heb 11:1) and [elegmos], censure (2Ti 3:16).
   Josephus (Ant.XVIII. V.4) shows how repulsive this marriage was to
   Jewish feeling. Evil things [ponerOn]. Incorporated into the relative
   sentence. The word is from [ponos, poneO], toil, work, and gives the
   active side of evil, possibly with the notion of work itself as evil or
   at least an annoyance. The "evil eye" [ophthalmos poneros] in Mr 7:22)
   was a "mischief working eye" (Vincent). In Mt 6:23 it is a diseased
   eye. So Satan is "the evil one" (Mt 5:37; 6:13, etc.). It is a very
   common adjective in the N.T. as in the older Greek. Had done
   [epoiesen]. Aorist active indicative, not past perfect, merely a
   summary constative aorist, he did.

   3:20 Added [prosetheken]. First aorist active indicative (kappa
   aorist). Common verb [prostithemi] in all Greek. In N.T. chiefly in
   Luke and Acts. Hippocrates used it of applying wet sponges to the head
   and Galen of applying a decoction of acorns. There is no evidence that
   Luke has a medical turn to the word here. The absence of the
   conjunction [hoti] (that) before the next verb [katekleisen] (shut up)
   is asyndeton. This verb literally means shut down, possibly with a
   reference to closing down the door of the dungeon, though it makes
   sense as a perfective use of the preposition, like our "shut up"
   without a strict regard to the idea of "down." It is an old and common
   verb, though here and Ac 26:10 only in the N.T. See Mt 14:3 for further
   statement about the prison.

   3:21 When all the people were baptised [en tOi baptisthenai hapanta ton
   laon]. The use of the articular aorist infinitive here with [en]
   bothers some grammarians and commentators. There is no element of time
   in the aorist infinitive. It is simply punctiliar action, literally "in
   the being baptized as to all the people." Luke does not say that all
   the people were baptized before Jesus came or were baptized at the same
   time. It is merely a general statement that Jesus was baptized in
   connexion with or at the time of the baptizing of the people as a
   whole. Jesus also having been baptized [kai Iesou baptisthentos].
   Genitive absolute construction, first aorist passive participle. In
   Luke's sentence the baptism of Jesus is merely introductory to the
   descent of the Holy Spirit and the voice of the Father. For the
   narrative of the baptism see Mr 1:9; Mt 3:13-16. And praying [kai
   proseuchomenou]. Alone in Luke who so often mentions the praying of
   Jesus. Present participle and so naturally meaning that the heaven was
   opened while Jesus was praying though not necessarily in answer to his
   prayer. The heaven was opened [aneOichthenai ton ouranon]. First aorist
   passive infinitive with double augment, whereas the infinitive is not
   supposed to have any augment. The regular form would be [anoichthenai]
   as in D (Codex Bezae). So the augment appears in the future indicative
   [kateaxei] (Mt 12:20) and the second aorist passive subjunctive
   [kateagOsin] (Joh 19:31). Such unusual forms appear in the Koine.This
   infinitive here with the accusative of general reference is the subject
   of [egeneto] (it came to pass). Mt 3:16 uses the same verb, but Mr 1:10
   has [schizomenous], rent asunder.

   3:22 Descended [katabenai]. Same construction as the preceding
   infinitive. The Holy Ghost [to pneuma to hagion]. The Holy Spirit. Mr
   1:10 has merely the Spirit [to pneuma] while Mt 3:16 has the Spirit of
   God [pneuma theou]. In a bodily form [sOmatikOi eidei]. Alone in Luke
   who has also "as a dove" [hOs peristeran] like Matthew and Mark. This
   probably means that the Baptist saw the vision that looked like a dove.
   Nothing is gained by denying the fact or possibility of the vision that
   looked like a dove. God manifests his power as he will. The symbolism
   of the dove for the Holy Spirit is intelligible. We are not to
   understand that this was the beginning of the Incarnation of Christ as
   the Cerinthian Gnostics held. But this fresh influx of the Holy Spirit
   may have deepened the Messianic consciousness of Jesus and certainly
   revealed him to the Baptist as God's Son. And a voice came out of
   heaven [kai phOnen ex ouranou genesthai]. Same construction of
   infinitive with accusative of general reference. The voice of the
   Father to the Son is given here as in Mr 1:11, which see, and Mt 3:17
   for discussion of the variation there. The Trinity here manifest
   themselves at the baptism of Jesus which constitutes the formal
   entrance of Jesus upon his Messianic ministry. He enters upon it with
   the Father's blessing and approval and with the power of the Holy
   Spirit upon him. The deity of Christ here appears in plain form in the
   Synoptic Gospels. The consciousness of Christ is as clear on this point
   here as in the Gospel of John where the Baptist describes him after his
   baptism as the Son of God (Joh 1:34).

   3:23 Jesus Himself [autos Iesous]. Emphatic intensive pronoun calling
   attention to the personality of Jesus at this juncture. When he entered
   upon his Messianic work. When he began to teach [archomenos]. The words
   "to teach" are not in the Greek text. The Authorized Version "began to
   be about thirty years of age," is an impossible translation. The
   Revised Version rightly supplies "to teach" [didaskein] after the
   present participle [archomenos]. Either the infinitive or the
   participle can follow [archomai], usually the infinitive in the
   Koine.It is not necessary to supply anything (Ac 1:22). Was about
   thirty years of age [en hOsei etOn triakonta]. Tyndale has it right
   "Jesus was about thirty yere of age when he beganne." Luke does not
   commit himself definitely to precisely thirty years as the age of
   Christ. The Levites entered upon full service at that age, but that
   proves nothing about Jesus. God's prophets enter upon their task when
   the word of God comes to them. Jesus may have been a few months under
   or over thirty or a year or two less or more. Being Son (as was
   supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli (On huios hOs enomizeto IOseph tou
   Helei]. For the discussion of the genealogy of Jesus see on Mt 1:1-17.
   The two genealogies differ very widely and many theories have been
   proposed about them. At once one notices that Luke begins with Jesus
   and goes back to Adam, the Son of God, while Matthew begins with
   Abraham and comes to "Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus
   who is called Christ" (Mt 1:16). Matthew employs the word "begot" each
   time, while Luke has the article [tou] repeating [huiou] (Son) except
   before Joseph. They agree in the mention of Joseph, but Matthew says
   that "Jacob begat Joseph" while Luke calls "Joseph the son of Heli."
   There are other differences, but this one makes one pause. Joseph, of
   course, did not have two fathers. If we understand Luke to be giving
   the real genealogy of Jesus through Mary, the matter is simple enough.
   The two genealogies differ from Joseph to David except in the cases of
   Zorobabel and Salathiel. Luke evidently means to suggest something
   unusual in his genealogy by the use of the phrase "as was supposed"
   [hOs enomizeto]. His own narrative in Lu 1:26-38 has shown that Joseph
   was not the actual father of Jesus. Plummer objects that, if Luke is
   giving the genealogy of Jesus through Mary, [huios] must be used in two
   senses here (son as was supposed of Joseph, and grandson through Mary
   of Heli). But that is not an unheard of thing. In neither list does
   Matthew or Luke give a complete genealogy. Just as Matthew uses "begat"
   for descent, so does Luke employ "son" in the same way for descendant.
   It was natural for Matthew, writing for Jews, to give the legal
   genealogy through Joseph, though he took pains to show in Mt 1:16,18-25
   that Joseph was not the actual father of Jesus. It was equally natural
   for Luke, a Greek himself and writing for the whole world, to give the
   actual genealogy of Jesus through Mary. It is in harmony with Pauline
   universality (Plummer) that Luke carries the genealogy back to Adam and
   does not stop with Abraham. It is not clear why Luke adds "the Son of
   God" after Adam (3:38). Certainly he does not mean that Jesus is the
   Son of God only in the sense that Adam is. Possibly he wishes to
   dispose of the heathen myths about the origin of man and to show that
   God is the Creator of the whole human race, Father of all men in that
   sense. No mere animal origin of man is in harmony with this conception.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4

   4:1 Full of the Holy Spirit [pleres pneumatos hagiou]. An evident
   allusion to the descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at his baptism (Lu
   3:21f.). The distinctness of the Persons in the Trinity is shown there,
   but with evident unity. One recalls also Luke's account of the
   overshadowing of Mary by the Holy Spirit (1:35). Mt 4:1 says that
   "Jesus was led of the Spirit" while Mr 1:12 states that "the Spirit
   driveth him forth" which see for discussion. "Jesus had been endowed
   with supernatural power; and He was tempted to make use of it in
   furthering his own interests without regard to the Father's will"
   (Plummer). Was led by the Spirit [egeto en toi pneumati]. Imperfect
   passive, continuously led. [En] may be the instrumental use as often,
   for Mt 4:1 has here [hupo] of direct agency. But Matthew has the aorist
   passive [anechthe] which may be ingressive as he has [eis ten eremon]
   (into the wilderness) while Luke has [en tOi eremOi] (in the
   wilderness). At any rate Luke affirms that Jesus was now continuously
   under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Hence in this same sentence he
   mentions the Spirit twice. During the forty days [hemeras
   tesserakonta]. Accusative of duration of time, to be connected with
   "led" not with "tempted." He was led in the Spirit during these forty
   days (cf. De 8:2, forty years). The words are amphibolous also in Mr
   1:13. Mt 4:2 seems to imply that the three recorded temptations came at
   the close of the fasting for forty days. That can be true and yet what
   Luke states be true also. These three may be merely specimens and so
   "representative of the struggle which continued throughout the whole
   period" (Plummer).

   4:2 Being tempted [peirazomenos]. Present passive participle and
   naturally parallel with the imperfect passive [egeto] (was led) in
   verse 1. This is another instance of poor verse division which should
   have come at the end of the sentence. See on Mt 4:1; Mr 1:13 for the
   words "tempt" and "devil." The devil challenged the Son of man though
   also the Son of God. It was a contest between Jesus, full of the Holy
   Spirit, and the slanderer of men. The devil had won with Adam and Eve.
   He has hopes of triumph over Jesus. The story of this conflict is given
   only in Mt 4:1-11; Lu 4:1-13. There is a mere mention of it in Mr
   1:12f. So then here is a specimen of the Logia of Jesus (Q), a
   non-Markan portion of Matthew and Luke, the earliest document about
   Christ. The narrative could come ultimately only from Christ himself.
   It is noteworthy that it bears all the marks of the high conception of
   Jesus as the Son of God found in the Gospel of John and in Paul and
   Hebrews, the rest of the New Testament in fact, for Mark, Matthew,
   Luke, Acts, Peter, and Jude follow in this same strain. The point is
   that modern criticism has revealed the Messianic consciousness of Jesus
   as God's Son at his Baptism and in his Temptations at the very
   beginning of his ministry and in the oldest known documents about
   Christ (The Logia, Mark's Gospel). He did eat nothing [ouk ephagen
   ouden]. Second aorist (constative) active indicative of the defective
   verb [esthiO]. Mark does not give the fast. Mt 4:2 has the aorist
   active participle [nesteusas] which usually means a religious fast for
   purposes of devotion. That idea is not excluded by Luke's words. The
   entrance of Jesus upon his Messianic ministry was a fit time for this
   solemn and intense consecration. This mental and spiritual strain would
   naturally take away the appetite and there was probably nothing at hand
   to eat. The weakness from the absence of food gave the devil his
   special opportunity to tempt Jesus which he promptly seized. When they
   were completed [suntelestheisOn autOn]. Genitive absolute with the
   first aorist passive participle feminine plural because [hemerOn]
   (days) is feminine. According to Luke the hunger [epeinasen], became
   hungry, ingressive aorist active indicative) came at the close of the
   forty days as in Mt 4:2.

   4:3 The Son of God [huios tou theou]. No article as in Mt 4:3. So
   refers to the relationship as Son of God rather than to the office of
   Messiah. Manifest reference to the words of the Father in Lu 3:22.
   Condition of the first class as in Matthew. The devil assumes that
   Jesus is Son of God. This stone [tOi lithOi toutOi]. Perhaps pointing
   to a particular round stone that looked in shape and size like a loaf
   of bread. Stanley (Sinai and Palestine, p. 154) on Mt. Carmel found
   crystallizations of stones called "Elijah's melons." The hunger of
   Jesus opened the way for the diabolic suggestion designed to inspire
   doubt in Jesus toward his Father. Matthew has "these stones." Bread
   [artos]. Better "loaf." For discussion of this first temptation see on
   Mt 4:3f. Jesus felt the force of each of the temptations without
   yielding at all to the sin involved. See discussion on Matthew also for
   reality of the devil and the objective and subjective elements in the
   temptations. Jesus quotes De 8:3 in reply to the devil.

   4:5 The world [tes oikoumenes]. The inhabited world. In Mt 4:8 it is
   [tou kosmou]. In a moment of time [en stigmei chronou]. Only in Luke
   and the word [stigme] nowhere else in the N.T. (from [stizO], to prick,
   or puncture), a point or dot. In Demosthenes, Aristotle, Plutarch. Like
   our "second" of time or tick of the clock. This panorama of all the
   kingdoms of the world and the glory of them in a moment of time was
   mental, a great feat of the imagination (a mental satanic "movie"
   performance), but this fact in no way discredits the idea of the actual
   visible appearance of Satan also. This second temptation in Luke is the
   third in Matthew's order. Luke's order is geographical (wilderness,
   mountain, Jerusalem). Matthew's is climacteric (hunger, nervous dread,
   ambition). There is a climax in Luke's order also (sense, man, God).
   There is no way to tell the actual order.

   4:6 All this authority [ten exousian tauten hapasan]. Mt 4:9 has "all
   these things." Luke's report is more specific. And the glory of them
   [kai ten doxan autOn]. Mt 4:8 has this in the statement of what the
   devil did, not what he said. For it hath been delivered unto me [hoti
   emoi paradedotai]. Perfect passive indicative. Satan here claims
   possession of world power and Jesus does not deny it. It may be due to
   man's sin and by God's permission. Jesus calls Satan the ruler of this
   world (Joh 12:31; 14:30; 16:11). To whomsoever I will [hoi an thelO].
   Present subjunctive with [an] in an indefinite relative sentence. This
   audacious claim, if allowed, makes one wonder whether some of the world
   rulers are not, consciously or unconsciously, agents of the devil. In
   several American cities there has been proven a definite compact
   between the police and the underworld of crime. But the tone of Satan
   here is one of superiority to Jesus in world power. He offers him a
   share in it on one condition.

   4:7 Wilt worship before me [proskuneseis enOpion emou]. Mt 4:9 has it
   more bluntly "worship me." That is what it really comes to, though in
   Luke the matter is more delicately put. It is a condition of the third
   class [ean] and the subjunctive). Luke has it "thou therefore if" [su
   oun ean], in a very emphatic and subtle way. It is the ingressive
   aorist [proskuneseis], just bow the knee once up here in my presence.
   The temptation was for Jesus to admit Satan's authority by this act of
   prostration (fall down and worship), a recognition of authority rather
   than of personal merit. It shall all be thine [estai sou pasa]. Satan
   offers to turn over all the keys of world power to Jesus. It was a
   tremendous grand-stand play, but Jesus saw at once that in that case he
   would be the agent of Satan in the rule of the world by bargain and
   graft instead of the Son of God by nature and world ruler by conquest
   over Satan. The heart of Satan's program is here laid bare. Jesus here
   rejected the Jewish idea of the Messiah as an earthly ruler merely. "He
   rejects Satan as an ally, and thereby has him as an implacable enemy"
   (Plummer.)

   4:8 Thou shalt worship [proskuneseis]. Satan used this verb to Jesus
   who turns it against him by the quotation from De 6:13. Jesus clearly
   perceived that one could not worship both Satan and God. He had to
   choose whom he would serve. Luke does not give the words, "Get thee
   hence, Satan" (Mt 4:10), for he has another temptation to narrate.

   4:9 Led him [egagen]. Aorist active indicative of [agO]. Mt 4:5 has
   [paralambanei] (dramatic present). The wing of the temple [to pterugion
   tou hierou]. See on Mt 4:5. It is not easy to determine precisely what
   it was. From hence [enteuthen]. This Luke adds to the words in Matthew,
   which see. To guard thee [tou diaphulaxai se]. Not in Mt 4:6 quoted by
   Satan from Ps 91:11,12. Satan does not misquote this Psalm, but he
   misapplies it and makes it mean presumptuous reliance on God. This
   compound verb is very old, but occurs here alone in the N.T. and that
   from the LXX. Luke repeats [hoti] (recitative [hoti] after [gegraptai],
   is written) after this part of the quotation.

   4:12 It is said [eiretai]. Perfect passive indicative, stands said, a
   favourite way of quoting Scripture in the N.T. In Mt 4:7 we have the
   usual "it is written" [gegraptai]. Here Jesus quotes De 6:16. Each time
   he uses Deuteronomy against the devil. The LXX is quoted. It is the
   volitive future indicative with [ouk], a common prohibition. Jesus
   points out to the devil that testing God is not trusting God (Plummer).

   4:13 Every temptation [panta peirasmon]. These three kinds exhaust the
   avenues of approach (the appetites, the nerves, the ambitions). Satan
   tried them all. They formed a cycle (Vincent). Hence "he was in all
   points tempted like as we are" (Heb 4:15). "The enemy tried all his
   weapons, and was at all points defeated" (Plummer). Probably all during
   the forty days the devil tempted him, but three are representatives of
   all. For a season [achri kairou]. Until a good opportunity should
   return, the language means. We are thus to infer that the devil
   returned to his attack from time to time. In the Garden of Gethsemane
   he tempted Jesus more severely than here. He was here trying to thwart
   the purpose of Jesus to go on with his Messianic plans, to trip him at
   the start. In Gethsemane the devil tried to make Jesus draw back from
   the culmination of the Cross with all its agony and horror. The devil
   attacked Jesus by the aid of Peter (Mr 8:33), through the Pharisees
   (Joh 8:40ff.), besides Gethsemane (Lu 22:42, 53).

   4:14 Returned [hupestrepsen]. Luke does not fill in the gap between the
   temptations in the wilderness of Judea and the Galilean Ministry. He
   follows the outline of Mark. It is John's Gospel alone that tells of
   the year of obscurity (Stalker) in various parts of the Holy Land. In
   the power of the Spirit [en tei dunamei tou pneumatos]. Luke in these
   two verses (14, 15) gives a description of the Galilean Ministry with
   three marked characteristics (Plummer): the power of the spirit, rapid
   spread of Christ's fame, use of the Jewish synagogues. Luke often notes
   the power of the Holy Spirit in the work of Christ. Our word dynamite
   is this same word [dunamis] (power). A fame (pheme]. An old Greek word
   found in the N.T. only here and Mt 9:26. It is from [phemi], to say.
   Talk ran rapidly in every direction. It assumes the previous ministry
   as told by John.

   4:15 And he taught [kai autos edidasken]. Luke is fond of this mode of
   transition so that it is not certain that he means to emphasize "he
   himself" as distinct from the rumour about him. It is the imperfect
   tense, descriptive of the habit of Jesus. The synagogues were an open
   door to Jesus before the hostility of the Pharisees was aroused. Being
   glorified [doxazomenos]. Present passive participle, durative action
   like the imperfect [edidasken]. General admiration of Jesus everywhere.
   He was the wonder teacher of his time. Even the rabbis had not yet
   learned how to ridicule and oppose Jesus.

   4:16 Where he had been brought up [hou en tethrammenos]. Past perfect
   passive periphrastic indicative, a state of completion in past time,
   from [trephO], a common Greek verb. This visit is before that recorded
   in Mr 6:1-6; Mt 13:54-58 which was just before the third tour of
   Galilee. Here Jesus comes back after a year of public ministry
   elsewhere and with a wide reputation (Lu 4:15). Luke may have in mind
   2:51, but for some time now Nazareth had not been his home and that
   fact may be implied by the past perfect tense. As his custom was [kata
   to eiOthos autOi]. Second perfect active neuter singular participle of
   an old [ethO] (Homer), to be accustomed. Literally according to what
   was customary to him [autOi], dative case). This is one of the
   flashlights on the early life of Jesus. He had the habit of going to
   public worship in the synagogue as a boy, a habit that he kept up when
   a grown man. If the child does not form the habit of going to church,
   the man is almost certain not to have it. We have already had in
   Matthew and Mark frequent instances of the word synagogue which played
   such a large part in Jewish life after the restoration from Babylon.
   Stood up [aneste]. Second aorist active indicative and intransitive.
   Very common verb. It was the custom for the reader to stand except when
   the Book of Esther was read at the feast of Purim when he might sit. It
   is not here stated that Jesus had been in the habit of standing up to
   read here or elsewhere. It was his habit to go to the synagogue for
   worship. Since he entered upon his Messianic work his habit was to
   teach in the synagogues (Lu 4:15). This was apparently the first time
   that he had done so in Nazareth. He may have been asked to read as Paul
   was in Antioch in Pisidia (Ac 13:15). The ruler of the synagogue for
   that day may have invited Jesus to read and speak because of his now
   great reputation as a teacher. Jesus could have stood up voluntarily
   and appropriately because of his interest in his home town. To read
   [anagnOnai]. Second aorist active infinitive of [anaginOskO], to
   recognize again the written characters and so to read and then to read
   aloud. It appears first in Pindar in the sense of read and always so in
   the N.T. This public reading aloud with occasional comments may explain
   the parenthesis in Mt 24:15 (Let him that readeth understand).

   4:17 Was delivered [epedothe]. First aorist passive indicative of
   [epididOmi], to give over to, a common verb. At the proper stage of the
   service "the attendant" or "minister" [huperetes], under rower) or
   "beadle" took out a roll of the law from the ark, unwrapped it, and
   gave it to some one to read. On sabbath days some seven persons were
   asked to read small portions of the law. This was the first lesson or
   Parashah.This was followed by a reading from the prophets and a
   discourse, the second lesson or Haphtarah.This last is what Jesus did.
   The book of the prophet Isaiah [biblion tou prophetou Esaiou].
   Literally, "a roll of the prophet Isaiah." Apparently Isaiah was handed
   to Jesus without his asking for it. But certainly Jesus cared more for
   the prophets than for the ceremonial law. It was a congenial service
   that he was asked to perform. Jesus used Deuteronomy in his temptations
   and now Isaiah for this sermon. The Syriac Sinaitic manuscript has it
   that Jesus stood up after the attendant handed him the roll. Opened
   [anoixas]. Really it was unrolled [anaptuxas] as Aleph D have it. But
   the more general term [anoixas] (from [anoigO], common verb) is
   probably genuine. [AnaptussO] does not occur in the N.T. outside of
   this passage if genuine. Found the place [heuren ton topon]. Second
   aorist active indicative. He continued to unroll (rolling up the other
   side) till he found the passage desired. It may have been a fixed
   lesson for the day or it may have been his own choosing. At any rate it
   was a marvellously appropriate passage (Isa 61:1,2 with one clause
   omitted and some words from Isa 58:6). It is a free quotation from the
   Septuagint. Where it was written [hou en gegrammenon]. Periphrastic
   pluperfect passive again as in 4:16.

   4:18 Anointed me [echrisen me]. First aorist active indicative of the
   verb [chriO] from which Christ [Christos] is derived, the Anointed One.
   Isaiah is picturing the Jubilee year and the release of captives and
   the return from the Babylonian exile with the hope of the Messiah
   through it all. Jesus here applies this Messianic language to himself.
   "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me" as was shown at the baptism (Lu
   3:21) where he was also "anointed" for his mission by the Father's
   voice (3:22). To the poor [ptOchois]. Jesus singles this out also as
   one of the items to tell John the Baptist in prison (Lu 7:22). Our word
   Gospel is a translation of the Greek [Euaggelion], and it is for the
   poor. He hath sent me [apestalken me]. Change of tense to perfect
   active indicative. He is now on that mission here. Jesus is God's
   Apostle to men (Joh 17:3, Whom thou didst send). Proclaim [keruxai]. As
   a herald like Noah (2Pe 2:5). To the captives [aichmalOtois]. Prisoners
   of war will be released [aichme], a spear point, and [halOtos], from
   [haliskomai], to be captured). Captured by the spear point. Common
   word, but here only in the N.T. Set at liberty [aposteilai]. First
   aorist active infinitive of [apostellO]. Same verb as [apestalken],
   above. Brought in here from Isa 58:6. Plummer suggests that Luke
   inserts it here from memory. But Jesus could easily have turned back
   the roll and read it so. Them that are bruised [tethrausmenous].
   Perfect passive participle of [thrauO], an old verb, but here only in
   the N.T. It means to break in pieces broken in heart and often in body
   as well. One loves to think that Jesus felt it to be his mission to
   mend broken hearts like pieces of broken earthenware, real
   rescue-mission work. Jesus mends them and sets them free from their
   limitations.

   4:19 The acceptable year of the Lord [eniauton Kuriou dekton]. He does
   not mean that his ministry is to be only one year in length as Clement
   of Alexandria and Origen argued. That is to turn figures into fact. The
   Messianic age has come, Jesus means to say. On the first day of the
   year of Jubilee the priests with sound of trumpet proclaimed the
   blessings of that year (Le 25:8-17). This great passage justly pictures
   Christ's conception of his mission and message.

   4:20 He closed the book [ptuxas to biblion]. Aorist active participle
   of [ptussO]. Rolled up the roll and gave it back to the attendant who
   had given it to him and who put it away again in its case. Sat down
   [ekathisen]. Took his seat there as a sign that he was going to speak
   instead of going back to his former seat. This was the usual Jewish
   attitude for public speaking and teaching (Lu 5:3; Mt 5:1; Mr 4:1; Ac
   16:13). Were fastened on him [esan atenizontes autOi]. Periphrastic
   imperfect active and so a vivid description. Literally, the eyes of all
   in the synagogue were gazing fixedly upon him. The verb [atenizO]
   occurs in Aristotle and the Septuagint. It is from the adjective
   [atenes] and that from [teinO], to stretch, and copulative or intensive
   [a], not [a] privative. The word occurs in the N.T. here and in 22:56,
   ten times in Acts, and in 2Co 3:7, 13. Paul uses it of the steady eager
   gaze of the people at Moses when he came down from the mountain when he
   had been communing with God. There was something in the look of Jesus
   here that held the people spellbound for the moment, apart from the
   great reputation with which he came to them. In small measure every
   effective speaker knows what it is to meet the eager expectations of an
   audience.

   4:21 And he began to say [erxato de legein]. Aorist ingressive active
   indicative and present infinitive. He began speaking. The moment of
   hushed expectancy was passed. These may or may not be the first words
   uttered here by Jesus. Often the first sentence is the crucial one in
   winning an audience. Certainly this is an arresting opening sentence.
   Hath been fulfilled [peplerOtai]. Perfect passive indicative, stands
   fulfilled. "Today this scripture (Isa 61:1, 2, just read) stands
   fulfilled in your ears." It was a most amazing statement and the people
   of Nazareth were quick to see the Messianic claim involved. Jesus could
   only mean that the real year of Jubilee had come, that the Messianic
   prophecy of Isaiah had come true today, and that in him they saw the
   Messiah of prophecy. There are critics today who deny that Jesus
   claimed to be the Messiah. To be able to do that, they must reject the
   Gospel of John and all such passages as this one. And it is no
   apocalyptic eschatological Messiah whom Jesus here sets forth, but the
   one who forgives sin and binds up the broken-hearted. The words were
   too good to be true and to be spoken here at Nazareth by one of their
   own townsmen!

   4:22 Bare him witness [emarturoun]. Imperfect active, perhaps
   inchoative. They all began to bear witness that the rumours were not
   exaggerations (4:14) as they had supposed, but had foundation in fact
   if this discourse or its start was a fair sample of his teaching. The
   verb [martureO] is a very old and common one. It is frequent in Acts,
   Paul's Epistles, and the Johannine books. The substantive [martur] is
   seen in our English [martyr], one who witnesses even by his death to
   his faith in Christ. And wondered [kai ethaumazon]. Imperfect active
   also, perhaps inchoative also. They began to marvel as he proceeded
   with his address. This verb is an old one and common in the Gospels for
   the attitude of the people towards Jesus. At the words of grace [epi
   tois logois tes charitos]. See on Lu 1:30; 2:52 for this wonderful word
   [charis] so full of meaning and so often in the N.T. The genitive case
   (case of genus or kind) here means that the words that came out of the
   mouth of Jesus in a steady stream (present tense, [ekporeuomenois] were
   marked by fascination and charm. They were "winning words" as the
   context makes plain, though they were also "gracious" in the Pauline
   sense of "grace." There is no necessary antithesis in the ideas of
   graceful and gracious in these words of Jesus. Is not this Joseph's
   son? [Ouchi huios estin IOseph houtos;]. Witness and wonder gave way to
   bewilderment as they began to explain to themselves the situation. The
   use of [ouchi] intensive form of [ouk] in a question expects the answer
   "yes." Jesus passed in Nazareth as the son of Joseph as Luke presents
   him in 3:23. He does not stop here to correct this misconception
   because the truth has been already amply presented in 1:28-38; 2:49.
   This popular conception of Jesus as the son of Joseph appears also in
   Joh 1:45. The puzzle of the people was due to their previous knowledge
   of Jesus as the carpenter (Mr 6:3; the carpenter's son, Mt 13:55). For
   him now to appear as the Messiah in Nazareth where he had lived and
   laboured as the carpenter was a phenomenon impossible to credit on
   sober reflection. So the mood of wonder and praise quickly turned with
   whispers and nods and even scowls to doubt and hostility, a rapid and
   radical transformation of emotion in the audience.

   4:23 Doubtless [pantOs]. Adverb. Literally, at any rate, certainly,
   assuredly. Cf. Ac 21:22; 28:4. This parable [ten parabolen tauten]. See
   discussion on Mt 13. Here the word has a special application to a crisp
   proverb which involves a comparison. The word physician is the point of
   comparison. Luke the physician alone gives this saying of Jesus. The
   proverb means that the physician was expected to take his own medicine
   and to heal himself. The word [parabole] in the N.T. is confined to the
   Synoptic Gospels except Heb 9:9; 11:19. This use for a proverb occurs
   also in Lu 5:36; 6:39. This proverb in various forms appears not only
   among the Jews, but in Euripides and Aeschylus among the Greeks, and in
   Cicero's Letters.Hobart quotes the same idea from Galen, and the
   Chinese used to demand it of their physicians. The point of the parable
   seems to be that the people were expecting him to make good his claim
   to the Messiahship by doing here in Nazareth what they had heard of his
   doing in Capernaum and elsewhere. "Establish your claims by direct
   evidence" (Easton). This same appeal (Vincent) was addressed to Christ
   on the Cross (Mt 27:40,42). There is a tone of sarcasm towards Jesus in
   both cases. Heard done [ekousamen genomena]. The use of this second
   aorist middle participle [genomena] after [ekousamen] is a neat Greek
   idiom. It is punctiliar action in indirect discourse after this verb of
   sensation or emotion (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1040-42, 1122-24). Do
   also here [poieson kai hOde]. Ingressive aorist active imperative. Do
   it here in thy own country and town and do it now. Jesus applies the
   proverb to himself as an interpretation of their real attitude towards
   himself.

   4:24 And he said [eipen de]. Also in 1:13. The interjection of these
   words here by Luke may indicate a break in his address, though there is
   no other indication of an interval here. Perhaps they only serve to
   introduce solemnly the new proverb like the words Verily I say unto you
   [amen legO humin]. This proverb about the prophet having no honour in
   his own country Jesus had already applied to himself according to Joh
   4:44. Both Mr 6:4 and Mt 13:57 give it in a slightly altered form on
   the last visit of Jesus to Nazareth. The devil had tempted Jesus to
   make a display of his power to the people by letting them see him
   floating down from the pinnacle of the temple (Lu 4:9-11).

   4:25 Three years and six months [ete tria kai menas hex]. Accusative of
   duration of time without [epi] (doubtful). The same period is given in
   Jas 5:17, the popular Jewish way of speaking. In 1Ki 18:1 the rain is
   said to have come in the third year. But the famine probably lasted
   still longer.

   4:26 Unto Zarephath [eis Sarepta]. The modern village Surafend on the
   coast road between Tyre and Sidon. Unto a woman that was a widow [pros
   gunaika cheran]. Literally, unto a woman a widow (like our vernacular
   widow woman). This is an illustration of the proverb from the life of
   Elijah (1Ki 17:8,9). This woman was in the land of Sidon or Phoenicia,
   a heathen, where Jesus himself will go later.

   4:27 In the time of Elisha the prophet [epi Elisaiou tou prophetou].
   This use of [epi] with the genitive for "in the time of" is a good
   Greek idiom. The second illustration of the proverb is from the time of
   Elisha and is another heathen, Naaman the Syrian [Naiman ho Syros]. He
   was the lone leper that was cleansed by Elisha (2Ki 5:1,14).

   4:28 They were all filled with wrath [eplesthesan pantes thumou]. First
   aorist passive indicative of the common verb [pimplemi] followed by the
   genitive case. The people of Nazareth at once caught on and saw the
   point of these two Old Testament illustrations of how God in two cases
   blessed the heathen instead of the Jewish people. The implication was
   evident. Nazareth was no better than Capernaum if as good. He was under
   no special obligation to do unusual things in Nazareth because he had
   been reared there. Town pride was insulted and it at once exploded in a
   burst of rage.

   4:29 They rose up and cast him forth [anastantes exebalon]. Second
   aorist ingressive active participle and second aorist effective active
   indicative. A movement towards lynching Jesus. Unto the brow of the
   hill [heos ophruos tou orous]. Eyebrow [ophrus], in Homer, then any
   jutting prominence. Only here in the N.T. Hippocrates speaks of the
   eyebrow hanging over. Was built [Oikodometo]. Past perfect indicative,
   stood built. That they might throw him down headlong [hOste
   katakremnisai auton]. Neat Greek idiom with [hOste] for intended
   result, "so as to cast him down the precipice." The infinitive alone
   can convey the same meaning (Mt 2:2; 20:28; Lu 2:23). [Kremnos] is an
   overhanging bank or precipice from [kremannumi], to hang. [Kata] is
   down. The verb occurs in Xenophon, Demosthenes, LXX, Josephus. Here
   only in the N.T. At the southwest corner of the town of Nazareth such a
   cliff today exists overhanging the Maronite convent. Murder was in the
   hearts of the people. By pushing him over they hoped to escape
   technical guilt.

   4:30 He went his way [eporeueto]. Imperfect tense, he was going on his
   way.

   4:31 Came down [katelthen]. Mr 1:21 has the historical present, they go
   into [eisporeuontai]. Capernaum (Tell Hum) is now the headquarters of
   the Galilean ministry, since Nazareth has rejected Jesus. Lu 4:31-37 is
   parallel with Mr 1:21-28 which he manifestly uses. It is the first of
   Christ's miracles which they give. Was teaching them [en didaskOn
   autous]. Periphrastic imperfect. Mark has [edidasken] first and then
   [en didaskOn]. "Them" here means the people present in the synagogue on
   the sabbath, construction according to sense as in Mr 1:22.

   4:32 Rest of the sentence as in Mark, which see, except that Luke omits
   "and not as their scribes" and uses [hoti en] instead of [hOs echOn].

   4:33 Which had [echOn]. Mark has [en]. A spirit of an unclean demon
   [pneuma daimoniou akathartou]. Mark has "unclean spirit." Luke's phrase
   here is unique in this combination. Plummer notes that Matthew has
   [daimonion] ten times and [akatharton] twice as an epithet of [pneuma];
   Mark has [daimonion] thirteen times and [akatharton] eleven times as an
   epithet of [pneuma]. Luke's Gospel uses [daimonion] twenty-two times
   and [akatharton] as an epithet, once of [daimonion] as here and once of
   [pneuma]. In Mark the man is in [en] the power of the unclean spirit,
   while here the man "has" a spirit of an unclean demon. With a loud
   voice [phOnei megalei]. Not in Mark. Really a scream caused by the
   sudden contact of the demon with Jesus.

   4:34 Ah! [Ea]. An interjection frequent in the Attic poets, but rare in
   prose. Apparently second person singular imperative of [eaO], to
   permit. It is expressive of wonder, fear, indignation. Here it amounts
   to a diabolical screech. For the rest of the verse see discussion on Mr
   1:24 and Mt 8:29. The muzzle [phimos] occurs literally in 1Co 9:9, 1Ti
   5:18, and metaphorically here and Mr 1:25; 4:39; Mt 22:12.

   4:35 Had thrown him down in the midst [rhipsan auton eis to meson].
   First aorist (effective) participle of [rhiptO], an old verb with
   violent meaning, to fling, throw, hurl off or down. Having done him no
   hurt [meden blapsan auton]. Luke as a physician carefully notes this
   important detail not in Mark. [BlaptO], to injure, or hurt, occurs in
   the N.T. only here and in Mr 16:18, though a very common verb in the
   old Greek.

   4:36 Amazement came [egeneto thambos]. Mark has [ethambethesan]. They
   spake together one with another [sunelaloun pros allelous]. Imperfect
   indicative active and the reciprocal pronoun. Mark has simply the
   infinitive [sunzetein] (question). For [hoti]. We have here an
   ambiguous [hoti] as in 1:45, which can be either the relative "that" or
   the casual [hoti] "because" or "for," as the Revised Version has it.
   Either makes good sense. Luke adds here [dunamei] (with power) to
   Mark's "authority" [exousian]. And they come out [exerchontai]. So Luke
   where Mark has "and they obey him" [kai upakouousin autOi].

   4:37 Went forth a rumour [exeporeueto echos]. Imperfect middle, kept on
   going forth. Our very word [echo] in this word. Late Greek form for
   [echO] in the old Greek. Used for the roar of the waves on the shore.
   So in Lu 21:25. Vivid picture of the resounding influence of this day's
   work in the synagogue, in Capernaum.

   4:38 He rose up [anastas]. Second aorist active participle of
   [anistemi], a common verb. B. Weiss adds here "from the teacher's
   seat." Either from his seat or merely leaving the synagogue. This
   incident of the healing of Peter's mother-in-law is given in Mr 1:29-34
   and Mt 8:14-17, which see for details. Into the house of Simon [eis ten
   oikian SimOnos]. "Peter's house" (Mt 8:14). "The house of Simon and
   Andrew" (Mr 1:29). Paul's reference to Peter's wife (1Co 9:5) is
   pertinent. They lived together in Capernaum. This house came also to be
   the Capernaum home of Jesus. Simon's wife's mother [penthera tou
   SimOnos]. The word [penthera] for mother-in-law is old and well
   established in usage. Besides the parallel passages (Mr 1:30; Mt 8:14;
   Lu 4:38) it occurs in the N.T. only in Lu 12:53. The corresponding word
   [pentheros], father-in-law, occurs in Joh 18:13 alone in the N.T. Was
   holden with a great fever [en sunechomene puretOi megalOi].
   Periphrastic imperfect passive, the analytical tense accenting the
   continuous fever, perhaps chronic and certainly severe. Luke employs
   this verb nine times and only three others in the N.T. (Mt 4:24 passive
   with diseases here; 2Co 5:14 active; Php 1:23 passive). In Ac 28:8 the
   passive "with dysentery" is like the construction here and is a common
   one in Greek medical writers as in Greek literature generally. Luke
   uses the passive with "fear," Lu 8:37, the active for holding the hands
   over the ears (Ac 7:57) and for pressing one or holding together (Lu
   8:45; 19:43; 22:63), the direct middle for holding oneself to preaching
   (Ac 18:5). It is followed here by the instrumental case. Hobart
   (Medical Language of Luke, p. 3) quotes Galen as dividing fevers into
   "great" [megaloi] and "small" [smikroi].

   4:39 He stood over her [epistas epanO autes]. Second aorist active
   participle. Only in Luke. Surely we are not to take Luke to mean that
   Jesus here took the exorcist's position and was rebuking a malignant
   personality. The attitude of Jesus is precisely that of any kindly
   sympathetic physician. Mr 1:31; Mt 8:15 mention the touch of her hand
   rather than the tender look over her head. Rebuked [epetimesen]. Only
   in Luke. Jesus bade the fever leave her as he spoke to the wind and the
   waves and Luke uses this same verb (8:24). Rose up and ministered
   [anastasa diekonei]. Second aorist active participle as in verse 38,
   but inchoative imperfect tense [diekonei], from [diakoneO] (note
   augment of compound verb). She rose up immediately, though a long high
   fever usually leaves one very weak. The cure was instantaneous and
   complete. She began to minister at once and kept it up.

   4:40 When the sun was setting [dunontos tou heliou]. Genitive absolute
   and present participle [dunO], late form of [duO] picturing the sunset
   scene. Even Mr 1:32 has here the aorist indicative [edusen] (punctiliar
   active). It was not only cooler, but it was the end of the sabbath when
   it was not regarded as work (Vincent) to carry a sick person (Joh
   5:10). And also by now the news of the cure of the demoniac of Peter's
   mother-in-law had spread all over the town. Had [eichon]. Imperfect
   tense including all the chronic cases. With divers diseases [nosois
   poikilais]. Instrumental case. For "divers" say "many coloured" or
   "variegated." See on Mt 4:24; Mr 1:34. Brought [egagon]. Constative
   summary second aorist active indicative like Mt 8:16, [prosenegkan],
   where Mr 1:32 has the imperfect [epheron], brought one after another.
   He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them [ho de heni
   hekastOi autOn tas cheiras epititheis etherapeuen autous]. Note the
   present active participle [epititheis] and the imperfect active
   [etherapeuen], picturing the healing one by one with the tender touch
   upon each one. Luke alone gives this graphic detail which was more than
   a mere ceremonial laying on of hands. Clearly the cures of Jesus
   reached the physical, mental, and spiritual planes of human nature. He
   is Lord of life and acted here as Master of each case as it came.

   4:41 Came out [exercheto], singular, or [exerchonto], plural).
   Imperfect tense, repetition, from one after another. Thou art the Son
   of God [Su ei ho huios tou theou]. More definite statement of the deity
   of Jesus than the witness of the demoniac in the synagogue (Lu 4:34; Mr
   1:24), like the words of the Father (Lu 3:22) and more so than the
   condition of the devil (Lu 4:3, 9). In the Canterbury Revision "devils"
   should always be "demons" [daimonia] as here. Suffered them not to
   speak [ouk eia auta lalein]. Imperfect third singular active of [eaO],
   very old and common verb with syllabic augment [ei]. The tense accents
   the continued refusal of Jesus to receive testimony to his person and
   work from demons. Cf. Mt 8:4 to the lepers. Because they knew [hoti
   eideisan]. Causal, not declarative, [hoti]. Past perfect of the second
   perfect [oida]. That he was the Christ [ton Christon auton einai].
   Infinitive in indirect assertion with the accusative of general
   reference. [Ton Christon] = the Anointed, the Messiah.

   4:42 When it was day [genomenes hemeras]. Genitive absolute with aorist
   middle participle. Mr 1:35 notes it was "a great while before day"
   (which see for discussion) when Jesus rose up to go after a restless
   night. No doubt, because of the excitement of the previous sabbath in
   Capernaum. He went out to pray (Mr 1:35). Sought after him [epezetoun
   auton]. Imperfect active indicative. The multitudes kept at it until
   "they came unto him" [elthon heOs autou], aorist active indicative).
   They accomplished their purpose, [heOs autou], right up to him. Would
   have stayed him [kateichon auton]. Better, They tried to hinder him.
   The conative imperfect active of [katechO], an old and common verb. It
   means either to hold fast (Lu 8:15), to take, get possession of (Lu
   14:9) or to hold back, to retain, to restrain (Phm 1:13; Ro 1:18; 7:6;
   2Th 2:6; Lu 4:42). In this passage it is followed by the ablative case.
   That he should not go from them [tou me poreuesthai ap' autOn].
   Literally, "from going away from them." The use of [me] (not) after
   [kateichon] is the neat Greek idiom of the redundant negative after a
   verb of hindering like the French ne (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1171) .

   4:43 I must [me dei]. Jesus felt the urge to go with the work of
   evangelism "to the other cities also," to all, not to a favoured few.
   For therefore was I sent [hoti epi touto apestalen]. "A phrase of
   Johannine ring" (Ragg). Second aorist passive indicative of
   [apostellO]. Christ is the great Apostle of God to men.

   4:44 Was preaching [en kerussOn]. Periphrastic imperfect active,
   describing his first tour of Galilee in accord with the purpose just
   stated. One must fill in details, though Mr 1:39 and Mt 8:23-25 tell of
   the mass of work done on this campaign.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 5

   5:1 Pressed upon him [epikeisthai]. Luke in this paragraph (5:1-11; Mr
   1:16-20; Mt 4:18-22) does not follow the chronology of Mark as he
   usually does. It seems reasonably clear that the renewed call of the
   four fishermen came before the first tour of Galilee in Lu 4:42-44. It
   is here assumed that Luke is describing in his own way the incident
   given in Mark and Matthew above. Luke singles out Simon in a graphic
   way. This verb [epikeisthai] is an old one and means to [lie upon],
   rest upon as of a stone on the tomb (Joh 11:38) or of fish on the
   burning coals (Joh 21:9). So it is used of a tempest (Ac 27:20) and of
   the urgent demands for Christ's crucifixion (Lu 23:23). Here it vividly
   pictures the eager crowds around Jesus. [En tOi epikeisthai] is a
   favourite idiom with Luke as we have already seen, [en] with the
   articular infinitive in the locative case. That [kai]. [Kai] does not
   technically mean the declarative conjunction "that," but it is a fair
   rendering of the somewhat awkward idiom of Luke to a certain extent
   imitating the Hebrew use of wav.Was standing [en hestOs]. Periphrastic
   second past perfect of [histemi] which here is equal to a practical
   imperfect. By the lake [para ten limnen]. The use of the accusative
   with [para], alongside, after a verb of rest used to be called the
   pregnant use, came and was standing. But that is no longer necessary,
   for the accusative as the case of extension is the oldest of the cases
   and in later Greek regains many of the earlier uses of the other cases
   employed for more precise distinctions. See the same idiom in verse 2.
   We need not here stress the notion of extension. "With characteristic
   accuracy Luke never calls it a sea, while the others never call it a
   lake" (Plummer).

   5:2 Two boats [ploia duo]. Some MSS. have [ploiaria], little boats, but
   [ploia] was used of boats of various sizes, even of ships like [nees].
   The fishermen [hoi haleeis]. It is an old Homeric word that has come
   back to common use in the Koine.It means "sea-folk" from [hals], sea.
   Were washing [eplunon]. Imperfect active, though some MSS. have aorist
   [eplunan]. Vincent comments on Luke's use of five verbs for washing:
   this one for cleaning, [apomassO] for wiping the dust from one's feet
   (10:11), [ekmassO] of the sinful woman wiping Christ's feet with her
   hair (7:38, 44), [apolouO] of washing away sins (symbolically, of
   course) as in Ac 22:16, and [louO] of washing the body of Dorcas (Ac
   9:37) and the stripes of the prisoners (Ac 16:33). On "nets" see on Mt
   4:20; Mr 1:18.

   5:3 To put out a little [epanagagein oligon]. Second aorist infinitive
   of the double compound verb [ep-an-agO], found in Xenophon and late
   Greek writers generally. Only twice in the N.T. In Mt 21:18 in the
   sense of leading back or returning and here in the sense of leading a
   ship up upon the sea, to put out to sea, a nautical term. Taught
   [edikasken]. Imperfect active, picturing Jesus teaching from the boat
   in which he was seated and so safe from the jam of the crowd. "Christ
   uses Peter's boat as a pulpit whence to throw the net of the Gospel
   over His hearers" (Plummer).

   5:4 Had left speaking [epausato lalOn]. He ceased speaking (aorist
   middle indicative and present active participle, regular Greek idiom).
   Put out into the deep [epanagage eis to bathos]. The same double
   compound verb as in verse 3, only here second aorist active imperative
   second person singular. Let down [chalasate]. Peter was master of the
   craft and so he was addressed first. First aorist active imperative
   second person plural. Here the whole crew are addressed. The verb is
   the regular nautical term for lowering cargo or boats (Ac 27:17, 30).
   But it was used for lowering anything from a higher place (Mr 2:4; Ac
   9:25; 2Co 11:33). For a catch [eis agran]. This purpose was the
   startling thing that stirred up Simon.

   5:5 Master [epistata]. Used only by Luke in the N.T. and always in
   addresses to Christ (8:24, 45; 9:33, 49; 17:13). Common in the older
   writers for superintendent or overseer (one standing over another).
   This word recognizes Christ's authority. We toiled [kopiasantes]. This
   verb is from [kopos] [work, toil] and occurs from Aristophanes on. It
   used to be said that the notion of weariness in toil appears only in
   the LXX and the N.T. But Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, pp.
   312f.) cites examples from inscriptions on tombstones quite in harmony
   with the use in the N.T. Peter's protest calls attention also to the
   whole night of fruitless toil. But at thy word [epi de tOi rhemati
   sou]. On the base of [epi]. Acquiescence to show his obedience to
   Christ as "Master," but with no confidence whatsoever in the wisdom of
   this particular command. Besides, fishing in this lake was Peter's
   business and he really claimed superior knowledge on this occasion to
   that of Jesus.

   5:6 They inclosed [sunekleisan]. Effective aorist active indicative
   with perfective compound [sun]. They shut together. Were breaking
   [dieresseto]. Imperfect passive singular [diktua] being neuter plural).
   This is the late form of the old verb [diaregnumi]. The nets were
   actually tearing in two [dia-] and so they would lose all the fish.

   5:7 They beckoned [kateneusan]. Possibly they were too far away for a
   call to be understood. Simon alone had been ordered to put out into the
   deep. So they used signs. Unto their partners [tois metechois]. This
   word [metochos], from [metechO], to have with, means participation with
   one in common blessings (Heb 3:1,14; 6:4; 12:8). While [koinOnos]
   (verse 10 here of James and John also) has the notion of personal
   fellowship, partnership. Both terms are here employed of the two pairs
   of brothers who have a business company under Simon's lead. Help them
   [sullabesthai]. Second aorist middle infinitive. Take hold together
   with and so to help. Paul uses it in Php 4:3. It is an old word that
   was sometimes employed for seizing a prisoner (Lu 22:54) and for
   conception (con-capio) by a woman (Lu 1:24). So that they began to sink
   [hOste buthizesthai auta]. Consecutive use of [hOste] and the
   infinitive (present tense, inchoative use, beginning to sink). An old
   verb from [buthos]. In the N.T. only here and 1Ti 6:9.

   5:8 Fell down at Jesus' knees [prosepesen tois gonasin Iesou]. Just
   like Peter, from extreme self-confidence and pride (verse 5) to abject
   humilation. But his impulse here was right and sincere. His confession
   was true. He was a sinful man.

   5:9 For he was amazed [thambos gar perieschen]. Literally, For a wonder
   held him round. Aorist active indicative. It held Peter fast and all
   the rest.

   5:10 Thou shalt catch men [esei zOgrOn]. Periphrastic future
   indicative, emphasizing the linear idea. The old verb [ZOgreO] means to
   catch alive, not to kill. So then Peter is to be a catcher of men, not
   of fish, and to catch them alive and for life, not dead and for death.
   The great Pentecost will one day prove that Christ's prophecy will come
   true. Much must happen before that great day. But Jesus foresees the
   possibilities in Simon and he joyfully undertakes the task of making a
   fisher of men out of this poor fisher of fish.

   5:11 They left all, and followed him [aphentes panta ekolouthesan].
   Then and there. They had already become his disciples. Now they leave
   their business for active service of Christ. The conduct of this group
   of business men should make other business men to pause and see if
   Jesus is calling them to do likewise.

   5:12 Behold [kai idou]. Quite a Hebraistic idiom, this use of [kai]
   after [egeneto] (almost like [hoti] with [idou] (interjection) and no
   verb. Full of leprosy [pleres lepras]. Mr 1:40 and Mt 8:2 have simply
   "a leper" which see. Evidently a bad case full of sores and far
   advanced as Luke the physician notes. The law (Le 13:12f.) curiously
   treated advanced cases as less unclean than the earlier stages. Fell on
   his face [pesOn epi prosOpon]. Second aorist active participle of
   [piptO], common verb. Mr 1:40 has "kneeling" [gonupetOn] and Mt 8:40
   "worshipped" [prosekunei]. All three attitudes were possible one after
   the other. All three Synoptics quote the identical language of the
   leper and the identical answer of Jesus. His condition of the third
   class turned on the "will" [theleis] of Jesus who at once asserts his
   will [thelO] and cleanses him. All three likewise mention the touch
   [hepsato], verse 13) of Christ's hand on the unclean leper and the
   instantaneous cure.

   5:14 To tell no man [medeni eipein]. This is an indirect command after
   the verb "charged" [pareggeilen]. But Luke changes (constructio
   variata) to the direct quotation, a common idiom in Greek and often in
   Luke (Ac 1:4f.). Here in the direct form he follows Mr 1:43; Mt 8:4.
   See discussion there about the direction to go to the priest to receive
   a certificate showing his cleansing, like our release from quarantine
   (Le 13:39; 14:2-32). For a testimony unto them [eis marturion autois].
   The use of [autois] (them) here is "according to sense," as we say, for
   it has no antecedent in the context, just to people in general. But
   this identical phrase with absence of direct reference occurs in Mark
   and Matthew, pretty good proof of the use of one by the other. Both Mt
   8:4; Lu 5:14 follow Mr 1:44.

   5:15 So much the more [mallon]. Mr 1:45 has only "much" [polla], many),
   but Mark tells more about the effect of this disobedience. Went abroad
   [diercheto]. Imperfect tense. The fame of Jesus kept going. Came
   together [sunerchonto]. Imperfect tense again. The more the report
   spread, the more the crowds came.

   5:16 But he withdrew himself in the deserts and prayed [autos de en
   hupochOrOn en tais eremois kai proseuchomenos]. Periphrastic
   imperfects. Literally, "But he himself was with drawing in the desert
   places and praying." The more the crowds came as a result of the
   leper's story, the more Jesus turned away from them to the desert
   regions and prayed with the Father. It is a picture of Jesus drawn with
   vivid power. The wild enthusiasm of the crowds was running ahead of
   their comprehension of Christ and his mission and message. [HupochOreO]
   (perhaps with the notion of slipping away secretly, [hupo-] is a very
   common Greek verb, but in the N.T. occurs in Luke alone. Elsewhere in
   the N.T. [anachOreO] (to go back) appears.

   5:17 That [kai]. Use of [kai] = [hoti] (that) like the Hebrew wav,
   though found in Greek also. He [autos]. Luke sometimes has [autos] in
   the nominative as unemphatic "he" as here, not "he himself." Was
   teaching [en didaskOn]. Periphrastic imperfect again like our English
   idiom. Were sitting by [esan kathemenoi]. Periphrastic imperfect again.
   There is no "by" in the Greek. Doctors of the law [nomodidaskaloi]. A
   compound word formed after analogy of [hierodidaskalos], but not found
   outside of the N.T. and ecclesiastical writers, one of the very few
   words apparently N.T. in usage. It appears here and Ac 5:34; 1Ti 1:7.
   It is not likely that Luke and Paul made the word, but they simply used
   the term already in current use to describe teachers and interpreters
   of the law. Our word "doctor" is Latin for "teacher." These "teachers
   of the law" are called elsewhere in the Gospels "scribes" [grammateis]
   as in Matthew and Mark (see on Mt 5:20; 23:34) and Lu 5:21; 19:47;
   21:1; 22:2. Luke also employs [nomikos] (one skilled in the law,
   [nomos] as in 10:25. One thinks of our LL.D. (Doctors of Civil and
   Canon Law), for both were combined in Jewish law. They were usually
   Pharisees (mentioned here for the first time in Luke) for which see on
   Mt 3:7,20). Luke will often speak of the Pharisees hereafter. Not all
   the "Pharisees" were "teachers of the law" so that both terms often
   occur together as in verse 21 where Luke has separate articles [hoi
   grammateis kai hoi Pharisaioi], distinguishing between them, though one
   article may occur as in Mt 5:20 or no article as here in verse 17. Luke
   alone mentions the presence here of these Pharisees and doctors of the
   law "which were come" [hoi esan eleluthotes], periphrastic past perfect
   active, had come). Out of every village of Galilee and Judea and
   Jerusalem [ek pases kOmes tes Galilaias kai Ioudaias kai Ierousalem].
   Edersheim (Jewish Social Life) observes that the Jews distinguished
   Jerusalem as a separate district in Judea. Plummer considers it
   hyperbole in Luke to use "every village." But one must recall that
   Jesus had already made one tour of Galilee which stirred the Pharisees
   and rabbis to active opposition. Judea had already been aroused and
   Jerusalem was the headquarters of the definite campaign now organized
   against Jesus. One must bear in mind that Joh 4:1-4 shows that Jesus
   had already left Jerusalem and Judea because of the jealousy of the
   Pharisees. They are here on purpose to find fault and to make charges
   against Jesus. One must not forget that there were many kinds of
   Pharisees and that not all of them were as bad as these legalistic and
   punctilious hypocrites who deserved the indictment and exposure of
   Christ in Mt 23. Paul himself is a specimen of the finer type of
   Pharisee which, however, developed into the persecuting fanatic till
   Jesus changed his whole life. The power of the Lord was with him to
   heal [dunamis Kuriou en eis to iasthai auton]. So the best texts. It is
   neat Greek, but awkward English: "Then was the power of the Lord for
   the healing as to him (Jesus)." Here [Kuriou] refers to Jehovah.
   Dunamis (dynamite) is one of the common words for "miracles"
   [dunameis]. What Luke means is that Jesus had the power of the Lord God
   to heal with. He does not mean that this power was intermittent. He
   simply calls attention to its presence with Jesus on this occasion.

   5:18 That was palsied [hos en paralelumenos]. Periphrastic past perfect
   passive where Mr 2:3; Mt 9:2 have [paralutikon] (our paralytic). Luke's
   phrase is the technical medical term (Hippocrates, Galen, etc.) rather
   than Mark's vernacular word (Ramsay, Luke the Physician, pp. 57f.).
   They sought [ezetoun]. Conative imperfect.

   5:19 By what way they might bring him in [poias eis enegkOsin auton].
   Deliberative subjunctive of the direct question retained in the
   indirect. The housetop [to dOma]. Very old word. The flat roof of
   Jewish houses was usually reached by outside stairway. Cf. Ac 10:9
   where Peter went for meditation. Through the tiles [dia tOn keramOn].
   Common and old word for the tile roof. Mr 2:4 speaks of digging a hole
   in this tile roof. Let him down [kathekan auton]. First aorist (k
   aorist) effective active of [kathiemi], common verb. Mr 2:4 has
   historical present [chalOsi], the verb used by Jesus to Peter and in
   Peter's reply (Lu 5:4f.). With his couch [sun tOi klinidiOi]. Also in
   verse 24. Diminutive of [kline] (verse 18) occurring in Plutarch and
   Koine writers. Mr 2:4 has [krabatton] (pallet). It doubtless was a
   pallet on which the paralytic lay. Into the midst before Jesus [eis to
   meson emprosthen tou Iesou]. The four friends had succeeded, probably
   each holding a rope to a corner of the pallet. It was a moment of
   triumph over difficulties and surprise to all in the house (Peter's
   apparently, Mr 2:1).

   5:20 Their faith [ten pistin autOn]. In all three Gospels. Man
   [anthrOpe]. Mark and Matthew have "child" or "Son" [teknon]. Are
   forgiven [apheOntai]. This Doric form of the perfect passive indicative
   is for the Attic [apheintai]. It appears also in Lu 5:23; 7:47,48; Joh
   20:23; 1Jo 2:12. Mr 2:6; Mt 9:2 have the present passive [aphientai].
   Possibly this man's malady was due to his sin as is sometimes true (Joh
   5:14). The man had faith along with that of the four, but he was still
   a paralytic when Jesus forgave his sins.

   5:21 But God alone [ei me monos ho theos]. Mark has [heis] (one)
   instead of [monos] (alone).

   5:22 Perceiving [epignous]. Same form (second aorist active participle
   of [epiginOskO], common verb for knowing fully) in Mr 2:8. Reason ye
   [dialogizesthe] as in Mr 2:8. Mt 9:4 has [enthumeisthe].

   5:24 He saith unto him that was palsied [eipen tOi paralelumenOi]. This
   same parenthesis right in the midst of the words of Jesus is in Mr
   2:11; Mt 9:6, conclusive proof of interrelation between these
   documents. The words of Jesus are quoted practically alike in all three
   Gospels, the same purpose also [hina eidete] (second perfect active
   subjunctive).

   5:25 Whereon he lay [eph' ho katekeito]. Imperfect, upon which he had
   been lying down. Luke uses this phrase instead of repeating [klinidion]
   (verse 24). Glorifying God [doxazOn ton theon]. As one can well
   imagine.

   5:26 Amazement [ekstasis]. Something out of its place, as the mind.
   Here the people were almost beside themselves as we say with the same
   idiom. See on Mr 5:42. So they kept glorifying God (imperfect tense,
   [edoxazon] and at the same time "were filled with fear" [eplesthesan
   phobou], aorist passive). Strange things [paradoxa]. Our very word
   paradox, contrary to [para] received opinion [doxa]. Plato, Xenophon,
   and Polybius use it. Here alone in the N.T.

   5:27 A publican named Levi [telOnen onomati Leuein]. Mr 2:13 has also
   "The son of Alphaeus" while Mt 9:9 calls him "Matthew." He had, of
   course, both names. All three use the same words [epi to telOnion] for
   the place of toll. See discussion of publican [telOnes] on Mt 9:9. All
   three Gospels give the command of Jesus, Follow me [akolouthei].

   5:28 He forsook all [katalipOn panta]. This detail in Luke alone. He
   left his profitable business for the service of Christ. Followed him
   [ekolouthei autOi]. Imperfect active, perhaps inchoative. He began at
   once to follow him and he kept it up. Both Mr 2:14; Mt 9:9 have the
   aorist [ekolouthesen], perhaps ingressive.

   5:29 A great feast [dochen megalen]. Here and in Lu 14:13 only in the
   N.T. The word [doche], from [dechomai], means reception. Occurs in
   Plutarch and LXX. Levi made Jesus a big reception. Publicans and others
   [telOnOn kai allOn]. Luke declines here to use "sinners" like Mr 2:15
   and Mt 9:10 though he does so in verse 30 and in 15:1. None but social
   outcasts would eat with publicans at such a feast or barbecue, for it
   was a very large affair. Were sitting at meat with them [esan met'
   autOn katakeimenoi]. Literally, were reclining with them (Jesus and the
   disciples). It was a motley crew that Levi had brought together, but he
   showed courage as well as loyalty to Jesus.

   5:30 The Pharisees and their scribes [hoi Pharisaioi kai hoi grammateis
   autOn]. Note article with each substantive and the order, not "scribes
   and Pharisees," but "the Pharisees and the scribes of them" (the
   Pharisees). Some manuscripts omit "their," but Mr 2:16 (the scribes of
   the Pharisees) shows that it is correct here. Some of the scribes were
   Sadducees. It is only the Pharisees who find fault here. Murmured
   [egogguzon]. Imperfect active. Picturesque onomatopoetic word that
   sounds like its meaning. A late word used of the cooing of doves. It is
   like the buzzing of bees, like [tonthorruzO] of literary Greek. They
   were not invited to this feast and would not have come if they had
   been. But, not being invited, they hang on the outside and criticize
   the disciples of Jesus for being there. The crowd was so large that the
   feast may have been served out in the open court at Levi's house, a
   sort of reclining garden party. The publicans and sinners [tOn telOnOn
   kai hamartOlOn]. Here Luke is quoting the criticism of the critics.
   Note one article making one group of all of them.

   5:31 They that are whole [hoi hugiainontes]. Old Greek word for good
   health from [hugies], sound in body. So also in Lu 7:10; 15:27; 3Jo
   1:2. This is the usual word for good health used by Greek medical
   writers. Mr 2:17; Mt 9:12 have [hoi ischuontes] (those who have
   strength).

   5:32 To repentance [eis metanoian]. Alone in Luke not genuine in Mr
   2:17; Mt 9:12. Only sinners would need a call to repentance, a change
   of mind and life. For the moment Jesus accepts the Pharisaic division
   between "righteous" and "sinners" to score them and to answer their
   criticism. At the other times he will show that they only pretend to be
   "righteous" and are "hypocrites" in reality. But Jesus has here blazed
   the path for all soul-winners. The self-satisfied are the hard ones to
   win and they often resent efforts to win them to Christ.

   5:33 Often [pukna]. Only in Luke. Common word for thick, compact,
   often. And make supplications [kai deeseis poiountai]. Only in Luke.
   But thine [hoi de soi]. Sharp contrast between the conduct of the
   disciples of Jesus and those of John and the Pharisees who here appear
   together as critics of Christ and his disciples (Mr 2:18; Mt 9:14),
   though Luke does not bring that out sharply. It is probable that Levi
   had his reception for Jesus on one of the Jewish fast days and, if so,
   this would give special edge to their criticism.

   5:34 Can ye [me dunasthe]. So Luke, adding make, [poiesai], where Mark
   and Matthew have [me dunantai]. All three have [me] and expect the
   answer no.

   5:35 Then in those days [tote en ekeinais tais hemerais]. Here Mr 2:20
   has "then in that day," and Mt 9:15 only "then."

   5:36 Also a parable [kai parabolen]. There are three parables here in
   the answer of Jesus (the bridegroom, the patch on the garment, the
   wineskin). They are not called parables save here, but they are
   parables and Luke's language means that. Rendeth [schisas]. This in
   Luke alone. Common verb. Used of splitting rocks (Mt 27:51. Our word
   schism comes from it. Putteth it [epiballei]. So Mt 9:16 when Mr 2:21
   has [epiraptei] (sews on). The word for "piece" or "patch" [epiblema]
   in all the three Gospels is from the verb [epiballO], to clap on, and
   is in Plutarch, Arrian, LXX, though the verb is as old as Homer. See on
   Matthew and Mark for distinction between [kainos] (fresh), [neos]
   (new), and [palaios] (old). He will rend the new [kai to kainon
   schisei]. Future active indicative. So the best MSS. Will not agree [ou
   sumphOnesei]. Future active indicative. So the best manuscripts again.
   With the old [tOi palaiOi]. Associative instrumental case. Instead of
   this phrase in Luke, Mr 2:21; Mt 9:16 have "a worse rent" [cheiron
   schisma].

   5:38 Must be put [bleteon]. This verbal adjective in [-teos] rather
   than [-tos] appears here alone in the N.T. though it is common enough
   in Attic Greek. It is a survival of the literary style. This is the
   impersonal use and is transitive in sense here and governs the
   accusative "new wine" [oinon neon], though the agent is not expressed
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1097).

   5:39 The old is good [Ho palaios chrestos estin]. So the best MSS.
   rather that [chrestoteros], comparative (better). Westcott and Hort
   wrongly bracket the whole verse, though occurring in Aleph, B C L and
   most of the old documents. It is absent in D and some of the old Latin
   MSS. It is the philosophy of the obscurantist, that is here pictured by
   Christ. "The prejudiced person will not even try the new, or admit that
   it has any merits. He knows that the old is pleasant, and suits him;
   and that is enough; he is not going to change" (Plummer). This is
   Christ's picture of the reactionary Pharisees.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 6

   6:1 On a sabbath [en sabbatOi]. This is the second sabbath on which
   Jesus is noted by Luke. The first was Lu 4:31-41. There was another in
   Joh 5:1-47. There is Western and Syrian (Byzantine) evidence for a very
   curious reading here which calls this sabbath "secondfirst"
   [deuteroprOtOi]. It is undoubtedly spurious, though Westcott and Hort
   print it in the margin. A possible explanation is that a scribe wrote
   "first" [prOtOi] on the margin because of the sabbath miracle in Lu
   6:6-11. Then another scribe recalled Lu 4:31 where a sabbath is
   mentioned and wrote "second" [deuterOi] also on the margin. Finally a
   third scribe combined the two in the word [deuteroprOtOi] that is not
   found elsewhere. If it were genuine, we should not know what it means.
   Plucked [etillon]. Imperfect active. They were plucking as they went on
   through [diaporeuesthai]. Whether wheat or barley, we do not know, not
   our "corn" (maize). Did eat [esthion]. Imperfect again. See on Mt
   12:1f.; Mr 2:23f. for the separate acts in supposed violence of the
   sabbath laws. Rubbing them in their hands [psOchontes tais chersin].
   Only in Luke and only here in the N.T. This was one of the chief
   offences. "According to Rabbinical notions, it was reaping, threshing,
   winnowing, and preparing food all at once" (Plummer). These Pharisees
   were straining out gnats and swallowing camels! This verb [psOchO] is a
   late one for [psaO], to rub.

   6:3 Not even this [oude touto]. This small point only in Luke. What
   [ho]. Literally, which. Mr 2:25; Mt 12:3 have [ti] (what).

   6:4 Did take [labOn]. Second aorist active participle of [lambanO]. Not
   in Mark and Matthew. See Mt 12:1-8; Mr 2:23-28 for discussion of
   details about the shewbread and the five arguments in defence of his
   conduct on the sabbath (example of David, work of the priests on the
   sabbath, prophecy of Ho 6:6, purpose of the sabbath for man, the Son of
   Man lord of the sabbath). It was an overwhelming and crushing reply to
   these pettifogging ceremonialists to which they could not reply, but
   which increased their anger. Codex D transfers verse 5 to after verse
   10 and puts here the following: "On the same day beholding one working
   on the sabbath he said to him: Man, if you know what you are doing,
   happy are you; but if you do not know, cursed are you and a
   transgressor of the law."

   6:6 On another sabbath [en heterOi sabbatOi]. This was a second
   [heteron], as it often means), but not necessarily the next, sabbath.
   This incident is given by all three synoptics (Mr 3:1-6; Mt 12:9-14; Lu
   6:6-11. See Matt. and Mark for details. Only Luke notes that it was on
   a sabbath. Was this because Luke as a physician had to meet this
   problem in his own practise? Right hand [he dexia]. This alone in Luke,
   the physician's eye for particulars.

   6:7 The scribes and the Pharisees [hoi grammateis kai hoi Pharisaioi].
   Only Luke here though Pharisees named in Mt 12:14 and Pharisees and
   Herodians in Mr 3:6. Watched him [pareterounto auton]. Imperfect
   middle, were watching for themselves on the side [para]. Mr 3:2 has the
   imperfect active [pareteroun]. Common verb, but the proposition [para]
   gave an extra touch, watching either assiduously like the physician at
   the bedside or insidiously with evil intent as here. Would heal
   [therapeusei]. But the present active indicative [therapeuei] may be
   the correct text here. So Westcott and Hort. That they might find out
   how to accuse him [hina heurOsin kategorein autou]. Second aorist
   active subjunctive of [heuriskO] and the infinitive with it means to
   find out how to do a thing. They were determined to make a case against
   Jesus. They felt sure that their presence would prevent any spurious
   work on the part of Jesus.

   6:8 But he knew their thoughts [autos de eidei tous dialogismous
   autOn]. In Luke alone. Imperfect in sense, second past perfect in form
   [eidei] from [oida]. Jesus, in contrast to these spies (Plummer), read
   their intellectual processes like an open book. His hand withered
   [xeran ten cheira]. Predicate position of the adjective. So in Mr 3:3.
   Stand forth [stethi]. Luke alone has this verb, second aorist active
   imperative. Mr 3:3 has Arise into the midst [egeire eis to meson]. Luke
   has Arise and step forth into the midst [egeire kai stethi eis to
   meson]. Christ worked right out in the open where all could see. It was
   a moment of excitement when the man stepped forth [este] there before
   them all.

   6:9 I ask you [eperOtO humas]. They had questions in their hearts about
   Jesus. He now asks in addition [ep'] an open question that brings the
   whole issue into the open. A life [psuchen]. So the Revised Version.
   The rabbis had a rule: Periculum vitae pellit sabbatum.But it had to be
   a Jew whose life was in peril on the sabbath. The words of Jesus cut to
   the quick. Or to destroy it [e apolesai]. On this very day these
   Pharisees were plotting to destroy Jesus (verse 7).

   6:10 He looked round about on them all [periblepsamenos]. First aorist
   middle participle as in Mr 3:5, the middle voice giving a personal
   touch to it all. Mark adds "with anger" which Luke here does not put
   in. All three Gospels have the identical command: Stretch forth thy
   hand [exteinon ten cheira sou]. First aorist active imperative. Stretch
   out, clean out, full length. All three Gospels also have the first
   aorist passive indicative [apekatestathe] with the double augment of
   the double compound verb [apokathistemi]. As in Greek writers, so here
   the double compound means complete restoration to the former state.

   6:11 They were filled with madness [eplesthesan anoias] First aorist
   passive (effective) with genitive: In 5:26 we saw the people filled
   with fear. Here is rage that is kin to insanity, for [anoias] is lack
   of sense [a] privative and [nous], mind). An old word, but only here
   and 2Ti 3:9 in the N.T. Communed [dielaloun], imperfect active,
   picturing their excited counsellings with one another. Mr 3:6 notes
   that they bolted out of the synagogue and outside plotted even with the
   Herodians how to destroy Jesus, strange co-conspirators these against
   the common enemy. What they might do to Jesus [ti an poiesaien Iesou].
   Luke puts it in a less damaging way than Mr 3:6; Mt 12:14. This aorist
   optative with [an] is the deliberative question like that in Ac 17:18
   retained in the indirect form here. Perhaps Luke means, not that they
   were undecided about killing Jesus, but only as to the best way of
   doing it. Already nearly two years before the end we see the set
   determination to destroy Jesus. We see it here in Galilee. We have
   already seen it at the feast in Jerusalem (Joh 5:18) where "the Jews
   sought the more to kill him." John and the Synoptics are in perfect
   agreement as to the Pharisaic attitude toward Jesus.

   6:12 He went out into the mountains to pray [exelthein auton eis to
   oros proseuxasthai]. Note [ex-] where Mr 3:13 has goeth up [anabainei].
   Luke alone has "to pray" as he so often notes the habit of prayer in
   Jesus. He continued all night [en dianuktereuOn]. Periphrastic
   imperfect active. Here alone in the N.T., but common in the LXX and in
   late Greek writers. Medical writers used it of whole night vigils. In
   prayer to God [en tei proseuchei tou theou]. Objective genitive [tou
   theou]. This phrase occurs nowhere else. [Proseuche] does not mean
   "place of prayer" or synagogue as in Ac 16:13, but the actual prayer of
   Jesus to the Father all night long. He needed the Father's guidance now
   in the choice of the Apostles in the morning.

   6:13 When it was day [hote egeneto hemera]. When day came, after the
   long night of prayer. He chose from them twelve [eklexamenos ap' autOn
   dOdeka]. The same root [leg] was used for picking out, selecting and
   then for saying. There was a large group of "disciples" or "learners"
   whom he "called" to him [prosephOnesen], and from among whom he chose
   (of himself, and for himself, indirect middle voice [eklexamenos]. It
   was a crisis in the work of Christ. Jesus assumed full responsibility
   even for the choice of Judas who was not forced upon Jesus by the rest
   of the Twelve. "You did not choose me, but I chose you," (Joh 15:16)
   where Jesus uses [exelexasthe] and [exelexamen] as here by Luke. Whom
   also he named apostles [hous kai apostolous Onomasen]. So then Jesus
   gave the twelve chosen disciples this appellation. Aleph and B have
   these same words in Mr 3:14 besides the support of a few of the best
   cursives, the Bohairic Coptic Version and the Greek margin of the
   Harclean Syriac. Westcott and Hort print them in their text in Mr 3:14,
   but it remains doubtful whether they were not brought into Mark from Lu
   6:13 where they are undoubtedly genuine. See Mt 10:2 where the
   connection with sending them out by twos in the third tour of Galilee.
   The word is derived from [apostellO], to send (Latin, mitto) and
   apostle is missionary, one sent. Jesus applies the term to himself
   [apesteilas], Joh 17:3) as does Heb 3:1. The word is applied to others,
   like Barnabas, besides these twelve including the Apostle Paul who is
   on a par with them in rank and authority, and even to mere messengers
   of the churches (2Co 8:23). But these twelve apostles stand apart from
   all others in that they were all chosen at once by Jesus himself "that
   they might be with him" (Mr 3:14), to be trained by Jesus himself and
   to interpret him and his message to the world. In the nature of the
   case they could have no successors as they had to be personal witnesses
   to the life and resurrection of Jesus (Ac 1:22). The selection of
   Matthias to succeed Judas cannot be called a mistake, but it
   automatically ceased. For discussion of the names and groups in the
   list see discussion on Mt 10:1-4; Mr 3:14-19.

   6:16 Which was the traitor [hos egeneto prodotes]. Who became traitor,
   more exactly, [egeneto], not [en]. He gave no signs of treachery when
   chosen.

   6:17 He came down with them [katabas met' autOn]. Second aorist active
   participle of [katabainO], common verb. This was the night of prayer up
   in the mountain (Mr 31:3; Lu 6:12) and the choice of the Twelve next
   morning. The going up into the mountain of Mt 5:1 may simply be a
   summary statement with no mention of what Luke has explained or may be
   a reference to the elevation, where he "sat down" (Mt 5:1), above the
   plain or "level place" [epi topou pedinou] on the mountain side where
   Jesus "stood" or "stopped" [este]. It may be a level place towards the
   foot of the mountain. He stopped his descent at this level place and
   then found a slight elevation on the mountain side and began to speak.
   There is not the slightest reason for making Matthew locate this sermon
   on the mountain and Luke in the valley as if the places, audiences, and
   topics were different. For the unity of the sermon see discussion on Mt
   5:1f. The reports in Matthew and Luke begin alike, cover the same
   general ground and end alike. The report in Matthew is longer chiefly
   because in Chapter 5, he gives the argument showing the contrast
   between Christ's conception of righteousness and that of the Jewish
   rabbis. Undoubtedly, Jesus repeated many of the crisp sayings here at
   other times as in Luke 12, but it is quite gratuitous to argue that
   Matthew and Luke have made up this sermon out of isolated sayings of
   Christ at various times. Both Matthew and Luke give too much that is
   local of place and audience for that idea. Mt 5:1 speaks of "the
   multitudes" and "his disciples." Lu 6:17 notes "a great multitude of
   his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and
   Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon." They agree in the
   presence of disciples and crowds besides the disciples from whom the
   twelve apostles were chosen. It is important to note how already people
   were coming from "the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon" "to hear him and to
   be healed [iathenai], first aorist passive of [iaomai] of their
   diseases."

   6:18 With unclean spirits [apo pneumatOn akathartOn]. In an amphibolous
   position for it can be construed with "troubled," (present passive
   participle [enochloumenoi] or with "were healed" (imperfect passive,
   [etherapeuonto]. The healings were repeated as often as they came. Note
   here both verbs, [iaomai] and [therapeuO], used of the miraculous cures
   of Jesus. [TherapeuO] is the verb more commonly employed of regular
   professional cures, but no such distinction is made here.

   6:19 Sought to touch him [ezetoun haptesthai autou]. Imperfect active.
   One can see the surging, eager crowd pressing up to Jesus. Probably
   some of them felt that there was a sort of virtue or magic in touching
   his garments like the poor woman in Lu 8:43f. (Mr 5:23; Mt 9:21. For
   power came forth from him [hoti dunamis par' autou exercheto].
   Imperfect middle, power was coming out from him. This is the reason for
   the continual approach to Jesus. And healed them all [kai iato pantas].
   Imperfect middle again. Was healing all, kept on healing all. The
   preacher today who is not a vehicle of power from Christ to men may
   well question why that is true. Undoubtedly the failure to get a
   blessing is one reason why many people stop going to church. One may
   turn to Paul's tremendous words in Php 4:13: "I have strength for all
   things in him who keeps on pouring power into me" [panta ischuO en tOi
   endunamounti me]. It was at a time of surpassing dynamic spiritual
   energy when Jesus delivered this greatest of all sermons so far as they
   are reported to us. The very air was electric with spiritual power.
   There are such times as all preachers know.

   6:20 And he lifted up his eyes [kai autos eparas tous opthalmous
   autou]. First aorist active participle from [epairO]. Note also Luke's
   favourite use of [kai autos] in beginning a paragraph. Vivid detail
   alone in Luke. Jesus looked the vast audience full in the face. Mt 5:2
   mentions that "he opened his mouth and taught them" (began to teach
   them, inchoative imperfect, [edidasken]. He spoke out so that the great
   crowd could hear. Some preachers do not open their mouths and do not
   look up at the people, but down at the manuscript and drawl along while
   the people lose interest and even go to sleep or slip out. Ye poor [hoi
   ptOchoi]. The poor, but "yours" [humetera] justifies the translation
   "ye." Luke's report is direct address in all the four beatitudes and
   four woes given by him. It is useless to speculate why Luke gives only
   four of the eight beatitudes in Matthew or why Matthew does not give
   the four woes in Luke. One can only say that neither professes to give
   a complete report of the sermon. There is no evidence to show that
   either saw the report of the other. They may have used a common source
   like Q (the Logia of Jesus) or they may have had separate sources.
   Luke's first beatitude corresponds with Matthew's first, but he does
   not have "in spirit" after "poor." Does Luke represent Jesus as saying
   that poverty itself is a blessing? It can be made so. Or does Luke
   represent Jesus as meaning what is in Matthew, poverty of spirit? The
   kingdom of God [he basileia tou theou]. Mt 5:3 has "the kingdom of
   heaven" which occurs alone in Matthew though he also has the one here
   in Luke with no practical difference. The rabbis usually said "the
   kingdom of heaven." They used it of the political Messianic kingdom
   when Judaism of the Pharisaic sort would triumph over the world. The
   idea of Jesus is in the sharpest contrast to that conception here and
   always. See on Mt 3:2 for discussion of the meaning of the word
   "kingdom." It is the favourite word of Jesus for the rule of God in the
   heart here and now. It is both present and future and will reach a
   glorious consummation. Some of the sayings of Christ have apocalyptic
   and eschatological figures, but the heart of the matter is here in the
   spiritual reality of the reign of God in the hearts of those who serve
   him. The kingdom parables expand and enlarge upon various phases of
   this inward life and growth.

   6:21 Now [nun]. Luke adds this adverb here and in the next sentence
   after "weep." This sharpens the contrast between present sufferings and
   the future blessings. Filled [chortasthesesthe]. Future passive
   indicative. The same verb in Mt 5:6. Originally it was used for giving
   fodder [chortos] to animals, but here it is spiritual fodder or food
   except in Lu 15:16; 16:21. Luke here omits "and thirst after
   righteousness." Weep [klaiontes]. Audible weeping. Where Mt 5:4 has
   "mourn" [penthountes]. Shall laugh [gelasete]. Here Mt 5:4 has "shall
   be comforted." Luke's words are terse.

   6:22 When they shall separate you [hotan aphorisOsin humas]. First
   aorist active subjunctive, from [aphorizO], common verb for marking off
   a boundary. So either in good sense or bad sense as here. The reference
   is to excommunication from the congregation as well as from social
   intercourse. Cast out your name as evil [exbalOsin to onoma humOn hOs
   poneron]. Second aorist active subjunctive of [ekballO], common verb.
   The verb is used in Aristophanes, Sophocles, and Plato of hissing an
   actor off the stage. The name of Christian or disciple or Nazarene came
   to be a byword of contempt as shown in the Acts. It was even unlawful
   in the Neronian persecution when Christianity was not a religio
   licita.For the Son of man's sake [heneka tou huiou tou anthrOpou].
   Jesus foretold what will befall those who are loyal to him. The Acts of
   the Apostles is a commentary on this prophecy. This is Christ's common
   designation of himself, never of others save by Stephen (Ac 7:56) and
   in the Apocalypse (Re 1:13; 14:14). But both Son of God and Son of man
   apply to him (Joh 1:50,52; Mt 26:63f.). Christ was a real man though
   the Son of God. He is also the representative man and has authority
   over all men.

   6:23 Leap for joy [skirtesate]. Old verb and in LXX, but only in Luke
   in the N.T. (here and 1:41, 44). It answers to Matthew's (Mt 5:12) "be
   exceeding glad." Did [epoioun]. Imperfect active, the habit of "their
   fathers" (peculiar to both here). Mt 5:12 has "persecuted." Thus they
   will receive a prophet's reward (Mt 1:41.

   6:24 But woe unto you that are rich [Plen ouai humin tois plousiois].
   Sharp contrast [plen]. As a matter of fact the rich Pharisees and
   Sadducees were the chief opposers of Christ as of the early disciples
   later (Jas 5:1-6). Ye have received [apechete]. Receipt in full
   [apechO] means as the papyri show. Consolation [paraklesin]. From
   [parakaleO], to call to one's side, to encourage, to help, to cheer.

   6:25 Now [nun]. Here twice as in verse 21 in contrast with future
   punishment. The joys and sorrows in these two verses are turned round,
   measure for measure reversed. The Rich Man and Lazarus (Lu 16:19-31)
   illustrate these contrasts in the present and the future.

   6:26 In the same manner did their fathers [ta auta epoioun hoi pateres
   autOn]. Literally, their fathers did the same things to the false
   prophets. That is they spoke well [kalOs], finely of false prophets.
   Praise is sweet to the preacher but all sorts of preachers get it. Of
   you [humas]. Accusative case after words of speaking according to
   regular Greek idiom, to speak one fair, to speak well of one.

   6:27 But I say unto you that hear [Alla humin legO tois akouousin].
   There is a contrast in this use of [alla] like that in Mt 5:44. This is
   the only one of the many examples given by Mt 5 of the sharp antithesis
   between what the rabbis taught and what Jesus said. Perhaps that
   contrast is referred to by Luke. If necessary, [alla] could be
   coordinating or paratactic conjunction as in 2Co 7:11 rather than
   adversative as apparently here. See Mt 5:43f. Love of enemies is in the
   O.T., but Jesus ennobles the word, [agapaO], and uses it of love for
   one's enemies.

   6:28 That despitefully use you [tOn epereazontOn humas]. This old verb
   occurs here only in the N.T. and in 1Pe 3:16, not being genuine in Mt
   5:44.

   6:29 On the cheek [epi ten siagona]. Mt 5:39 has "right." Old word
   meaning jaw or jawbone, but in the N.T. only here and Mt 5:39, which
   see for discussion. It seems an act of violence rather than contempt.
   Sticklers for extreme literalism find trouble with the conduct of Jesus
   in Joh 18:22f. where Jesus, on receiving a slap in the face, protested
   against it. Thy cloke [to himation], thy coat [ton chitOna]. Here the
   upper and more valuable garment [himation] is first taken, the under
   and less valuable [chitOn] last. In Mt 5:40 the process (apparently a
   legal one) is reversed. Withhold not [me kOluseis]. Aorist subjunctive
   in prohibition against committing an act. Do not hinder him in his
   robbing. It is usually useless anyhow with modern armed bandits.

   6:30 Ask them not again [me apaitei]. Here the present active
   imperative in a prohibition, do not have the habit of asking back. This
   common verb only here in the N.T., for [aitousin] is the correct text
   in Lu 12:20). The literary flavour of Luke's Koine style is seen in his
   frequent use of words common in the literary Greek, but appearing
   nowhere else in the N.T.

   6:31 As ye would [kathOs thelete]. In Mt 7:12 the Golden Rule begins:
   [Panta hosa ean thelete]. Luke has "likewise" [homoiOs] where Matthew
   has [houtOs]. See on Matthew for discussion of the saying.

   6:32 What thank have ye? [poia h-min charis estin;]. What grace or
   gratitude is there to you? Mt 5:46 has [misthon] (reward).

   6:33 Do good [agathopoiete]. Third-class condition, [ean] and present
   subjunctive. This verb not in old Greek, but in LXX. Even sinners [kai
   hoi hamartOloi]. Even the sinners, the article distinguishing the
   class. Mt 5:46 has "even the publicans" and 5:47 "even the Gentiles."
   That completes the list of the outcasts for "sinners" includes
   "harlots" and all the rest.

   6:34 If ye lend [ean danisete]. Third-class condition, first aorist
   active subjunctive from [danizO] (old form [daneizO] to lend for
   interest in a business transaction (here in active to lend and Mt 5:42
   middle to borrow and nowhere else in N.T.), whereas [kichremi] (only Lu
   11:5 in N.T.) means to loan as a friendly act. To receive again as much
   [hina apolabOsin ta isa]. Second aorist active subjunctive of
   [apolambanO], old verb, to get back in full like [apechO] in 6:24.
   Literally here, "that they may get back the equal" (principal and
   interest, apparently). It could mean "equivalent services." No parallel
   in Matthew.

   6:35 But [plen]. Plain adversative like [plen] in verse 24. Never
   despairing [meden apelpizontes]. [Meden] is read by A B L Bohairic and
   is the reading of Westcott and Hort. The reading [medena] is translated
   "despairing of no man." The Authorized Version has it "hoping for
   nothing again," a meaning for [apelpizO] with no parallel elsewhere.
   Field (Otium Nor. iii. 40) insists that all the same the context
   demands this meaning because of [apelpizein] in verse 34, but the
   correct reading there is [elpizein], not [apelpizein]. Here Field's
   argument falls to the ground. The word occurs in Polybius, Diodorus,
   LXX with the sense of despairing and that is the meaning here. D and
   Old Latin documents have nihil desperantes, but the Vulgate has nihil
   inde sperantes (hoping for nothing thence) and this false rendering has
   wrought great havoc in Europe. "On the strength of it Popes and
   councils have repeatedly condemned the taking of any interest whatever
   for loans. As loans could not be had without interest, and Christians
   were forbidden to take it, money lending passed into the hands of the
   Jews, and added greatly to the unnatural detestation in which Jews were
   held" (Plummer). By "never despairing" or "giving up nothing in
   despair" Jesus means that we are not to despair about getting the money
   back. We are to help the apparently hopeless cases. Medical writers use
   the word for desperate or hopeless cases. Sons of the Most High [huoi
   Hupsistou]. In 1:32 Jesus is called "Son of the Highest" and here all
   real children or sons of God (Lu 20:36) are so termed. See also 1:35,
   76 for the use of "the Highest" of God. He means the same thing that we
   see in Mt 5:45,48 by "your Father." Toward the unthankful and evil [epi
   tous acharistous kai ponerous]. God the Father is kind towards the
   unkind and wicked. Note the one article with both adjectives.

   6:36 Even as your Father [kathOs ho pater humOn]. In Mt 5:48 we have
   [hOs ho pater humOn]. In both the perfection of the Father is placed as
   the goal before his children. In neither case is it said that they have
   reached it.

   6:37 And judge not [kai me krinete]. [Me] and the present active
   imperative, forbidding the habit of criticism. The common verb [krinO],
   to separate, we have in our English words critic, criticism, criticize,
   discriminate. Jesus does not mean that we are not to form opinions, but
   not to form them rashly, unfairly, like our prejudice. Ye shall not be
   judged [ou me krithete]. First aorist passive subjunctive with double
   negative ou [me], strong negative. Condemn not [me katadikazete]. To
   give judgment [dike, dixazO] against [kata] one. [Me] and present
   imperative. Either cease doing or do not have the habit of doing it.
   Old verb. Ye shall not be condemned [ou me katadikasthete]. First
   aorist passive indicative again with the double negative.
   Censoriousness is a bad habit. Release [apoluete]. Positive command the
   opposite of the censoriousness condemned.

   6:38 Pressed down [pepiesmenon]. Perfect passive participle from
   [piezO], old verb, but here alone in the N.T., though the Doric form
   [piazO], to seize, occurs several times (Joh 7:30,32,44). Shaken
   together [sesaleumenon]. Perfect passive participle again from common
   verb [saleuO]. Running over [huperekchunnomenon]. Present middle
   participle of this double compound verb not found elsewhere save in A Q
   in Joe 2:24. [ChunO] is a late form of [cheO]. There is asyndeton here,
   no conjunction connecting these participles. The present here is in
   contrast to the two preceding perfects. The participles form an
   epexegesis or explanation of the "good measure" [metron kalon]. Into
   your bosom [eis ton kolpon humOn]. The fold of the wide upper garment
   bound by the girdle made a pocket in common use (Ex 4:6; Pr 6:27; Ps
   79:12; Isa 65:6f.; Jer 32:18). So Isa 65:7: I will measure their former
   work unto their bosom. Shall be measured to you again
   [antimetrethesetai]. Future passive indicative of the verb here only in
   the N.T. save late MSS. in Mt 7:2. Even here some MSS. have
   [metrethesetai]. The [anti] has the common meaning of in turn or back,
   measured back to you in requital.

   6:39 Also a parable [kai parabolen]. Plummer thinks that the second
   half of the sermon begins here as indicated by Luke's insertion of "And
   he spake [eipen de] at this point. Luke has the word parable some
   fifteen times both for crisp proverbs and for the longer narrative
   comparisons. This is the only use of the term parable concerning the
   metaphors in the Sermon on the Mount. But in both Matthew and Luke's
   report of the discourse there are some sixteen possible applications of
   the word. Two come right together: The blind leading the blind, the
   mote and the beam. Matthew gives the parabolic proverb of the blind
   leading the blind later (Mt 15:14). Jesus repeated these sayings on
   various occasions as every teacher does his characteristic ideas. So
   Luke 6:40; Mt 10:24, Lu 6:45; Mt 12:34f. Can [Meti dunatai]. The use of
   [meti] in the question shows that a negative answer is expected. Guide
   [hodegein]. Common verb from [hodegos] (guide) and this from [hodos]
   (way) and [hegeomai], to lead or guide. Shall they not both fall?
   [ouchi amphoteroi empesountai;]. [Ouchi], a sharpened negative from
   [ouk], in a question expecting the answer Yes. Future middle indicative
   of the common verb [empiptO]. Into a pit [eis bothunon]. Late word for
   older [bothros].

   6:40 The disciple is not above his master [ouk estin mathetes huper ton
   didaskalon]. Literally, a learner (or pupil) is not above the teacher.
   Precisely so in Mt 10:24 where "slave" is added with "lord." But here
   Luke adds: "But everyone when he is perfected shall be as his master"
   [katertismenos de pas estai hOs ho didaskalos autou]. The state of
   completion, perfect passive participle, is noted in [katertismenos].
   The word is common for mending broken things or nets (Mt 4:21) or men
   (Ga 6:1). So it is a long process to get the pupil patched up to the
   plane of his teacher.

   6:41 Mote [karphos] and beam [dokon]. See on Mt 7:3-5 for discussion of
   these words in this parabolic proverb kin to several of ours today.

   6:42 Canst thou say [dunasai legein]. Here Mt 7:4 has wilt thou say
   [ereis]. Beholdest not [ou blepOn]. Mt 7:4 has "lo" [idou]. Thou
   hypocrite [hupokrita]. Contrast to the studied politeness of "brother"
   [adelphe] above. Powerful picture of blind self-complacence and
   incompetence, the keyword to argument here.

   6:44 Is known [ginOsketai]. The fruit of each tree reveals its actual
   character. It is the final test. This sentence is not in Mt 7:17-20,
   but the same idea is in the repeated saying (Mt 7:16, 20): "By their
   fruits ye shall know them," where the verb epignOsesthe means full
   knowledge. The question in Mt 7:16 is put here in positive declarative
   form. The verb is in the plural for "men" or "people," [sullegousin].
   See on Mt 7:16. Bramble bush [batou]. Old word, quoted from the LXX in
   Mr 12:26; Lu 20:37 (from Ex 3:6) about the burning bush that Moses saw,
   and by Stephen (Ac 7:30,35) referring to the same incident. Nowhere
   else in the N.T. "Galen has a chapter on its medicinal uses, and the
   medical writings abound in prescriptions of which it is an ingredient"
   (Vincent). Gather [trugOsin]. A verb common in Greek writers for
   gathering ripe fruit. In the N.T. only here and Re 14:18f. Grapes
   [staphulen]. Cluster of grapes.

   6:45 Bringeth forth [propherei]. In a similar saying repeated later. Mt
   12:34f. has the verb [ekballei] (throws out, casts out), a bolder
   figure. "When men are natural, heart and mouth act in concert. But
   otherwise the mouth sometimes professes what the heart does not feel"
   (Plummer).

   6:46 And do not [kai ou poieite]. This is the point about every sermon
   that counts. The two parables that follow illustrate this point.

   6:47 Hears and does [akouOn kai poiOn]. Present active participles. So
   in Mt 7:24. (Present indicative.) I will show you [hupodeixO humin].
   Only in Luke, not Matthew.

   6:48 Digged and went deep [eskapsen kai ebathunen]. Two first aorist
   indicatives. Not a hendiadys for dug deep. [SkaptO], to dig, is as old
   as Homer, as is [bathunO], to make deep. And laid a foundation [kai
   etheken themelion]. That is the whole point. This wise builder struck
   the rock before he laid the foundation. When a flood arose [plemmures
   genomenes]. Genitive absolute. Late word for flood, [plemmura], only
   here in the N.T., though in Job 40:18. Brake against [proserexen].
   First aorist active indicative from [prosregnumi] and in late writers
   [prosressO], to break against. Only here in the N.T. Mt 7:25 has
   [prosepesan], from [prospiptO], to fall against. Could not shake it
   [ouk ischusen saleusai auten]. Did not have strength enough to shake
   it. Because it had been well builded [dia to kalOs oikodomesthai
   auten]. Perfect passive articular infinitive after [dia] and with
   accusative of general reference.

   6:49 He that heareth and doeth not [ho de akousas kai me poiesas].
   Aorist active participle with article. Particular case singled out
   (punctiliar, aorist). Like a man [homoios estin anthrOpOi]. Associative
   instrumental case after [homoios] as in verse 47. Upon the earth [epi
   ten gen]. Mt 7:26 has "upon the sand" [epi ten ammon], more precise and
   worse than mere earth. But not on the rock. Without a foundation
   [chOris themeliou]. The foundation on the rock after deep digging as in
   verse 48. It fell in [sunepesen]. Second aorist active of [sunpiptO],
   to fall together, to collapse. An old verb from Homer on, but only here
   in the N.T. The ruin [to regma]. The crash like a giant oak in the
   forest resounded far and wide. An old word for a rent or fracture as in
   medicine for laceration of a wound. Only here in the N.T.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 7

   7:1 After [epeide, epei and de]. This conjunction was written [epei de]
   in Homer and is simple [epei] with the intensive [de] added and even
   [epei de per] once in N.T. (Lu 1:1). This is the only instance of the
   temporal use of [epeide] in the N.T. The causal sense occurs only in
   Luke and Paul, for [epei] is the correct text in Mt 21:46. Had ended
   [eplerOsen]. First aorist active indicative. There is here a reference
   to the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount, but with nothing
   concerning the impression produced by the discourse such as is seen in
   Mt 7:28. This verse really belongs as the conclusion of Chapter 6, not
   as the beginning of Chapter 7. In the ears of the people [eis tas akoas
   tou laou]. [Akoe] from [akouO], to hear, is used of the sense of
   hearing (1Co 12:17), the ear with which one hears (Mr 7:35; Heb 5:11),
   the thing heard or the report (Rom 10:16) or oral instruction (Ga
   3:2,5). Both Mt 8:5-13; Lu 7:1-10 locate the healing of the centurion's
   servant in Capernaum where Jesus was after the Sermon on the Mount.

   7:2 Centurion's servant [Hekatontarchou tinos doulos]. Slave of a
   certain centurion (Latin word [centurio], commander of a century or
   hundred). Mr 15:39,44 has the Latin word in Greek letters, [kenturiOn].
   The centurion commanded a company which varied from fifty to a hundred.
   Each cohort had six centuries. Each legion had ten cohorts or bands (Ac
   10:1). The centurions mentioned in the N.T. all seem to be fine men as
   Polybius states that the best men in the army had this position. See
   also Lu 23:47. The Greek has two forms of the word, both from
   [hekaton], hundred, and [archO], to rule, and they appear to be used
   interchangeably. So we have [hekatontarchos]; here, the form is
   [-archos], and [hekatontarches], the form is [-arches] in verse 6. The
   manuscripts differ about it in almost every instance. The [-archos]
   form is accepted by Westcott and Hort only in the nominative save the
   genitive singular here in Lu 7:2 and the accusative singular in Ac
   22:25. See like variation between them in Mt 8:5,8 [-archos] and Mt
   8:13 [archei]. So also [-archon] (Ac 22:25) and [-arches] (Ac 22:26).
   Dear to him [autOi entimos]. Held in honour, prized, precious, dear (Lu
   14:8; 1Pe 2:4; Php 2:29), common Greek word. Even though a slave he was
   dear to him. Was sick [kakOs echOn]. Having it bad. Common idiom. See
   already Mt 4:24; 8:16; Mr 2:17; Lu 5:31, etc. Mt 8:6 notes that the
   slave was a paralytic. And at the point of death [emellen teleutain].
   Imperfect active of [mellO] (note double augment [e] which is used
   either with the present infinitive as here, the aorist (Re 3:16), or
   even the future because of the future idea in [mellO] (Ac 11:28;
   24:15). He was about to die.

   7:3 Sent unto him elders of the Jews [apesteilen pros auton
   presbouterous tOn IoudaiOn]. Mt 8:5 says "the centurion came unto him."
   For discussion of this famous case of apparent discrepancy see
   discussion on Matthew. One possible solution is that Luke tells the
   story as it happened with the details, whereas Matthew simply presents
   a summary statement without the details. What one does through another
   he does himself. Asking him [erOtOn auton]. Present active participle,
   masculine singular nominative, of the verb [erOtaO] common for asking a
   question as in the old Greek (Lu 22:68). But more frequently in the
   N.T. the verb has the idea of making a request as here. This is not a
   Hebraism or an Aramaism, but is a common meaning of the verb in the
   papyri (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, p. 168). It is to be
   noted here that Luke represents the centurion himself as "asking"
   through the elders of the Jews (leading citizens). In Mt 8:6 the verb
   is [parakalOn] (beseeching). That he would come and save [hopOs elthOn
   diasOsei]. [Hina] is the more common final or sub-final (as here)
   conjunction, but [hopOs] still occurs. [DiasOsei] is effective aorist
   active subjunctive, to bring safe through as in a storm (Ac 28:1,4).
   Common word.

   7:4 Besought [parekaloun]. Imperfect active, began and kept on
   beseeching. This is the same verb used by Matthew in Mt 8:5 of the
   centurion himself. Earnestly [spoudaiOs]. From [spoude] haste. So
   eagerly, earnestly, zealously, for time was short. That thou shouldst
   do this for him [hOi parexei touto]. Second future middle singular of
   [parechO]. Old and common verb, furnish on thy part. [HOi] is relative
   in dative case almost with notion of contemplated result (Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 961).

   7:5 For [gar]. This clause gives the reason why the elders of the Jews
   consider him "worthy" [axios], drawing down the scale, [axis], [ago].
   He was hardly a proselyte, but was a Roman who had shown his love for
   the Jews. Himself [autos]. All by himself and at his own expense. Us
   [hemin]. Dative case, for us. It is held by some archaeologists that
   the black basalt ruins in Tell Hum are the remains of the very
   synagogue [ten sunagOgen]. Literally, the synagogue, the one which we
   have, the one for us.

   7:6 Went with them [eporeueto sun autois]. Imperfect indicative middle.
   He started to go along with them. Now [ede]. Already like Latin jam.In
   1Co 4:8 [nun ede] like jam nunc.Sent friends [epempsen philous]. This
   second embassy also, wanting in Matthew's narrative. He "puts the
   message of both into the mouth of the centurion himself" (Plummer).
   Note saying [legOn], present active singular participle, followed by
   direct quotation from the centurion himself. Trouble not thyself [Me
   skullou]. Present middle (direct use) imperative of [skullO], old verb
   originally meaning to skin, to mangle, and then in later Greek to vex,
   trouble, annoy. Frequent in the papyri in this latter sense. For I am
   not worthy that [ou gar hikanos eimi hina]. The same word [hikanos],
   not [axios], as in Mt 8:8, which see for discussion, from [hikO,
   hikanO], to fit, to reach, be adequate for. [Hina] in both places as
   common in late Greek. See Mt 8:8 also for "roof" [stegen], covering).

   7:7 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee [dio
   oude emauton exiOsa pros se elthein]. Not in Matthew because he
   represents the centurion as coming to Jesus. Speak the word [eipe
   logOi]. As in Mt 8:8. Second aorist active imperative with instrumental
   case, speak with a word. My servant shall be healed [iathetO ho pais
   mou]. Imperative first aorist passive, let be healed. [Pais] literally
   means "boy," an affectionate term for the "slave," [doulos] (verse 2),
   who was "dear" to him.

   7:8 "Set" [tassomenos]. Genuine here, though doubtful in Mt 8:9 where
   see discussion of this vivid and characteristic speech of the
   centurion.

   7:9 Turned [strapheis]. Second aorist passive participle of [strephO],
   to turn. Common verb. A vivid touch not in Matthew's account. In both
   Matthew and Luke Jesus marvels at the great faith of this Roman
   centurion beyond that among the Jews. As a military man he had learned
   how to receive orders and to execute them and hence to expect obedience
   to his commands, He recognized Jesus as Master over disease with power
   to compel obedience.

   7:10 Whole [hugiainonta]. Sound, well. See Lu 5:31.

   7:11 Soon afterwards [en toi hexes]. According to this reading supply
   [chronOi], time. Other MSS. read [tei hexes] (supply [hemerai], day).
   [Hexes] occurs in Luke and Acts in the N.T. though old adverb of time.
   That [Hoti]. Not in the Greek, the two verbs [egeneto] and [eporeuthe]
   having no connective (asyndeton). Went with him [suneporeuonto autOi].
   Imperfect middle picturing the procession of disciples and the crowd
   with Jesus. Nain is not mentioned elsewhere in the N.T. There is today
   a hamlet about two miles west of Endor on the north slope of Little
   Hermon. There is a burying-place still in use. Robinson and Stanley
   think that the very road on which the crowd with Jesus met the funeral
   procession can be identified.

   7:12 Behold [kai idou]. The [kai] introduces the apodosis of the
   temporal sentence and has to be left out in translations. It is a
   common idiom in Luke, [kai idou]. There was carried out [exekomizeto].
   Imperfect passive indicative. Common verb in late Greek for carrying
   out a body for burial, though here only in the N.T. [ekkomizO]. Rock
   tombs outside of the village exist there today. One that was dead
   [tethnekOs]. Perfect active participle of [thneskO], to die. The only
   son of his mother [monogenes huios tei metri auto-]. Only begotten son
   to his mother (dative case). The compound adjective [monogenes] [monos]
   and [genos] is common in the old Greek and occurs in the N.T. about
   Jesus (Joh 3:16,18). The "death of a widow's only son was the greatest
   misfortune conceivable" (Easton). And she was a widow [kai aute en
   chera]. This word [chera] gives the finishing touch to the pathos of
   the situation. The word is from [cheros], bereft. The mourning of a
   widow for an only son is the extremity of grief (Plummer). Much people
   [ochlos hikanos]. Considerable crowd as often with this adjective
   [hikanos]. Some were hired mourners, but the size of the crowd showed
   the real sympathy of the town for her.

   7:13 The Lord saw her [idOn auten ho kurios]. The Lord of Life
   confronts death (Plummer) and Luke may use [Kurios] here purposely. Had
   compassion [esplagchthe]. First aorist (ingressive) passive indicative
   of [splagchnizomai]. Often love and pity are mentioned as the motives
   for Christ's miracles (Mt 14:14; 15:32, etc.). It is confined to the
   Synoptics in the N.T. and about Christ save in the parables by Christ.
   Weep not [me klaie]. Present imperative in a prohibition. Cease
   weeping.

   7:14 Touched the bier [hepsato tou sorou]. An urn for the bones or
   ashes of the dead in Homer, then the coffin (Ge 5:26), then the funeral
   couch or bier as here. Only here in the N.T. Jesus touched the bier to
   make the bearers stop, which they did (stood still, [estesan], second
   aorist active indicative of [histemi].

   7:15 Sat up [anekathisen]. First aorist active indicative. The verb in
   the N.T. only here and Ac 9:40). Medical writers often used it of the
   sick sitting up in bed (Hobart, Med. Lang. of St. Luke, p. 11). It is
   objected that the symmetry of these cases (daughter of Jairus raised
   from the death-bed, this widow's son raised from the bier, Lazarus
   raised from the tomb) is suspicious, but no one Gospel gives all three
   (Plummer). Gave him to his mother [edOken auton tei metri autou].
   Tender way of putting it. "For he had already ceased to belong to his
   mother" (Bengel). So in Lu 9:42.

   7:16 Fear seized all [elaben de phobos pantas]. Aorist active
   indicative. At once. They glorified God [edoxazon ton theon]. Imperfect
   active, inchoative, began and increased.

   7:17 This report [ho logos houtos]. That God had raised up a great
   prophet who had shown his call by raising the dead.

   7:18 And the disciples of John told him [kai apeggeilan IOanei hoi
   mathetai autou]. Literally, and his disciples announced to John. Such
   news (verse 17) was bound to come to the ears of the Baptist
   languishing in the dungeon of Machaerus (Lu 3:20). Lu 7:18-35 runs
   parallel with Mt 11:2-19, a specimen of Q, the non-Marcan portion of
   Matthew and Luke.

   7:19 Calling unto him [proskalesamenos]. First aorist middle (indirect)
   participle. Two [duo tinas]. Certain two. Not in Mt 11:2. Saying
   [legOn]. John saying by the two messengers. The message is given
   precisely alike in Mt 11:3, which see. In both we have [heteron] for
   "another," either a second or a different kind. In verse 20 Westcott
   and Hort read [allon] in the text, [heteron] in the margin.
   [ProsdokOmen], may be present indicative or present subjunctive
   (deliberative), the same contract form [ao= O, aO O].

   7:21 In that hour he cured [en ekeinei tei horai etherapeusen]. This
   item is not in Matthew. Jesus gave the two disciples of John an example
   of the direct method. They had heard. Then they saw for themselves.
   Diseases [nosOn], plagues [mastigOn], evil spirits [pneumatOn ponerOn],
   all kinds of bodily ills, and he singles out the blind [tuphlois] to
   whom in particular he bestowed sight [echarizato blepein], gave as a
   free gift (from [charis], grace) seeing [blepein].

   7:22 What things ye have seen and heard [ha eidete kai ekousate]. In Mt
   11:4, present tense "which ye do hear and see." Rest of verse 22, 23 as
   in Mt 11:4-6, which see for details. Luke mentions no raisings from the
   dead in verse 21, but the language is mainly general, while here it is
   specific. [Skandalizomai] used here has the double notion of to trip up
   and to entrap and in the N.T. always means causing to sin.

   7:24 When the messengers of John were departed [apelthontOn tOn aggelOn
   IOanou]. Genitive absolute of aorist active participle. Mt 11:7 has the
   present middle participle [poreuomenOn], suggesting that Jesus began
   his eulogy of John as soon as the messengers (angels, Luke calls them)
   were on their way. The vivid questions about the people's interest in
   John are precisely alike in both Matthew and Luke.

   7:25 Gorgeously apparelled [en himatismOi endoxOi]. In splendid
   clothing. Here alone in this sense in the N.T. And live delicately
   [truphei]. From [thruptO] to break down, to enervate, an old word for
   luxurious living. See the verb [truphaO] in Jas 5:5. In kings' courts
   [en tois basileiois]. Only here in the N.T. Mt 11:8 has it "in kings'
   houses." Verses 26, 27 are precisely alike in Mt 11:9,10, which see for
   discussion.

   7:26 A prophet? [propheten;]. A real prophet will always get a hearing
   if he has a message from God. He is a for-speaker, forth-teller
   [pro-phetes]. He may or may not be a fore-teller. The main thing is for
   the prophet to have a message from God which he is willing to tell at
   whatever cost to himself. The word of God came to John in the
   wilderness of Judea (Lu 3:2). That made him a prophet. There is a
   prophetic element in every real preacher of the Gospel. Real prophets
   become leaders and moulders of men.

   7:28 There is none [oudeis estin]. No one exists, this means. Mt 11:11
   has [ouk egegertai] (hath not arisen). See Matthew for discussion of
   "but little" and "greater."

   7:29 Justified God [edikaiOsan ton theon]. They considered God just or
   righteous in making these demands of them. Even the publicans did. They
   submitted to the baptism of John [baptisthentes to baptisma tou
   IOanou]. First aorist passive participle with the cognate accusative
   retained in the passive. Some writers consider verses 29, 30 a comment
   of Luke in the midst of the eulogy of John by Jesus. This would be a
   remarkable thing for so long a comment to be interjected. It is
   perfectly proper as the saying of Jesus.

   7:30 Rejected for themselves [ethetesan eis heautous]. The first aorist
   active of [atheteO] first seen in LXX and Polybius. Occurs in the
   papyri. These legalistic interpreters of the law refused to admit the
   need of confession of sin on their part and so set aside the baptism of
   John. They annulled God's purposes of grace so far as they applied to
   them. Being not baptized by him [me baptisthentes hup' autou]. First
   aorist passive participle. [Me] is the usual negative of the participle
   in the Koine.

   7:31 And to what are they like? [kai tini eisin homoioi;]. This second
   question is not in Mt 11:16. It sharpens the point. The case of [tini]
   is associative instrumental after [homoioi]. See discussion of details
   in Matthew.

   7:32 And ye did not weep [kai ouk eklausate]. Here Mt 1:17 has "and ye
   did not mourn (or beat your breast, [ouk ekopsasthe]. They all did it
   at funerals. These children would not play wedding or funeral.

   7:33 John the Baptist is come [eleluthen]. Second perfect active
   indicative where Mt 11:18 has [elthen] second aorist active indicative.
   So as to verse 34. Luke alone has "bread" and "wine." Otherwise these
   verses like Mt 11:18, 19, which see for discussion of details. There
   are actually critics today who say that Jesus was called the friend of
   sinners and even of harlots because he loved them and their ways and so
   deserved the slur cast upon him by his enemies. If men can say that
   today we need not wonder that the Pharisees and lawyers said it then to
   justify their own rejection of Jesus.

   7:35 Of all her children [apo pantOn tOn teknOn autes]. Here Mt 11:19
   has "by her works" [apo tOn ergOn autes]. Aleph has [ergOn] here. The
   use of "children" personifies wisdom as in Pr 8; 9.

   7:36 That he would eat with him [hina phagei met' autou]. Second aorist
   active subjunctive. The use of [hina] after [erOtaO] (see also Lu
   16:27) is on the border between the pure object clause and the indirect
   question (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1046) and the pure final clause. Luke
   has two other instances of Pharisees who invited Jesus to meals (11:37;
   14:1) and he alone gives them. This is the Gospel of Hospitality
   (Ragg). Jesus would dine with a Pharisee or with a publican (Lu 5:29;
   Mr 2:15; Mt 9:10) and even invited himself to be the guest of Zaccheus
   (Lu 9:5). This Pharisee was not as hostile as the leaders in Jerusalem.
   It is not necessary to think this Pharisee had any sinister motive in
   his invitation though he was not overly friendly (Plummer).

   7:37 A woman which was in the city, a sinner [gune hetis en tei polei
   hamartOlos]. Probably in Capernaum. The use of [hetis] means "Who was
   of such a character as to be" (cf. 8:3) and so more than merely the
   relative [he], who, that is, "who was a sinner in the city," a woman of
   the town, in other words, and known to be such. [HamartOlos], from
   [hamartanO], to sin, means devoted to sin and uses the same form for
   feminine and masculine. It is false and unjust to Mary Magdalene,
   introduced as a new character in Lu 8:2, to identify this woman with
   her. Luke would have no motive in concealing her name here and the life
   of a courtesan would be incompatible with the sevenfold possession of
   demons. Still worse is it to identify this courtesan not only with Mary
   Magdalene, but also with Mary of Bethany simply because it is a Simon
   who gives there a feast to Jesus when Mary of Bethany does a beautiful
   deed somewhat like this one here (Mr 14:3-9; Mt 26:6-13; Joh 12:2-8).
   Certainly Luke knew full well the real character of Mary of Bethany
   (10:38-42) so beautifully pictured by him. But a falsehood, once
   started, seems to have more lives than the cat's proverbial nine. The
   very name Magdalene has come to mean a repentant courtesan. But we can
   at least refuse to countenance such a slander on Mary Magdalene and on
   Mary of Bethany. This sinful woman had undoubtedly repented and changed
   her life and wished to show her gratitude to Jesus who had rescued her.
   Her bad reputation as a harlot clung to her and made her an unwelcome
   visitor in the Pharisee's house. When she knew [epignousa]. Second
   aorist active participle from [epiginOskO], to know fully, to
   recognize. She came in by a curious custom of the time that allowed
   strangers to enter a house uninvited at a feast, especially beggars
   seeking a gift. This woman was an intruder whereas Mary of Bethany was
   an invited guest. "Many came in and took their places on the side
   seats, uninvited and yet unchallenged. They spoke to those at table on
   business or the news of the day, and our host spoke freely to them"
   (Trench in his Parables, describing a dinner at a Consul's house at
   Damietta). He was sitting at meat [katakeitai]. Literally, he is
   reclining (present tense retained in indirect discourse in Greek). An
   alabaster cruse of ointment [alabastron murou]. See on Mt 26:7 for
   discussion of [alabastron] and [murou].

   7:38 Standing behind at his feet [stasa opisO para tous podas autou].
   Second aorist active participle from [histemi] and intransitive, first
   aorist [estesa] being transitive. The guest removed his sandals before
   the meal and he reclined on the left side with the feet outward. She
   was standing beside [para] his feet weeping [klaiousa]. She was drawn
   irresistibly by gratitude to Jesus and is overcome with emotion before
   she can use the ointment; her tears [tois dakrusin], instrumental case
   of [dakru] take the place of the ointment. Wiped them with the hair of
   her head [tais thrixin tes kephales autes exemassen]. Inchoative
   imperfect of an old verb [ekmassO], to rub out or off, began to wipe
   off, an act of impulse evidently and of embarrassment. "Among the Jews
   it was a shameful thing for a woman to let down her hair in public; but
   she makes this sacrifice" (Plummer). So Mary of Bethany wiped the feet
   of Jesus with her hair (Joh 12:3) with a similar sacrifice out of her
   great love for Jesus. This fact is relied on by some to prove that Mary
   of Bethany had been a woman of bad character, surely an utter failure
   to recognize Mary's motive and act. Kissed [katephilei]. Imperfect
   active of [kataphileO], to kiss repeatedly (force of [kata], and
   accented by the tense of continued action here. The word in the N.T.
   occurs here, of the prodigal's father (15:20), of the kiss of Judas (Mr
   14:45; Mt 26:49), of the Ephesian elders (Ac 20:37). " Kissing the feet
   was a common mark of deep reverence, especially to leading rabbis"
   (Plummer). Anointed them with the ointment [eleiphen tOi murOi].
   Imperfect active again of [aleiphO], a very common verb. [ChriO] has a
   more religious sense. The anointing came after the burst of emotional
   excitement.

   7:39 This man [houtos]. Contemptuous, this fellow. If he were a (the)
   prophet [ei en [ho] prophetes]. Condition of the second class,
   determined as unfulfilled. The Pharisee assumes that Jesus is not a
   prophet (or the prophet, reading of B, that he claims to be). A Greek
   condition puts the thing from the standpoint of the speaker or writer.
   It does not deal with the actual facts, but only with the statement
   about the facts. Would have perceived [eginOsken an]. Wrong
   translation, would now perceive or know (which he assumes that Jesus
   does not do). The protasis is false and the conclusion also. He is
   wrong in both. The conclusion (apodosis), like the condition, deals
   here with the present situation and so both use the imperfect
   indicative [an] in the conclusion, a mere device for making it plain
   that it is not a condition of the first class). Who and what manner of
   woman [tis kai potape he gune]. She was notorious in person and
   character.

   7:40 Answering [apokritheis]. First aorist passive participle,
   redundant use with [eipen]. Jesus answers the thoughts and doubts of
   Simon and so shows that he knows all about the woman also. Godet notes
   a tone of Socratic irony here.

   7:41 A certain lender [danistei tini]. A lender of money with interest.
   Here alone in the N.T. though a common word. Debtors [chreophiletai].
   From [chreO] (debt, obligation) and [opheilO], to owe. Only here and
   16:5 in the N.T., though common in late Greek writers. Owed [Opheilen].
   Imperfect active and so unpaid. Five hundred [denaria] and fifty like
   two hundred and fifty dollars and twenty-five dollars.

   7:42 Will love him most [pleion agapesei auton]. Strictly, comparative
   more, [pleion], not superlative [pleista], but most suits the English
   idiom best, even between two. Superlative forms are vanishing before
   the comparative in the Koine.This is the point of the parable, the
   attitude of the two debtors toward the lender who forgave both of them
   (Plummer).

   7:43 I suppose [hupolambanO]. Old verb, originally to take up from
   under, to bear away as on high, to take up in speech (Lu 10:30), to
   take up in mind or to assume as here and Ac 2:15. Here with an air of
   supercilious indifference (Plummer). The most [to pleion]. The more.
   Rightly [orthOs]. Correctly. Socrates was fond of [panu orthOs]. The
   end of the argument.

   7:44 Turning [strapheis]. Second aorist passive participle. Seest thou
   [blepeis]. For the first time Jesus looks at the woman and he asks the
   Pharisee to look at her. She was behind Jesus. Jesus was an invited
   guest. The Pharisee had neglected some points of customary hospitality.
   The contrasts here made have the rhythm of Hebrew poetry. In each
   contrast the first word is the point of defect in Simon: water (44),
   kiss (45), oil (46).

   7:45 Hath not ceased to kiss [ou dielipen kataphilousa]. Supplementary
   participle.

   7:46 With ointment [murOi]. Instrumental case. She used the costly
   ointment even for the feet of Jesus.

   7:47 Are forgiven [apheOntai]. Doric perfect passive form. See Lu
   5:21,23. For she loved much [hoti egapesen polu]. Illustration or
   proof, not reason for the forgiveness. Her sins had been already
   forgiven and remained forgiven. But to whom little is forgiven, the
   same loveth little [HOi de oligon aphietai oligon agapai]. This
   explanation proves that the meaning of [hoti] preceding is proof, not
   cause.

   7:48 Are forgiven [apheOntai]. As in verse 47. Remain forgiven, Jesus
   means, in spite of the slur of the Pharisee.

   7:49 Who even forgiveth sins [hos kai hamartias aphiesin]. Present
   indicative active of same verb, [aphiemi]. Once before the Pharisees
   considered Jesus guilty of blasphemy in claiming the power to forgive
   sins (Lu 5:21). Jesus read their inmost thoughts as he always does.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 8

   8:1 Soon afterwards [en tOi kathexes]. In 7:11 we have [en tOi hexes].
   This word means one after the other, successively, but that gives no
   definite data as to the time, only that this incident in 8:1-3 follows
   that in 7:36-50). Both in Luke alone. That [kai]. One of Luke's idioms
   with [kai egeneto] like Hebrew wav.Went about [diOdeuen]. Imperfect
   active of [diodeuO], to make one's way through [dia, hodos], common in
   late Greek writers. In the N.T. here only and Ac 17:1. Through cities
   and villages [kata polin kai kOmen]. Distributive use of [kata] (up and
   down). The clause is amphibolous and goes equally well with [diOdeuen]
   or with [kerussOn] (heralding) [kai euaggelizomenos] (evangelizing,
   gospelizing). This is the second tour of Galilee, this time the Twelve
   with him.

   8:2 Which had been healed [hai esan tetherapeumenai]. Periphrastic past
   perfect passive, suggesting that the healing had taken place some time
   before this tour. These women all had personal grounds of gratitude to
   Jesus. From whom seven devils (demons) had gone out [aph' hes daimonia
   hepta exeleluthei]. Past perfect active third singular for the
   [daimonia] are neuter plural. This first mention of Mary Magdalene
   describes her special cause of gratitude. This fact is stated also in
   Mr 16:9 in the disputed close of the Gospel. The presence of seven
   demons in one person indicates special malignity (Mr 5:9). See Mt 17:45
   for the parable of the demon who came back with seven other demons
   worse than the first. It is not known where Magdala was, whence Mary
   came.

   8:3 Joanna [IOana]. Her husband [Chuza], steward [epitropou] of Herod,
   is held by some to be the nobleman [basilikos] of Joh 4:46-53 who
   believed and all his house. At any rate Christ had a follower from the
   household of Herod Antipas who had such curiosity to see and hear him.
   One may recall also Manaen (Ac 13:1), Herod's foster brother. Joanna is
   mentioned again with Mary Magdalene in Lu 24:10). Who ministered unto
   them [haitines diekonoun autois]. Imperfect active of [diakoneO],
   common verb, but note augment as if from [dia] and [akoneO], but from
   [diakonos] and that from [dia] and [konis] (dust). The very fact that
   Jesus now had twelve men going with him called for help from others and
   the women of means responded to the demand. Of their substance [ek tOn
   huparchontOn autais]. From the things belonging to them. This is the
   first woman's missionary society for the support of missionaries of the
   Gospel. They had difficulties in their way, but they overcame these, so
   great was their gratitude and zeal.

   8:4 By a parable [dia paraboles]. Mr 4:2 says "in parables" as does Mt
   13:3. This is the beginning of the first great group of parables as
   given in Mr 4:1-34 and Mt 13:1-53. There are ten of these parables in
   Mark and Matthew and only two in Lu 8:4-18 (The Sower and the Lamp,
   8:16) though Luke also has the expression "in parables" (8:10). See Mt
   13 and Mr 4 for discussion of the word parable and the details of the
   Parable of the Sower. Luke does not locate the place, but he mentions
   the great crowds on hand, while both Mark and Matthew name the seaside
   as the place where Jesus was at the start of the series of parables.

   8:5 His seed [ton sporon autou]. Peculiar to Luke. Was trodden under
   foot [katepatethe]. First aorist passive indicative of [katapateO].
   Peculiar to Luke here. Of the heavens [tou ouranou]. Added in Luke.

   8:6 Upon the rock [epi ten petran]. Mr 4:5 "the rocky ground" [epi to
   petrOdes], Mt 13:5 "the rocky places. As soon as it grew [phuen].
   Second aorist passive participle of [phuO], an old verb to spring up
   like a sprout. Withered away [exeranthe]. First aorist passive
   indicative of [zerainO], old verb, to dry up. Moisture [ikmada]. Here
   only in the N.T., though common word.

   8:7 Amidst the thorns [en mesOi tOn akanthOn]. Mr 4:7 has [eis] (among)
   and Mt 13:7 has [epi] "upon." Grew with it [sunphueisai]. Same
   participle as [phuen] above with [sun-] (together). Choked [apepnixan].
   From [apopnigO], to choke off as in Mt 13:7. In Mr 4:7 the verb is
   [sunepnixan] (choked together).

   8:8 A hundredfold [hekatonplasiona]. Luke omits the thirty and sixty of
   Mr 4:8; Mt 13:8. He cried [ephOnei]. Imperfect active, and in a loud
   voice, the verb means. The warning about hearing with the ears occurs
   also in Mr 4:9; Mt 13:9.

   8:9 Asked [eperOtOn]. Imperfect of [eperOtaO] [epi] and [erOtaO] where
   Mr 4:10 has [erOtOn] (uncompounded imperfect), both the tense and the
   use of [epi] indicate eager and repeated questions on the part of the
   disciples, perhaps dimly perceiving a possible reflection on their own
   growth. What this parable might be [tis haute eie he parabole]. A
   mistranslation, What this parable was (or meant). The optative [eie] is
   merely due to indirect discourse, changing the indicative [estin] (is)
   of the direct question to the optative [eie] of the indirect, a change
   entirely with the writer or speaker and without any change of meaning
   (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1043f.).

   8:10 The mysteries [ta musteria]. See for this word on Mt 13:11; Mr
   4:11. Part of the mystery here explained is how so many people who have
   the opportunity to enter the kingdom fail to do so because of manifest
   unfitness. That [hina]. Here Mr 4:11 also has [hina] while Mt 13:13 has
   [hoti] (because). On the so-called causal use of [hina] as here equal
   to [hoti] see discussion on Mt 13:13; Mr 4:11. Plummer sensibly argues
   that there is truth both in the causal [hoti] of Matthew and the final
   [hina] of Mark and Matthew. "But the principle that he who hath shall
   receive more, while he who hath not shall be deprived of what he
   seemeth to have, explains both the [hina] and the [hoti]. Jesus speaks
   in parables because the multitudes see without seeing and hear without
   hearing. But He also speaks in parable in order that they may see
   without seeing and hear without hearing." Only for "hearing" Luke has
   "understand" [suniOsin], present subjunctive from a late omega form
   [suniO] instead of the [-mi] verb [suniemi].

   8:11 Is this [estin de haute]. Means this. Jesus now proceeds to
   interpret his own parable. The seed is the word of God [ho sporos estin
   ho logos tou theou]. The article with both subject and predicate as
   here means that they are interchangeable and can be turned round: The
   word of God is the seed. The phrase "the word of God" does not appear
   in Matthew and only once in Mark (Mr 7:13) and John (Joh 10:35), but
   four times in Luke (5:1; 8:11, 21; 11:28) and twelve times in Acts. In
   Mr 4:14 we have only "the word." In Mr 3:31 we have "the will of God,"
   and in Mt 12:46 "the will of my Father" where Lu 8:21 has "the word of
   God." This seems to show that Luke has the subjective genitive here and
   means the word that comes from God.

   8:12 Those by the wayside [hoi para ten hodon]. As in Mr 4:15; Mt 13:19
   so here the people who hear the word = the seed are discussed by
   metonymy. The devil [ho diabolos]. The slanderer. Here Mr 4:15 has
   Satan. From their heart [apo tes kardias autOn]. Here Mark has "in
   them." It is the devil's business to snatch up the seed from the heart
   before it sprouts and takes root. Every preacher knows how successful
   the devil is with his auditors. Mt 13:19 has it "sown in the heart."
   That they may not believe and be saved [hina me pisteusantes sOthOsin].
   Peculiar to Luke. Negative purpose with aorist active participle and
   first aorist (ingressive) passive subjunctive. Many reasons are offered
   today for the failure of preachers to win souls. Here is the main one,
   the activity of the devil during and after the preaching of the sermon.
   No wonder then that the sower must have good seed and sow wisely, for
   even then he can only win partial success.

   8:13 Which for a while believe [hoi pros kairon pisteuousin].
   Ostensibly they are sincere and have made a real start in the life of
   faith. They fall away [aphistantai]. Present middle indicative. They
   stand off, lose interest, stop coming to church, drop out of sight. It
   is positively amazing the number of new church members who "stumble" as
   Mr 4:17 has it [skandalizontai], do not like the pastor, take offence
   at something said or done by somebody, object to the appeals for money,
   feel slighted. The "season of trial" becomes a "season of temptation"
   [en kairOi peirasmou] for these superficial, emotional people who have
   to be periodically rounded up if kept within the fold.

   8:14 They are choked [sunpnigontai]. Present passive indicative of this
   powerfully vivid compound verb [sunpnigO] used in Mr 4:19; Mt 13:22,
   only there these worldly weeds choke the word while here the victims
   themselves are choked. Both are true. Diphtheria will choke and
   strangle the victim. Who has not seen the promise of fair flower and
   fruit choked into yellow withered stalk without fruit "as they go on
   their way" [poreuomenoi]. Bring no fruit to perfection [ou
   telesphorousin]. Compound verb common in the late writers [telos,
   phoreO]. To bring to completion. Used of fruits, animals, pregnant
   women. Only here in the N.T.

   8:15 In an honest and good heart [en kardiai kalei kai agathei].
   Peculiar to Luke. In verse 8 the land [gen] is called [agathen] (really
   good, generous) and in verse 15 we have [en tei kalei gei] (in the
   beautiful or noble land). So Luke uses both adjectives of the heart.
   The Greeks used [kalos k' agathos] of the high-minded gentleman. It is
   probable that Luke knew this idiom. It occurs here alone in the N.T. It
   is not easy to translate. We have such phrases as "good and true,"
   "sound and good," "right and good," no one of which quite suits the
   Greek. Certainly Luke adds new moral qualities not in the Hellenic
   phrase. The English word "honest" here is like the Latin honestus
   (fair, noble). The words are to be connected with "hold fast"
   [katechousin], "hold it down" so that the devil does not snatch it
   away, having depth of soil so that it does not shrivel up under the
   sun, and is not choked by weeds and thorns. It bears fruit
   [karpophorousin], an old expressive verb, [karpos] and [phoreO]. That
   is the proof of spiritual life. In patience [en hupomonei]. There is no
   other way for real fruit to come. Mushrooms spring up overnight, but
   they are usually poisonous. The best fruits require time, cultivation,
   patience.

   8:16 When he hath lighted a lamp [luchnon hapsas]. It is a portable
   lamp [luchnon] that one lights [hapsas] aorist active participle of
   [haptO], to kindle, fasten to, light). With a vessel [skeuei],
   instrumental case of [skeuos]. Here Mr 4:21 has the more definite
   figure "under the bushel" as has Mt 5:15. Under the bed [hupokatO
   klines]. Here Mr 4:21 has the regular [hupo ten klinen] instead of the
   late compound [hupokatO]. Ragg notes that Matthew distributes the
   sayings of Jesus given here by Lu 8:16-18; Mr 4:21-25 concerning the
   parable of the lamp and gives them in three separate places (Mt 5:15;
   10:26; 13:12). That is true, but it does not follow that Mark and Luke
   have bunched together separate sayings or that Matthew has scattered
   sayings delivered only on one occasion. One of the slowest lessons for
   some critics to learn is that Jesus repeated favourite sayings on
   different occasions and in different groupings just as every popular
   preacher and teacher does today. See on Mr 4:21 for further discussion
   of the lamp and stand. May see the light [BlepOsin to phOs]. In Mt 5:16
   Jesus has it "may see your good works." The purpose of light is to let
   one see something else, not the light. Note present subjunctive
   [blepOsin], linear action "Jesus had kindled a light within them. They
   must not hide it, but must see that it spreads to others" (Plummer).
   The parable of the lamp throws light on the parable of the sower.

   8:17 That shall not be known [ho ou me gnOsthei]. Peculiar to Luke.
   First aorist passive subjunctive of [ginOskO] with the strong double
   negative [ou me]. See on Mr 4:22 for discussion of [krupton] and
   [apokruphon].

   8:18 How ye hear [pOs akouete]. The manner of hearing. Mr 4:24 has
   "what ye hear" [ti akouete], the matter that is heard. Both are
   supremely important. Some things should not be heard at all. Some that
   are heard should be forgotten. Others should be treasured and
   practised. For whosoever hath [Hos an gar echei]. Present active
   subjunctive of the common verb [echO] which may mean "keep on having"
   or "acquiring." See on Mr 4:25 for discussion. Thinketh he hath [dokei
   echein], or seems to acquire or to hold. Losses in business illustrate
   this saying as when we see their riches take wings and fly away. So it
   is with hearing and heeding. Self-deception is a common complaint.

   8:19 His mother and brethren [he meter kai hoi adelphoi autou]. Mr
   3:31-35; Mt 12:46-50 place the visit of the mother and brothers of
   Jesus before the parable of the sower. Usually Luke follows Mark's
   order, but he does not do so here. At first the brothers of Jesus
   (younger sons of Joseph and Mary, I take the words to mean, there being
   sisters also) were not unfriendly to the work of Jesus as seen in Joh
   2:12 when they with the mother of Jesus are with him and the small
   group (half dozen) disciples in Capernaum after the wedding in Cana.
   But as Jesus went on with his work and was rejected at Nazareth (Lu
   4:16-31), there developed an evident disbelief in his claims on the
   part of the brothers who ridiculed him six months before the end (Joh
   7:5). At this stage they have apparently come with Mary to take Jesus
   home out of the excitement of the crowds, perhaps thinking that he is
   beside himself (Mr 3:21. They hardly believed the charge of the rabbis
   that Jesus was in league with Beelzebub. Certainly the mother of Jesus
   could give no credence to that slander. But she herself was deeply
   concerned and wanted to help him if possible. See discussion of the
   problem in my little book The Mother of Jesus and also on Mr 3:31 and
   Mt 12:46. Come to him [suntuchein]. Second aorist active infinitive of
   [suntugchanO], an old verb, though here alone in the N.T., meaning to
   meet with, to fall in with as if accidentally, here with associative
   instrumental case [autOi].

   8:20 Was told [apeggele]. Second aorist passive indicative of
   [apaggellO], to bring word or tidings. Common verb. See on Mr 3:32 and
   Mt 12:47 for details.

   8:21 These which hear the word of God and do it [hoi ton logon tou
   theou akouontes kai poiountes]. The absence of the article with
   "mother" and "brothers" probably means, as Plummer argues, "Mother to
   me and brothers to me are those who &c." No one is a child of God
   because of human parentage (Joh 1:13). "Family ties are at best
   temporal; spiritual ties are eternal" (Plummer) . Note the use of "hear
   and do" together here as in Mt 7:24; Lu 6:47 at the close of the Sermon
   on the Mount. The parable of the sower is almost like a footnote to
   that sermon. Later Jesus will make "doing" a test of friendship for him
   (Joh 15:14).

   8:22 And they launched forth [kai anechthesan]. First aorist passive
   indicative of [anagO], an old verb, to lead up, to put out to sea
   (looked at as going up from the land). This nautical sense of the verb
   occurs only in Luke in the N.T. and especially in the Acts (Ac 13:13;
   16:11; 18:21; 20:3,13; 21:1,2; 27:2, 4, 12, 21; 28:10f.).

   8:23 He fell asleep [aphupnOsen]. First aorist (ingressive) active
   indicative of [aphupnoO], to put to sleep, to fall off to sleep, a late
   verb for which the older Greek used [kathupnoO]. Originally [aphupnoO]
   meant to waken from sleep, then to fall off to sleep (possibly a
   medical use). This is the only passage which speaks of the sleep of
   Jesus. Here only in the N.T. Came down [katebe]. Second aorist active
   indicative of [katabainO], common verb. It was literally true. These
   wind storms [lailaps]. So also Mr 4:37) rushed from Hermon down through
   the Jordan gorge upon the Sea of Galilee and shook it like a tempest
   (Mt 8:24). Mark's (Mr 4:37) vivid use of the dramatic present [ginetai]
   (ariseth) is not so precise as Luke's "came down." See on Mt 8:24.
   These sudden squalls were dangerous on this small lake. They were
   filling [suneplerounto]. Imperfect passive. It was the boat that was
   being filled (Mr 4:37) and it is here applied to the navigators as
   sailors sometimes spoke. An old verb, but in the N.T. used only by Luke
   (8:23; 9:51; Ac 2:1). Were in jeopardy [ekinduneuon]. Imperfect active,
   vivid description. Old verb, but in the N.T. only here, Ac 19:27; 1Co
   15:30).

   8:24 Master, Master [Epistata, epistata]. See on Lu 5:5 for discussion.
   Mr 4:38 has Teacher [Didaskale], Mt 8:25 has Lord [Kurie]. The
   repetition here shows the uneasiness of the disciples. We perish
   [apollumetha]. So in Mr 4:38; Mt 8:25. Linear present middle
   indicative, we are perishing. The raging of the water [tOi kludoni tou
   hudatos]. [KludOn], common Greek word, is a boisterous surge, a violent
   agitation. Here only in the N.T. save Jas 1:6. [Kuma] (Mr 4:37) is the
   regular swell or wave. A calm [galene]. Only in the parallels in the
   N.T., though common word. Here Mr 4:39; Mt 8:26 add great [megale].
   That [hoti]. This use of [hoti] as explanatory of the demonstrative
   pronoun [houtos] occurs in the parallels Mr 4:36; Mt 8:27 and also in
   Lu 4:36. It is almost result. He commandeth [epitassei]. Peculiar to
   Luke.

   8:26 They arrived [katepleusan]. First aorist active indicative of
   [katapleO], common verb, but here only in the N.T. Literally, they
   sailed down from the sea to the land, the opposite of launched forth
   [anechthesan] of verse 22. So we today use like nautical terms, to bear
   up, to bear down. The Gerasenes [ton GerasenOn]. This is the correct
   text here as in Mr 5:1 while Gadarenes is correct in Mt 8:28. See there
   for explanation of this famous discrepancy, now cleared up by Thomson's
   discovery of Khersa [Gersa] on the steep eastern bank and in the
   vicinity of Gadara. Over against Galilee [antipera tes Galilaias]. Only
   here in the N.T. The later Greek form is [antiperan] (Polybius, etc.).
   Some MSS. here have [peran] like Mr 5:1; Mt 8:28.

   8:27 And for a long time [kai chronOi hikanOi]. The use of the
   associative instrumental case in expressions of time is a very old
   Greek idiom that still appears in the papyri (Robertson, Grammar, p.
   527). He had worn no clothes [ouk enedusato himation]. First aorist
   middle indicative, constative aorist, viewing the "long time" as a
   point. Not pluperfect as English has it and not for the pluperfect,
   simply "and for a long time he did not put on himself (indirect middle)
   any clothing." The physician would naturally note this item. Common
   verb [enduO] or [endunO]. This item in Luke alone, though implied by Mr
   5:15 "clothed" [himatismenon]. And abode not in any house [kai en
   oikiai ouk emenen]. Imperfect active. Peculiar to Luke, though implied
   by the mention of tombs in all three (Mr 5:3; Mt 8:28; Lu 8:27).

   8:28 Fell down [prosepesen]. Second aorist active of [prospiptO], to
   fall forward, towards, prostrate before one as here. Common verb. Mr
   5:6 has [prosekunesen] (worshipped). The Most High God [tou theou tou
   hupsistou]. Uncertain whether [tou theou] genuine or not. But "the Most
   High" clearly means God as already seen (Lu 1:32,35,36; 6:35). The
   phrase is common among heathen (Nu 24:16; Mic 6:6; Isa 14:14). The
   demoniac may have been a Gentile, but it is the demon here speaking.
   See on Mr 2:7; Mt 8:29 for the Greek idiom [ti emoi kai soi]. "What
   have I to do with thee?" See there also for "Torment me not."

   8:29 For he commanded [pareggellen gar]. Imperfect active, correct
   text, for he was commanding. Often times [pollois chronois]. Or "for a
   long time" like [chronOi pollOi] of verse 27 (see Robertson, Grammar,
   p. 537, for the plural here). It had seized [sunerpakei]. Past perfect
   active of [sunarpazO], to lay hold by force. An old verb, but only in
   Luke in the N.T. (Lu 8:29; Ac 6:12; 19:29; 27:15). Was kept under guard
   [edesmeueto]. Imperfect passive of [desmeuO] to put in chains, from
   [desmos], bond, and that from [deO] to bind. Old, but rather rare verb.
   Only here and Ac 22:4 in this sense. In Mt 23:4 it means to bind
   together. Some MSS. read [desmeO] in Lu 8:29. Breaking the bands
   asunder [diaressOn ta desma]. Old verb, the preposition [dia] (in two)
   intensifying the meaning of the simple verb [ressO] or [regnumi], to
   rend. Was driven [elauneto]. Imperfect passive of [elaunO], to drive,
   to row, to march (Xenophon). Only five times in the N.T. Here alone in
   Luke and peculiar to Luke in this incident.

   8:30 Legion [LegiOn]. See on Mr 5:9.

   8:31 Into the abyss [eis ten abusson]. Rare old word common in LXX from
   [a] privative and [bath-s] (deep). So bottomless place (supply [chOra].
   The deep sea in Ge 1:2; 7:11. The common receptacle of the dead in Ro
   10:7 and especially the abode of demons as here and Re 9:1-11; 11:7;
   17:8; 20:1,3.

   8:32 A herd of many swine [agele choirOn hikanOn]. Word herd [agele]
   old as Homer, but in N.T. only here and parallels (Mr 5:11; Mt 8:30).
   Luke shows his fondness for adjective [hikanos] here again (see verse
   27) where Mark has [megale] and Matthew [pollOn].

   8:33 Rushed down the steep [hOrmesen kata tou kremnou]. Ablative with
   [kata] as in Mr 5:13; Mt 8:32 and the same vivid verb in each account,
   to hurl impetuously, to rush. Were choked [apepnige]. Second aorist
   (constative) passive indicative third singular (collective singular)
   where Mr 5:13 has the picturesque imperfect [epnigonto].

   8:34 Saw what had come to pass [idontes to gegonos]. This item only in
   Luke. Note the neat Greek idiom [to gegonos], articular second perfect
   active participle of [ginomai]. Repeated in verse 35 and in Mr 5:14.
   Note numerous participles here in verse 35 as in Mr 5:15.

   8:36 He that was possessed with devils (demons) (only two words in
   Greek, [ho daimonistheis], the demonized). Was made whole [esOthe].
   First aorist passive indicative of [sOzO] to save from [sOs] (safe and
   sound). This is additional information to the news carried to them in
   verse 34.

   8:37 Were holden with great fear [phobOi megalOi suneichonto].
   Imperfect passive of [sunechO] with the instrumental case of [phobos].
   See a similar use of this vigorous verb in Lu 12:50 of Jesus and in Php
   1:23 of Paul.

   8:38 From whom the devils (demons) were gone out [aph' hou exeleluthei
   ta daimonia]. Past perfect active of [exerchomai], state of completion
   in the past. Prayed him [edeeito autou]. Imperfect middle, kept on
   begging.

   8:39 Throughout the whole city [kath' holen ten polin]. Mr 5:20 has it
   "in Decapolis." He had a great story to tell and he told it with power.
   The rescue missions in our cities can match this incident with cases of
   great sinners who have made witnesses for Christ.

   8:40 Welcomed [apedexato]. Peculiar to Luke. To receive with pleasure,
   from [apodechomai], a common verb. For they were all waiting for him
   [esan gar pantes prosdokOntes auton]. Periphrastic imperfect active of
   prosdokaO, an old verb for eager expectancy, a vivid picture of the
   attitude of the people towards Jesus. Driven from Decapolis, he is
   welcomed in Capernaum.

   8:41 Was [huperchen]. Imperfect of [huparchO] in sense of [en] as in
   modern Greek. Common in Luke, and Acts, but not in other Gospels.

   8:42 An only daughter [thugater monogenes]. The same adjective used of
   the widow's son (7:12) and the epileptic boy (9:38) and of Jesus (Joh
   1:18; 3:16). She lay a dying [apethnesken]. Imperfect active, she was
   dying. Mt 9:18 has it that she has just died. Thronged [sunepnigon].
   Imperfect active of [sumpnigO], to press together, the verb used of the
   thorns choking the growing grain (Lu 8:14). It was a jam.

   8:43 Had spent all her living upon physicians [eis iatrous
   prosanalOsasa holon ton bion]. First aorist active participle of an old
   verb [prosanaliskO], only here in the N.T. But Westcott and Hort reject
   this clause because it is not in B D Syriac Sinaitic. Whether genuine
   or not, the other clause in Mr 5:26 certainly is not in Luke: "had
   suffered many things of many physicians." Probably both are not genuine
   in Luke who takes care of the physicians by the simple statement that
   it was a chronic case: could not be healed of any [ouk ischusen ap'
   oudenos therapeuthenai]. He omitted also what Mark has: "and was
   nothing bettered but rather grew worse."

   8:44 The border of his garment [tou kraspedou tou himatiou]. Probably
   the tassel of the overgarment. Of the four corners two were in front
   and two behind. See on Mt 9:20). Stanched [este]. Second aorist active
   indicative, stopped at once (effective aorist).

   8:45 Press thee and crush thee [sunechousin se kai apothlibousin]. Hold
   thee together, hold thee in [sunechO], see verse 37). Crush thee
   [apothlibO] here only in the N.T., a verb used of pressing out grapes
   in Diodorus and Josephus. Mr 5:31 has [sunthlibO], to press together.

   8:46 For I perceived that power had gone forth from me [egO gar egnOn
   dunamin exeleluthuian ap' emou]. [EgnOn] is second aorist active
   indicative of [ginOskO], knowledge by personal experience as here. It
   is followed by the second perfect active participle [exeleluthuian] in
   indirect discourse (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1040-42). Jesus felt the
   sensation of power already gone. Who does not know what this sense of
   "goneness" or exhaustion of nervous energy means?

   8:47 Trembling [tremousa]. Vivid touch of the feeling of this sensitive
   woman who now had to tell everybody of her cure, "in the presence of
   all the people" [enOpion pantos tou laou]. She faced the widest
   publicity for her secret cure.

   8:49 From the ruler of the synagogue's house [para tou archisunagOgou].
   The word "house" is not in the Greek here as in Mr 5:35 where [apo] is
   used rather than [para], as here. But the ruler himself had come to
   Jesus (Lu 8:41) and this is the real idea. Trouble not [meketi skulle].
   See on Lu 7:6 for this verb and also Mr 5:35; Mt 9:36.

   8:50 And she shall be made whole [kai sOthesetai]. This promise in
   addition to the words in Mr 5:36. See there for discussion of details.

   8:53 Knowing that she was dead [eidotes hoti apethanen]. That she died
   [apethanen], second aorist active indicative of [apothneskO].

   8:54 Called [ephOnesen]. Certainly not to wake up the dead, but to make
   it plain to all that she rose in response to his elevated tone of
   voice. Some think that the remark of Jesus in verse 52 (Mr 5:39; Mt
   9:24) proves that she was not really dead, but only in a trance. It
   matters little. The touch of Christ's hand and the power of his voice
   restored her to life. Maiden [he pais] rather than Mark's (Mr 5:41) [to
   korasion] (vernacular Koine).

   8:55 Her spirit returned [epestrepsen to pneuma autes]. The life came
   back to her at once. Be given her to eat [autei dothenai phagein]. The
   first infinitive [dothenai] is an indirect command. The second
   [phagein] (second aorist active of [esthiO] is epexegetic purpose.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 9

   9:1 He called the twelve together [sunkalesamenos tous dOdeka]. Mr 6:7;
   Mt 10:1 have [proskaleOmai], to call to him. Both the indirect middle
   voice.

   9:2 He sent them forth [apesteilen autous]. First aorist active
   indicative of [apostellO]. To preach the kingdom of God and to heal the
   sick [kerussein ten basileian tou theou kai iasthai]. Present
   indicative for the continuous functions during this campaign. This
   double office of herald [kerussein] and healer [iasthai] is stated
   directly in Mt 10:7-8. Note the verb [iaomai] for healing here, though
   [therapeuein] in verse 1, apparently used interchangeably.

   9:3 Neither staff [mete rabdon]. For the apparent contradiction between
   these words (Mt 10:10) and Mr 6:8 see discussion there. For [peran]
   (wallet) see also on Mr 6:8 (Mt 10:10) for this and other details here.

   9:5 As many as receive you not [hosoi an me dechOntai humas].
   Indefinite relative plural with [an] and present middle subjunctive and
   the negative [me]. Here Mt 10:14 has the singular (whosoever) and Mr
   6:11 has "whatsoever place." For a testimony against them [eis
   marturion ep' autous]. Note use of [ep' autous] where Mr 6:11 has
   simply the dative [autois] (disadvantage), really the same idea.

   9:6 Went [dierchonto]. Imperfect middle, continuous and repeated action
   made plainer also by three present participles [exerchomenoi,
   euaggelizomenoi, therapeuontes], describing the wide extent of the work
   through all the villages [kata tas kOmas], distributive use of [kata]
   everywhere [pantachou] in Galilee.

   9:7 All that was done [ta ginomena panta]. Present middle participle,
   "all that was coming to pass." He was much perplexed [dieporei].
   Imperfect active of [diaporeO], to be thoroughly at a loss, unable to
   find a way out [dia, a] privative, [poros], way), common ancient verb,
   but only in Luke's writings in the N.T. Because it was said [dia to
   legesthai]. Neat Greek idiom, the articular passive infinitive after
   [dia]. Three reports came to the ears of Herod as Luke has it, each
   introduced by [hoti] (that) in indirect discourse: "By some" [hupo
   tinOn], "by some" [hupo tinOn de], "by others" [allOn de, hupo] not
   here expressed, but carried over). The verbs in the indirect discourse
   here (verses 7, 8) are all three aorists [egerthe] first passive;
   [ephane] second passive; [aneste] second active), not past perfects as
   the English has them.

   9:9 He sought [ezetei]. Imperfect active. He keep on seeking to see
   Jesus. The rumours disturbed Herod because he was sure that he had put
   him to death ("John I beheaded").

   9:10 Declared [diegesanto]. First aorist middle of [diegeomai], to
   carry a narrative through to the end. Jesus listened to it all. They
   had done [epoiesan]. Aorist active indicative, they did. He took them
   [paralabOn autous]. Second aorist active participle of [paralambanO].
   Very common verb. Bethsaida [Bethsaida]. Peculiar to Luke. Bethsaida
   Julias is the territory of Philip, for it is on the other side of the
   Sea of Galilee (Joh 6:1).

   9:11 Spake [elalei]. Imperfect active, he continued speaking. He healed
   [iato]. Imperfect middle, he continued healing.

   9:12 To wear away [klinein]. Old verb usually transitive, to bend or
   bow down. Many compounds as in English decline, incline, recline,
   clinic [kline], bed), etc. Luke alone in the N.T. uses it
   intransitively as here. The sun was turning down towards setting. Lodge
   [katalusOsin]. First aorist active subjunctive of [kataluO], a common
   verb, to dissolve, destroy, overthrow, and then of travellers to break
   a journey, to lodge [kataluma], inn, Lu 2:7). Only here and 19:7 in the
   N.T. in this sense. Get victuals [heurOsin episitismon]. Ingressive
   aorist active of [heuriskO], very common verb. Victuals [episitismon],
   from [episitizomai], to provision oneself, [sitizO], from [siton],
   wheat) only here in the N.T., though common in ancient Greek,
   especially for provisions for a journey (snack). See on Mr 6:32-44; Mt
   14:13-21 for discussion of details.

   9:13 Except we should go and buy food [ei meti poreuthentes hemeis
   agorasOmen brOmata]. This is a condition of the third class with the
   aorist subjunctive [agorasOmen], where the conjunction is usually [ean]
   (with negative [ean me], but not always or necessarily so especially in
   the Koine.So in 1Co 14:5 [ei me diermeneuei] and in Php 3:12 [ei kai
   katalabO]. "Unless" is better here than "except." Food [brOmata], means
   eaten pieces from [bibrOskO], to eat, somewhat like our "edibles" or
   vernacular "eats."

   9:14 About [hOsei]. Luke as Mt 14:21 adds this word to the definite
   statement of Mr 6:44 that there were 5,000 men, a hundred companies of
   fifty each. Sit down [kataklinate]. First aorist active imperative.
   Recline, lie down. Only in Luke in the N.T. See also verse 15. In
   companies [klisias]. Cognate accusative after kataklinate. Only here in
   the N.T. A row of persons reclining at meals (table company). About
   fifty each [hOsei ana pentekonta]. Distributive use of [ana] and
   approximate number again [hOsei].

   9:16 The five . . . the two [tous pente ... tous duo]. Pointing back to
   verse 13, fine example of the Greek article. And gave [kai edidou].
   Imperfect active of [didOmi], kept on giving. This picturesque
   imperfect is preceded by the aorist [kateklasen] (brake), a single act.
   This latter verb in the N.T. only here and the parallel in Mr 6:41,
   though common enough in ancient Greek. We say "break off" where here
   the Greek has "break down" (or thoroughly), perfective use of [kata].

   9:17 Twelve baskets [kophinoi dOdeka]. For discussion of [kophonoi] and
   [sphurides] as well as of [klasmata] (broken pieces) see on Mr 6:43; Mt
   14:20).

   9:18 As he was praying [en tOi einai auton proseuchomenon]. Common
   Lukan idiom of [en] with the articular infinitive for a temporal
   clause, only here Luke has the periphrastic infinitive [einai
   proseuchomenon] as also in 11:1. This item about Christ's praying alone
   in Luke. Alone [kata monas]. In the N.T. only here and Mr 4:10).
   Perhaps [chOras] (places) is to be supplied with [monas] (lonely
   places). Were with him (sunesan autOi]. This seems like a contradiction
   unless "alone" is to be taken with [sunesan]. Westcott and Hort put
   [sunentesan] in the margin. This would mean that as Jesus was praying
   alone, the disciples fell in with him. At any rate he was praying apart
   from them.

   9:19 That I am [me einai]. Accusative and infinitive in indirect
   assertion, a common Greek idiom. Mt 16:13 for "I" has "the Son of man"
   as identical in the consciousness of Christ. The various opinions of
   men about Jesus here run parallel to the rumours heard by Herod (verses
   8, 9).

   9:20 But who say ye? [Humeis de tina legete;]. Note the emphatic
   proleptical position of [humeis\: "But ye who do ye say? This is really
   what mattered now with Jesus. The Christ of God [Ton christon tou
   theou]. The accusative though the infinitive is not expressed. The
   Anointed of God, the Messiah of God. See on 2:26 for "the Anointed of
   the Lord." See on Mt 16:17 for discussion of Peter's testimony in full.
   Mr 6:29 has simply "the Christ." It is clear from the previous
   narrative that this is not a new discovery from Simon Peter, but simply
   the settled conviction of the disciples after all the defections of the
   Galilean masses and the hostility of the Jerusalem ecclesiastics. The
   disciples still believed in Jesus as the Messiah of Jewish hope and
   prophecy. It will become plain that they do not grasp the spiritual
   conception of the Messiah and his kingdom that Jesus taught, but they
   are clear that he is the Messiah however faulty their view of the
   Messiah may be. There was comfort in this for Jesus. They were loyal to
   him.

   9:21 To tell this to no man [medeni legein touto]. Indirect command
   with the negative infinitive after commanded [pareggeilen]. It had been
   necessary for Jesus to cease using the word Messiah [Christos] about
   himself because of the political meaning to the Jews. Its use by the
   disciples would lead to revolution as was plain after the feeding of
   the five thousand (Joh 6:15).

   9:22 Rejected [apodokimasthenai]. First aorist passive infinitive of
   [apodokimazO], to reject after trial. The third day [tei tritei
   hemerai]. Locative case of time as in Mt 16:21. Here in the parallel
   passage Mr 8:31 has "after three days" [meta treis hemeras] in
   precisely the same sense. That is to say, "after three days" is just a
   free way of saying "on the third day" and cannot mean "on the fourth
   day" if taken too literally. For discussion of this plain prediction of
   the death of Christ with various details see discussion on Mt 16:21; Mr
   8:31. It was a melancholy outlook that depressed the disciples as Mark
   and Matthew show in the protest of Peter and his rebuke.

   9:23 He said unto all [elegen de pros pantas]. This is like Luke (cf.
   verse 43). Jesus wanted all (the multitude with his disciples, as Mr
   8:34 has it) to understand the lesson of self-sacrifice. They could not
   yet understand the full meaning of Christ's words as applied to his
   approaching death of which he had been speaking. But certainly the
   shadow of the cross is already across the path of Jesus as he is here
   speaking. For details (soul, life, forfeit, gain, profit, lose, world)
   see discussion on Mt 16:24-26; Mr 8:34-37. The word for lose
   [apolesei], from [apollumi], a very common verb) is used in the sense
   of destroy, kill, lose, as here. Note the mercantile terms in this
   passage (gain, lose, fine or forfeit, exchange). Daily [kath' hemeran].
   Peculiar to Luke in this incident. Take up the cross (his own cross)
   daily (aorist tense, [aratO], but keep on following me [akoloutheitO],
   present tense). The cross was a familiar figure in Palestine. It was
   rising before Jesus as his destiny. Each man has his own cross to meet
   and bear.

   9:26 Whosoever shall be ashamed [hos an epaischunthei]. Rather,
   Whosoever is ashamed as in Mr 8:38. The first aorist passive
   subjunctive in an indefinite relative clause with [an]. The passive
   verb is transitive here also. This verb is from [epi] and [aischune],
   shame (in the eyes of men). Jesus endured the shame of the cross (Heb
   12:2). The man at the feast who had to take a lower seat did it with
   shame (Lu 14:9). Paul is not ashamed of the Gospel (Ro 1:16).
   Onesiphorus was not ashamed of Paul (2Ti 1:16). In his own glory [en
   tei doxei autou]. This item added to what is in Mr 8:38; Mt 16:27.

   9:27 Till they see [heOs an idOsin]. Second aorist active subjunctive
   with [heOs] and [an] referring to the future, an idiomatic
   construction. So in Mr 9:1; Mt 16:28. In all three passages "shall not
   taste of death" [ou me geusOntai thanatou], double negative with aorist
   middle subjunctive) occurs also. Rabbinical writings use this figure.
   Like a physician Christ tasted death that we may see how to die. Jesus
   referred to the cross as "this cup" (Mr 14:36; Mt 26:39; Lu 22:42).
   Mark speaks of the kingdom of God as "come" [eleluthuian], second
   perfect active participle). Matthew as "coming" [erchomenon] referring
   to the Son of man, while Luke has neither form. See Matthew and Mark
   for discussion of the theories of interpretation of this difficult
   passage. The Transfiguration follows in a week and may be the first
   fulfilment in the mind of Jesus. It may also symbolically point to the
   second coming.

   9:28 About eight days [hOsei hemerai oktO]. A nominativus pendens
   without connexion or construction. Mr 9:2 (Mt 17:1) has "after six
   days" which agrees with the general statement. Into the mountain [eis
   to oros]. Probably Mount Hermon because we know that Jesus was near
   Caesarea Philippi when Peter made the confession (Mr 8:27; Mt 16:13).
   Hermon is still the glory of Palestine from whose heights one can view
   the whole of the land. It was a fit place for the Transfiguration. To
   pray [proseuxasthai]. Peculiar to Luke who so often mentions Christ's
   habit of prayer (cf. 3:21). See also verse 29 "as he was praying" [en
   tOi proseuchesthai], one of Luke's favourite idioms). His countenance
   was altered [egeneto to eidos tou prosOpou autou heteron]. Literally,
   "the appearance of his face became different." Mt 17:2 says that "his
   face did shine as the sun." Luke does not use the word "transfigured"
   [metemorphOthe] in Mr 9:2; Mt 17:2. He may have avoided this word
   because of the pagan associations with this word as Ovid's
   [Metamorphoses]. And his raiment became white and dazzling [kai ho
   himatismos autou leukos exastraptOn]. Literally, And his raiment white
   radiant. There is no and between "white" and "dazzling." The participle
   [exastraptOn] is from the compound verb meaning to flash [astraptO] out
   or forth [ex]. The simple verb is common for lightning flashes and
   bolts, but the compound in the LXX and here alone in the N.T. See Mr
   9:3 "exceeding white" and Mt 17:2 "white as the light."

   9:31 There talked with him [sunelaloun autOi]. Imperfect active, were
   talking with him. Who appeared in glory [hoi ophthentes en doxei].
   First aorist passive participle of [horaO]. This item peculiar to Luke.
   Compare verse 26. Spake of his decease [elegon ten exodon]. Imperfect
   active, were talking about his [exodus] (departure from earth to
   heaven) very much like our English word "decease" (Latin decessus, a
   going away). The glorious light graphically revealed Moses and Elijah
   talking with Jesus about the very subject concerning which Peter had
   dared to rebuke Jesus for mentioning (Mr 8:32; Mt 16:22). This very
   word [exodus] (way out) in the sense of death occurs in 2Pe 1:15 and is
   followed by a brief description of the Transfiguration glory. Other
   words for death [thanatos] in the N.T. are [ekbasis], going out as
   departure (Heb 13:7), [aphixis], departing (Ac 20:29), [analusis],
   loosening anchor (2Ti 4:6) and [analusai] (Php 1:23). To accomplish
   [pleroun]. To fulfil. Moses had led the Exodus from Egypt. Jesus will
   accomplish the exodus of God's people into the Promised Land on high.
   See on Mark and Matthew for discussion of significance of the
   appearance of Moses and Elijah as representatives of law and prophecy
   and with a peculiar death. The purpose of the Transfiguration was to
   strengthen the heart of Jesus as he was praying long about his
   approaching death and to give these chosen three disciples a glimpse of
   his glory for the hour of darkness coming. No one on earth understood
   the heart of Jesus and so Moses and Elijah came. The poor disciples
   utterly failed to grasp the significance of it all.

   9:32 Were heavy with sleep [esan bebaremenoi hupnOi]. Periphrastic past
   perfect of [bareO], a late form for the ancient [barunO] (not in N.T.
   save Textus Receptus in Lu 21:34). This form, rare and only in passive
   (present, aorist, perfect) in the N.T., is like [barunO], from [barus],
   and that from [baros], weight, burden (Ga 6:2). [HupnOi] is in the
   instrumental case. They had apparently climbed the mountain in the
   early part of the night and were now overcome with sleep as Jesus
   prolonged his prayer. Luke alone tells of their sleep. The same word is
   used of the eyes of these three disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane
   (Mt 26:43) and of the hearts of many (Lu 21:34). But when they were
   fully awake [diagregoresantes de]. First aorist active participle of
   this late (Herodian) and rare compound verb (here alone in the N.T.),
   [diagregoreO] (Luke is fond of compounds with [dia]. The simple verb
   [gregoreO] (from the second perfect active [egregora] is also late, but
   common in the LXX and the N.T. The effect of [dia] can be either to
   remain awake in spite of desire to sleep (margin of Revised Version) or
   to become thoroughly awake (ingressive aorist tense also) as Revised
   Version has it. This is most likely correct. The Syriac Sinaitic has it
   "When they awoke." Certainly they had been through a strain. His glory
   [ten doxan autou]. See also verse 26 in the words of Jesus.

   9:33 As they were departing from him [en tOi diachOrizesthai autous ap'
   autou]. Peculiar to Luke and another instance of Luke's common idiom of
   [en] with the articular infinitive in a temporal clause. This common
   verb occurs here only in the N.T. The present middle voice means to
   separate oneself fully (direct middle). This departing of Moses and
   Elijah apparently accompanied Peter's remark as given in all three
   Gospels. See for details on Mark and Matthew. Master [Epistata] here,
   Rabbi (Mr 9:5), Lord [Kurie], Mt 17:4). Let us make [poiesOmen], first
   aorist active subjunctive) as in Mr 9:5, but Mt 17:4 has "I will make"
   [poiesO]. It was near the time of the feast of the tabernacles. So
   Peter proposes that they celebrate it up here instead of going to
   Jerusalem for it as they did a bit later (Joh 7). Not knowing what he
   said [me eidOs ho legei]. Literally, not understanding what he was
   saying [me], regular negative with participle and [legei], present
   indicative retained in relative clause in indirect discourse). Luke
   puts it more bluntly than Mark (Peter's account), "For he wist not what
   to answer; for they became sore afraid" (Mr 9:6). Peter acted according
   to his impulsive nature and spoke up even though he did not know what
   to say or even what he was saying when he spoke. He was only half awake
   as Luke explains and he was sore afraid as Mark (Peter) explains. He
   had bewilderment enough beyond a doubt, but it was Peter who spoke, not
   James and John.

   9:34 Overshadowed them [epeskiazen autous]. Imperfect active (aorist in
   Mt 17:5) as present participle in Mr 9:7, inchoative, the shadow began
   to come upon them. On Hermon as on many high mountains a cloud will
   swiftly cover the cap. I have seen this very thing at Blue Ridge, North
   Carolina. This same verb is used of the Holy Spirit upon Mary (Lu
   1:35). Nowhere else in the N.T., though an old verb [epi, skiazO], from
   [skia], shadow). As they entered into the cloud [en tOi eiselthein
   autous eis ten nephelen]. Luke's idiom of [en] with the articular
   infinitive again (aorist active this time, on the entering in as to
   them). All six "entered into" the cloud, but only Peter, James, and
   John "became afraid" [ephobethesan], ingressive first aorist passive).

   9:35 If [ekeinous] be accepted here instead of [autous], the three
   disciples would be outside of the cloud. Out of the cloud [ek tes
   nepheles]. This voice was the voice of the Father like that at the
   baptism of Jesus (Lu 3:22; Mr 1:11; Mt 3:17) and like that near the end
   (Joh 12:28-30) when the people thought it was a clap of thunder or an
   angel. My son, my chosen [Ho huios mou, ho eklelegmenos]. So the best
   documents (Aleph B L Syriac Sinaitic). The others make it "My Beloved"
   as in Mr 9:7; Mt 17:5. These disciples are commanded to hear Jesus,
   God's Son, even when he predicts his death, a pointed rebuke to Simon
   Peter as to all.

   9:36 When the voice came [en toi genesthai ten phOnen]. Another example
   of Luke's idiom, this time with the second aorist middle infinitive.
   Literally, "on the coming as to the voice" (accusative of general
   reference). It does not mean that it was "after" the voice was past
   that Jesus was found alone, but simultaneously with it (ingressive
   aorist tense). Alone [monos]. Same adjective in Mr 9:8; Mt 17:8
   translated "only." Should be rendered "alone" there also. They held
   their peace [esigesan]. Ingressive aorist active of common verb
   [sigaO], became silent. In Mr 9:9; Mt 17:9, Jesus commanded them not to
   tell till His Resurrection from the dead. Luke notes that they in awe
   obeyed that command and it turns out that they finally forgot the
   lesson of this night's great experience. By and by they will be able to
   tell them, but not "in those days." Which they had seen [hOn heOrakan].
   Attraction of the relative [ha] into the case of the unexpressed
   antecedent [toutOn]. Perfect active indicative [heOrakan] with Koine
   (papyri) form for the ancient [heOrakasin] changed by analogy to the
   first aorist ending in [-an] instead of [-asin].

   9:37 On the next day [tei hexes hemerai]. Alone in Luke. It shows that
   the Transfiguration took place on the preceding night. They were come
   down [katelthontOn autOn]. Genitive absolute of second aorist active
   participle of [katerchomai], a common enough verb, but in the N.T. only
   in Luke's writings save Jas 3:15. Met him [sunentesen autOi]. First
   aorist active of [sunantaO], common compound verb, to meet with, only
   in Luke's writings in the N.T. save Heb 7:1. With associative
   instrumental case [autOi].

   9:38 Master [Didaskale]. Teacher as in Mr 9:17. Lord [kurie], Mt
   17:15). To look upon [epiblepsai]. Aorist active infinitive of
   [epiblepO] [epi], upon, [blepO], look), common verb, but in the N.T.
   only here and Jas 2:3 except Lu 1:48 in quotation from LXX. This
   compound verb is common in medical writers for examining carefully the
   patient. Mine only child [monogenes moi]. Only in Luke as already about
   an only child in 7:12; 8:42.

   9:39 Suddenly [exephnes]. Old adverb, but in the N.T. only in Luke's
   writings save Mr 13:36. Used by medical writers of sudden attacks of
   disease like epilepsy. It teareth him that he foameth [sparassei auton
   meta aphrou]. Literally, "It tears him with (accompanied with, [meta]
   foam" (old word, [aphros], only here in the N.T.). From [sparassO], to
   convulse, a common verb, but in the N.T. only here and Mr 1:26; 9:26
   (and [sunsparassO], Mr 9:20). See Mr 9:17; Mt 17:15; Lu 9:39 for
   variations in the symptoms in each Gospel. The use of [meta aphrou] is
   a medical item. Hardly [molis]. Late word used in place of [mogis], the
   old Greek term (in some MSS. here) and alone in Luke's writings in the
   N.T. save 1Pe 4:18; Ro 5:7. Bruising him sorely [suntribon auton].
   Common verb for rubbing together, crushing together like chains (Mr
   5:4) or as a vase (Mr 14:3). See on Matthew and Mark for discussion of
   details here.

   9:41 How long shall I be with you and bear with you? [heOs pote esomai
   pros humas kai anexomai humOn;]. Here the two questions of Mr 9:19
   (only one in Mt 17:17) are combined in one sentence. Bear with
   [anexomai], direct middle future) is, hold myself from you (ablative
   case [humOn]. Faithless [apistos] is disbelieving and perverse
   [diestrammene], perfect passive participle of [diastrephO], is twisted,
   turned, or torn in two.

   9:42 As he was yet a coming [eti proserchomenou autou]. Genitive
   absolute. While he was yet coming (the boy, that is, not Jesus). Note
   quaint English "a coming" retained in the Revised Version. Dashed him
   [errexen auton]. First aorist active indicative of [regnumi] or
   [ressO], to rend or convulse, a common verb, used sometimes of boxers
   giving knockout blows. Tare grievously [sunesparaxen]. Rare word as
   only here and Mr 9:20 in the N.T., which see. Gave him back to his
   father [apedOken auton tOi patri autou]. Tender touch alone in Luke as
   in 7:15. They were all astonished [exeplessonto de pantes]. Imperfect
   passive of the common verb [ekplessO] or [ekplegnumi], to strike out, a
   picturesque description of the amazement of all at the easy victory of
   Jesus where the nine disciples had failed. At the majesty of God [epi
   tei megaleioteti tou theou]. A late word from the adjective [megaleios]
   and that from [megas] (great). In the N.T. only here and Ac 19:27 of
   Artemis and in 2Pe 1:16 of the Transfiguration. It came to be used by
   the emperors like our word "Majesty." Which he did [hois epoiei]. This
   is one of the numerous poor verse divisions. This sentence has nothing
   to do with the first part of the verse. The imperfect active [epoiei]
   covers a good deal not told by Luke (see Mr 9:30; Mt 17:22). Note the
   attraction of the relative hois into the case of pasin, its antecedent.

   9:44 Sink into your ears [Thesthe humeis eis ta Ota humOn]. Second
   aorist imperative middle of [tithemi], common verb. "Do you (note
   emphatic position) yourselves (whatever others do) put into your ears."
   No word like "sink" here. The same prediction here as in Mr 9:31; Mt
   17:22 about the Son of man only without mention of death and
   resurrection as there, which see for discussion.

   9:45 It was concealed from them [en parakekalummenon ap' autOn].
   Periphrastic past perfect of [parakaluptO], a common verb, but only
   here in the N.T., to cover up, to hide from. This item only in Luke.
   That they should not perceive it [hina me aisthOntai auto]. Second
   aorist middle subjunctive of the common verb [aisthanomai] used with
   [hina me], negative purpose. This explanation at least relieves the
   disciples to some extent of full responsibility for their ignorance
   about the death of Jesus as Mr 9:32 observes, as does Luke here that
   they were afraid to ask him. Plummer says, "They were not allowed to
   understand the saying then, in order that they might remember it
   afterwards, and see that Jesus had met His sufferings with full
   knowledge and free will." Perhaps also, if they had fully understood,
   they might have lacked courage to hold on to the end. But it is a hard
   problem.

   9:46 A reasoning [dialogismos]. A dispute. The word is from
   [dialogizomai], the verb used in Mr 9:33 about this incident. In Luke
   this dispute follows immediately after the words of Jesus about his
   death. They were afraid to ask Jesus about that subject, but Mt 18:1
   states that they came to Jesus to settle it. Which of them should be
   greatest [to tis an eie meizOn autOn]. Note the article with the
   indirect question, the clause being in the accusative of general
   reference. The optative with [an] is here because it was so in the
   direct question (potential optative with [an] retained in the
   indirect). But Luke makes it plain that it was not an abstract problem
   about greatness in the kingdom of heaven as they put it to Jesus (Mt
   18:1), but a personal problem in their own group. Rivalries and
   jealousies had already come and now sharp words. By and by James and
   John will be bold enough to ask for the first places for themselves in
   this political kingdom which they expect (Mr 10:35; Mt 20:20). It is a
   sad spectacle.

   9:47 Took a little child [epilabomenos paidion]. Second aorist middle
   participle of the common verb [epilambanO]. Strictly, Taking a little
   child to himself (indirect middle). Mr 9:36 has merely the active
   [labOn] of the simple verb [lambanO]. Set him by his side [estesen auto
   par' heautOi]. "In his arms" Mr 9:36 has it, "in the midst of them" Mt
   18:3 says. All three attitudes following one another (the disciples
   probably in a circle around Jesus anyhow) and now the little child
   (Peter's child?) was slipped down by the side of Jesus as he gave the
   disciples an object lesson in humility which they sorely needed.

   9:48 This little child [touto to paidion]. As Jesus spoke he probably
   had his hand upon the head of the child. Mt 18:5 has "one such little
   child." The honoured disciple, Jesus holds, is the one who welcomes
   little children "in my name" [epi tOi onomati mou], upon the basis of
   my name and my authority. It was a home-thrust against the selfish
   ambition of the Twelve. Ministry to children is a mark of greatness.
   Have preachers ever yet learned how to win children to Christ? They are
   allowed to slip away from home, from Sunday school, from church, from
   Christ. For he that is least among you all [ho gar mikroteros en pasin
   humin huparchOn]. Note the use of [huparchO] as in 8:41; 23:50). The
   comparative [mikroteros] is in accord with the Koine idiom where the
   superlative is vanishing (nearly gone in modern Greek). But great
   [megas] is positive and very strong. This saying peculiar to Luke here.

   9:49 And John answered [apokritheis de IOanes]. As if John wanted to
   change the subject after the embarrassment of the rebuke for their
   dispute concerning greatness (Lu 9:46-48). Master [epistata]. Only in
   Luke in the N.T. as already four times (5:5; 8:24, 45; 9:33). We
   forbade him [ekOluomen auton]. Conative imperfect as in Mr 9:38, We
   tried to hinder him. Because he followeth not with us [hoti ouk
   akolouthei meth hemOn]. Present tense preserved for vividness where
   Mark has imperfect ekolouthei. Note also here "with us" [meth' hemOn]
   where Mark has associative instrumental [hemin]. It is a pitiful
   specimen of partisan narrowness and pride even in the Beloved Disciple,
   one of the Sons of Thunder. The man was doing the Master's work in the
   Master's name and with the Master's power, but did not run with the
   group of the Twelve.

   9:50 "Against you is for you" [kath' h-mOn huper h-mOn]. Mr 9:40 has
   "against us is for us" [hemOn ... hemOn]. The Koine Greek [e] and [-]
   were often pronounced alike and it was easy to interchange them. So
   many MSS. here read just as in Mark. The point is precisely the same as
   it is a proverbial saying. See a similar saying in Lu 11:23: "He that
   is not with me is against me." The prohibition here as in Mr 9:39 is
   general: "Stop hindering him" [me kOluete, me] and the present
   imperative, not [me] and the aorist subjunctive). The lesson of
   toleration in methods of work for Christ is needed today.

   9:51 When the days were well-nigh come [en tOi sumplerousthai tas
   hemeras]. Luke's common idiom [en] with the articular infinitive, "in
   the being fulfilled as to the days." This common compound occurs in the
   N.T. only here and Lu 8:23; Ac 2:1. The language here makes it plain
   that Jesus was fully conscious of the time of his death as near as
   already stated (Lu 9:22,27,31). That he should be received up [tes
   analempseOs autou]. Literally, "of his taking up." It is an old word
   (from Hippocrates on), but here alone in the N.T. It is derived from
   [analambanO] (the verb used of the Ascension, Ac 1:2,11,22; 1Ti 3:16)
   and refers here to the Ascension of Jesus after His Resurrection. Not
   only in John's Gospel (Joh 17:5) does Jesus reveal a yearning for a
   return to the Father, but it is in the mind of Christ here as evidently
   at the Transfiguration (9:31) and later in Lu 12:49f. He steadfastly
   set his face [autos to prosOpon esterisen]. Note emphatic [autos], he
   himself, with fixedness of purpose in the face of difficulty and
   danger. This look on Christ's face as he went to his doom is noted
   later in Mr 10:32. It is a Hebraistic idiom (nine times in Ezekiel),
   this use of face here, but the verb (effective aorist active) is an old
   one from [sterizO] (from [sterigx], a support), to set fast, to fix. To
   go to Jerusalem [tou poreuesthai eis Ierousalem]. Genitive infinitive
   of purpose. Luke three times mentions Christ making his way to
   Jerusalem (9:51; 13:22; 17:11) and John mentions three journeys to
   Jerusalem during the later ministry (Joh 7:10; 11:17; 12:1). It is
   natural to take these journeys to be the same in each of these Gospels.
   Luke does not make definite location of each incident and John merely
   supplements here and there. But in a broad general way they seem to
   correspond.

   9:52 Sent messengers [apesteilen aggelous]. As a precaution since he
   was going to Jerusalem through Samaria. The Samaritans did not object
   when people went north from Jerusalem through their country. He was
   repudiating Mount Gerizim by going by it to Jerusalem. This was an
   unusual precaution by Jesus and we do not know who the messengers
   (angels) were. To make ready for him [hOs hetoimasai autOi]. [HOs] is
   correct here, not [hOste]. The only examples of the final use of [hOs]
   with the infinitive in the N.T. are this one and Heb 7:9 (absolute
   use). In Acts 20:24 Westcott and Hort read [hOs teleiOsO] and put [hOs
   teleiOsai] in the margin (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1091).

   9:53 And they did not receive him [kai ouk edexanto auton]. Adversative
   use of [kai] = But. Because his face was going to Jerusalem [hoti to
   prosOpon autou en poreuomenon eis Ierousalem]. Periphrastic imperfect
   middle. It was reason enough to the churlish Samaritans.

   9:54 Saw this [idontes]. Second aorist active participle of [horaO].
   Saw the messengers returning. We bid [theleis eipOmen]. Deliberative
   subjunctive [eipOmen] after [theleis] without [hina], probably two
   questions, Dost thou wish? Shall we bid? Perhaps the recent appearance
   of Elijah on the Mount of Transfiguration reminded James and John of
   the incident in 2Ki 1:10-12. Some MSS. add here "as Elijah did." The
   language of the LXX is quoted by James and John, these fiery Sons of
   Thunder. Note the two aorist active infinitives [katabenai, analOsai],
   the first ingressive, the second effective).

   9:55 But he turned [strapheis de]. Second aorist passive participle of
   [strephO], common verb, to turn round. Dramatic act. Some ancient MSS.
   have here: Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of [ouk oidate
   poiou pneumatos este]. This sounds like Christ and may be a genuine
   saying though not a part of Luke's Gospel. A smaller number of MSS. add
   also: For the Son of Man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save
   them [Ho gar huios tou anthrOpou ouk elthen psuchas anthrOpOn apolesai
   alla sOsai], a saying reminding us of Mt 5:17; Lu 19:10). Certain it is
   that here Jesus rebuked the bitterness of James and John toward
   Samaritans as he had already chided John for his narrowness towards a
   fellow-worker in the kingdom.

   9:57 A certain man [tis]. Mt 8:19 calls him "a scribe." Lu 9:57-60; Mt
   8:19-22, but not in Mark and so from Q or the Logia. Wherever you go
   [hopou ean aperchei] is the present middle subjunctive with the
   indefinite relative adverb [ean], common Greek idiom. See on Matthew
   for "holes," "nests," "Son of man." The idiom "where to lay his head"
   [pou ten kephalen klinei] is the same in both, the deliberative
   subjunctive retained in the indirect question. "Jesus knows the measure
   of the scribe's enthusiasm" (Plummer). The wandering life of Jesus
   explains this statement.

   9:59 And he said unto another [eipen de pros heteron]. Mt 8:21 omits
   Christ's "Follow me" [akolouthei moi] and makes this man a volunteer
   instead of responding to the appeal of Jesus. There is no real
   opposition, of course. In Matthew's account the man is apologetic as in
   Luke. Plummer calls him "one of the casual disciples" of whom there are
   always too many. The scribes knew how to give plausible reasons for not
   being active disciples. First [prOton]. One of the problems of life is
   the relation of duties to each other, which comes first. The burial of
   one's father was a sacred duty (Ge 25:9), but, as in the case of Tobit
   4:3, this scribe's father probably was still alive. What the scribe
   apparently meant was that he could not leave his father while still
   alive to follow Jesus around over the country.

   9:60 Leave the dead to bury their own dead [aphes tous nekrous thapsai
   tous heautOn nekrous]. This paradox occurs so in Mt 8:22. The
   explanation is that the spiritually dead can bury the literally dead.
   For such a quick change in the use of the same words see Joh 5:21-29
   (spiritual resurrection from sin in Joh 5:21-27, bodily resurrection
   from the grave, Joh 5:28, 29) and Joh 11:25f. The harshness of this
   proverb to the scribe probably is due to the fact that he was
   manifestly using his aged father as an excuse for not giving Christ
   active service. But go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God [su
   de apelthOn diaggelle ten basileian tou theou]. The scribe's duty is
   put sharply [But do thou, su de]. Christ called him to preach, and he
   was using pious phrases about his father as a pretext. Many a preacher
   has had to face a similar delicate problem of duty to father, mother,
   brothers, sisters and the call to preach. This was a clear case. Jesus
   will help any man called to preach to see his duty. Certainly Jesus
   does not advocate renunciation of family duties on the part of
   preachers.

   9:61 And another also said [eipen de kai heteros]. A volunteer like the
   first. This third case is given by Luke alone, though the incident may
   also come from the same Logia as the other two. [Heteros] does not here
   mean one of a "different" sort as is sometimes true of this pronoun,
   but merely another like [allos] (Robertson, Grammar, p. 749). But first
   [prOton de]. He also had something that was to come "first." To bid
   farewell to them that are at my house [apotaxasthai tois eis ton oikon
   mou]. In itself that was a good thing to do. This first aorist middle
   infinitive is from [apotassO], an old verb, to detach, to separate, to
   assign as a detachment of soldiers. In the N.T. it only appears in the
   middle voice with the meaning common in late writers to bid adieu, to
   separate oneself from others. It is used in Ac 18:18 of Paul taking
   leave of the believers in Corinth. See also Mr 6:46; 2Co 2:13. It is
   thus a formal function and this man meant to go home and set things in
   order there and then in due time to come and follow Jesus.

   9:62 Having put his hand to the plough [epibalOn ten cheira ep'
   arotron]. Second aorist active participle of [epiballO], an old and
   common verb, to place upon. Note repetition of preposition [epi] before
   [arotron] (plough). This agricultural proverb is as old as Hesiod.
   Pliny observes that the ploughman who does not bend attentively to his
   work goes crooked. It has always been the ambition of the ploughman to
   run a straight furrow. The Palestine fellah had good success at it. And
   looking back [kai blepOn eis ta opisO]. Looking to the things behind.
   To do that is fatal as any ploughman knows. The call to turn back is
   often urgent. Fit [euthetos]. From [eu] and [tithemi] = well-placed,
   suited for, adapted to. "The first case is that of inconsiderate
   impulse, the second that of conflicting duties, the third that of a
   divided mind" (Bruce).
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 10

   10:1 Appointed [anedeixen]. First aorist active indicative of
   [anadeiknumi], an old verb, not only common, but in LXX. In the N.T.
   only here and Ac 1:24. Cf. [anadeixis] in Lu 1:80). To show forth,
   display, proclaim, appoint. Seventy others [heterous hebdomekonta kai].
   The "also" [kai] and the "others" point back to the mission of the
   Twelve in Galilee (9:1-6). Some critics think that Luke has confused
   this report of a mission in Judea with that in Galilee, but needlessly
   so. What earthly objection can there be to two similar missions? B D
   Syr. Cur. and Syr. Sin. have "seventy-two." The seventy elders were
   counted both ways and the Sanhedrin likewise and the nations of the
   earth. It is an evenly balanced point. Two and two [ana duo]. For
   companionship as with the Twelve though Mr 6:7 has it [duo] (vernacular
   idiom). B K have here [ana duo], a combination of the idiom in Mr 6:7
   and that here. He himself was about to come [emellen autos erchesthai].
   Imperfect of [mellO] with present infinitive and note [autos]. Jesus
   was to follow after and investigate the work done. This was only a
   temporary appointment and no names are given, but they could cover a
   deal of territory.

   10:2 Harvest [therismos]. Late word for the older [theros], summer,
   harvest. The language in this verse is verbatim what we have in Mt
   9:37,38 to the Twelve. Why not? The need is the same and prayer is the
   answer in each case. Prayer for preachers is Christ's method for
   increasing the supply.

   10:3 As lambs [hOs arnas]. Here again the same language as that in Mt
   10:16 except that there "sheep" [probata] appears instead of "lambs."
   Pathetic picture of the risks of missionaries for Christ. They take
   their life in their hands.

   10:4 Purse [ballantion]. Old word for money-bag, sometimes a javelin as
   if from [ballO]. Only in Luke in the N.T. (10:4; 12:33; 22:35ff.). See
   Lu 9:3; Mr 6:7f.; Mt 10:9f. for the other similar items. Salute no man
   on the way [medena kata ten hodon aspasesthe]. First aorist
   (ingressive) middle subjunctive with [medena]. The peril of such
   wayside salutations was palaver and delay. The King's business required
   haste. Elisha's servant was not to tarry for salutations or salaams
   (2Ki 4:29). These oriental greetings were tedious, complicated, and
   often meddlesome if others were present or engaged in a bargain.

   10:5 First say [prOton legete]. Say first. The adverb [prOton] can be
   construed with "enter" [eiselthete], but probably with [legete] is
   right. The word spoken is the usual oriental salutation.

   10:6 A son of peace [huios eirenes]. A Hebraism, though some examples
   occur in the vernacular Koine papyri. It means one inclined to peace,
   describing the head of the household. Shall rest [epanapaesetai].
   Second future passive of [epanapauO], a late double compound [epi, ana]
   of the common verb [pauO]. It shall turn to you again [eph' humas
   anakampsei]. Common verb [anakamptO], to bend back, return. The peace
   in that case will bend back with blessing upon the one who spoke it.

   10:7 In that same house [en autei tei oikiai]. Literally, in the house
   itself, not "in the same house" [en tei autei oikiai], a different
   construction. A free rendering of the common Lukan idiom is, "in that
   very house." Eating [esthontes]. An old poetic verb [esthO] for
   [esthiO] that survives in late Greek. Such things as they give [ta par'
   autOn]. "The things from them." For the labourer is worthy of his hire
   [axios gar ho ergates tou misthou autou]. In Mt 10:10 we have [tes
   trophes autou] (his food). 1Ti 5:18 has this saying quoted as
   scripture. That is not impossible if Luke wrote by A.D. 62. Paul there
   however may quote only De 25:4 as scripture and get this quotation
   either from Lu 10:7 or from a proverbial saying of Jesus. It is
   certainly not a real objection against the Pauline authorship of First
   Timothy. Go not from house to house [me metabainete ex oikias eis
   oikian]. As a habit, [me] and the present imperative, and so avoid
   waste of time with such rounds of invitations as would come.

   10:8 Such things as are set before you [ta paratithemena humin]. The
   things placed before you from time to time (present passive participle,
   repetition). Every preacher needs this lesson of common politeness.
   These directions may seem perfunctory and even commonplace, but every
   teacher of young preachers knows how necessary they are. Hence they
   were given both to the Twelve and to the Seventy.

   10:9 Is come nigh unto you [eggiken eph' humas]. Perfect active
   indicative of [eggizO] as in Mt 3:2 of the Baptist and Mr 1:15 of
   Jesus. Note [eph' humas] here.

   10:10 Into the streets thereof [eis tas plateias autes]. Out of the
   inhospitable houses into the broad open streets.

   10:11 Even the dust [kai ton koniorton]. Old word from [konis], dust,
   and [ornumi], to stir up. We have seen it already in Mt 10:14; Lu 9:5.
   Dust is a plague in the east. Shake off even that. Cleaveth
   [kollethenta]. First aorist passive participle of [kollaO], to cling as
   dust and mud do to shoes. Hence the orientals took off the sandals on
   entering a house. We wipe off [apomassometha]. Middle voice of an old
   verb [apomassO], to rub off with the hands. Nowhere else in the N.T.
   But [ekmassO], occurs in Lu 7:38,44. Against you [Humin]. Fine example
   of the dative of disadvantage (the case of personal interest, the
   dative).

   10:12 More tolerable [anektoteron]. Comparative of the verbal adjective
   [anektos] from [anechomai]. An old adjective, but only the comparative
   in the N.T. and in this phrase (Mt 10:15; 11:22, 24; Lu 10:12, 14).

   10:13 Would have repented [an metenoesan]. Conclusion (apodosis) of
   second-class condition, determined as unfulfilled. Long ago [palai].
   Implies a considerable ministry in these cities of which we are not
   told. Chorazin not mentioned save here and Mt 11:21. Perhaps [Karazeh]
   near Tell Hum (Capernaum). Sitting in sackcloth and ashes [en sakkOi
   kai spodoi kathemenoi]. Pictorial and graphic. The [sakkos] (sackcloth)
   was dark coarse cloth made of goat's hair and worn by penitents,
   mourners, suppliants. It is a Hebrew word, sag.The rough cloth was used
   for sacks or bags. To cover oneself with ashes was a mode of punishment
   as well as of voluntary humiliation.

   10:15 Shalt thou be exalted? [me hupsOthesei;]. [Me] expects the answer
   No. The verb is future passive indicative second singular of [hupsoO],
   to lift up, a late verb from [hupsos], height. It is used by Jesus of
   the Cross (Joh 12:32). Unto Hades [heOs Haidou]. See on Mt 16:18 for
   this word which is here in contrast to Heaven as in Isa 14:13-15. Hades
   is not Gehenna. "The desolation of the whole neighbourhood, and the
   difficulty of identifying even the site of these flourishing towns, is
   part of the fulfilment of this prophecy" (Plummer). Ragg notes the
   omission of Nazareth from this list of cities of neglected privilege
   and opportunity. "Is it the tender memories of boyhood that keep from
   His lips the name of the arch-rejector (4:28 sqq.) Nazareth?"

   10:16 Rejecteth him that sent me [athetei ton aposteilanta me]. These
   solemn words form a fit close for this discourse to the Seventy. The
   fate of Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum will befall those who set aside
   [a] privative and [theteO], from [tithemi] the mission and message of
   these messengers of Christ. See this verb used in 7:30 of the attitude
   of the scribes and Pharisees toward John and Jesus. It is this thought
   that makes it so grave a responsibility to be co-workers with Christ,
   high privilege as it is (Joh 9:4).

   10:17 Returned with joy [hupestrepsan meta charas]. They had profited
   by the directions of Jesus. Joy overflows their faces and their words.
   Even the demons [kai ta daimonia]. This was a real test. The Twelve had
   been expressly endowed with this power when they were sent out (Lu
   9:1), but the Seventy were only told to heal the sick (10:9). It was
   better than they expected. The Gospel worked wonders and they were
   happy. The demons were merely one sign of the conflict between Christ
   and Satan. Every preacher has to grapple with demons in his work. Are
   subject [hupotassetai]. Present passive indicative (repetition).

   10:18 I beheld Satan fallen [etheOroun ton Satanan pesonta]. Imperfect
   active (I was beholding) and second aorist (constative) active
   participle of [piptO] (not fallen, [peptOkota], perfect active
   participle, nor falling, [piptonta], present active participle, but
   fall, [pesonta]. As a flash of lightning out of heaven, quick and
   startling, so the victory of the Seventy over the demons, the agents of
   Satan, forecast his downfall and Jesus in vision pictured it as a flash
   of lightning.

   10:19 And over all the power of the enemy [kai epi pasan ten dunamin
   tou echthrou]. This is the heart of "the authority" [ten exousian] here
   given by Jesus which is far beyond their expectations. The victory over
   demons was one phase of it. The power to tread upon serpents is
   repeated in Mr 16:18 (the Appendix) and exemplified in Paul's case in
   Malta (Ac 28:3-5). But protection from physical harm is not the main
   point in this struggle with Satan "the enemy" (Mt 13:25; Ro 16:20; 1Pe
   5:8). Nothing shall in any wise hurt you [ouden humas ou me adikesei].
   Text has future active indicative, while some MSS. read [adikesei],
   aorist active subjunctive of [adikeO], common verb from [adikos] [a]
   privative and [dikos], to suffer wrong, to do wrong. The triple
   negative here is very strong. Certainly Jesus does not mean this
   promise to create presumption or foolhardiness for he repelled the
   enemy's suggestion on the pinnacle of the temple.

   10:20 Are written [engegraptai]. Perfect passive indicative, state of
   completion, stand written, enrolled or engraved, from [engraphO],
   common verb. "As citizens possessing the full privileges of the
   commonwealth" (Plummer).

   10:21 In that same hour [en autei tei hOrai]. Literally, "at the hour
   itself," almost a demonstrative use of [autos] (Robertson, Grammar, p.
   686) and in Luke alone in the N.T. (2:38; 10:21; 12:12; 20:19). Mt
   11:25 uses the demonstrative here, "at that time" [en ekeinOi tOi
   kairOi]. Rejoiced in the Holy Spirit [egalliasato tOi pneumati tOi
   hagiOi]. First aorist middle of the late verb [agalliaO] for [agallO],
   to exult. Always in the middle in the N.T. save Lu 1:47 in Mary's
   Magnificat.This holy joy of Jesus was directly due to the Holy Spirit.
   It is joy in the work of his followers, their victories over Satan, and
   is akin to the joy felt by Jesus in Joh 4:32-38 when the vision of the
   harvest of the world stirred his heart. The rest of this verse is
   precisely like Mt 11:25f., a peculiarly Johannine passage in Matthew
   and Luke, but not in Mark, and so from Q (the Logia of Jesus). It has
   disturbed critics who are unwilling to admit the Johannine style and
   type of teaching as genuine, but here it is. See on Matthew for
   discussion. "That God had proved his independence of the human
   intellect is a matter for thankfulness. Intellectual gifts, so far from
   being necessary, are often a hindrance" (Plummer).

   10:22 Knoweth who the Son is [ginOskei tis estin ho huios]. Knows by
   experience, [ginOskei]. Here Mt 11:27 has [epiginOskei] (fully knows)
   and simply [ton huion] (the Son) instead of the "who" [tis] clause. So
   also in "who the Father is" [tis estin ho pater]. But the same use and
   contrast of "the Father," "the Son." in both Matthew and Luke, "an
   aerolite from the Johannean heaven" (Hase). No sane criticism can get
   rid of this Johannine bit in these Gospels written long before the
   Fourth Gospel was composed. We are dealing here with the oldest known
   document about Christ (the Logia) and the picture is that drawn in the
   Fourth Gospel (see my The Christ of the Logia). It is idle to try to
   whittle away by fantastic exegesis the high claims made by Jesus in
   this passage. It is an ecstatic prayer in the presence of the Seventy
   under the rapture of the Holy Spirit on terms of perfect equality and
   understanding between the Father and the Son in the tone of the
   priestly prayer in Joh 17. We are justified in saying that this prayer
   of supreme Fellowship with the Father in contemplation of final victory
   over Satan gives us a glimpse of the prayers with the Father when the
   Son spent whole nights on the mountain alone with the Father. Here is
   the Messianic consciousness in complete control and with perfect
   confidence in the outcome. Here as in Mt 11:27 by the use of willeth to
   reveal him [bouletai apokalupsai]. The Son claims the power to reveal
   the Father "to whomsoever he wills" [hOi an bouletai], indefinite
   relative and present subjunctive of [boulomai], to will, not the future
   indicative). This is divine sovereignty most assuredly. Human free
   agency is also true, but it is full divine sovereignty in salvation
   that is here claimed along with possession [paredothe], timeless aorist
   passive indicative) of all power from the Father. Let that supreme
   claim stand.

   10:23 Turning to the disciples [strapheis pros tous mathetas]. Second
   aorist passive of [strephO] as in 9:55. The prayer was a soliloquy
   though uttered in the presence of the Seventy on their return. Now
   Jesus turned and spoke "privately" or to the disciples (the Twelve,
   apparently), whether on this same occasion or a bit later. Blessed
   [makarioi]. A beatitude, the same adjective as in Mt 5:3-11. A
   beatitude of privilege very much like that in Mt 5:13-16. Jesus often
   repeated his sayings.

   10:24 Which ye see [ha humeis blepete]. The expression of [humeis]
   makes "ye" very emphatic in contrast with the prophets and kings of
   former days.

   10:25 And tempted him [ekpeirazOn auton]. Present active participle,
   conative idea, trying to tempt him. There is no "and" in the Greek. He
   "stood up [aneste], ingressive second aorist active) trying to tempt
   him." [PeirazO] is a late form of [peiraO] and [ekpeirazO] apparently
   only in the LXX, and N.T. (quoted by Jesus from De 6:16 in Mt 4:7; Lu
   4:12 against Satan). Here and 1Co 10:9. The spirit of this lawyer was
   evil. He wanted to entrap Jesus if possible. What shall I do to inherit
   eternal life? [Ti poiesas zOen aiOniou kleronomesO;]. Literally, "By
   doing what shall I inherit eternal life?" Note the emphasis on "doing"
   [poiesas]. The form of his question shows a wrong idea as to how to get
   it. Eternal life [zOen aiOnion] is endless life as in John's Gospel
   (Joh 16:9; 18:18, 30) and in Mt 25:46, which see.

   10:26 How readest thou? [pOs anaginOskeis;]. As a lawyer it was his
   business to know the facts in the law and the proper interpretation of
   the law. See on Lu 7:30 about [nomikos] (lawyer). The rabbis had a
   formula, "What readest thou?"

   10:27 And he answering [ho de apokritheis]. First aorist participle, no
   longer passive in idea. The lawyer's answer is first from the Shema (De
   6:3; 11:13) which was written on the phylacteries. The second part is
   from Le 19:18 and shows that the lawyer knew the law. At a later time
   Jesus himself in the temple gives a like summary of the law to a lawyer
   (Mr 12:28-34; Mt 22:34-40) who wanted to catch Jesus by his question.
   There is no difficulty in the two incidents. God is to be loved with
   all of man's four powers (heart, soul, strength, mind) here as in Mr
   12:30).

   10:28 Thou hast answered right [orthOs apekrithes]. First aorist
   passive indicative second singular with the adverb [orthOs]. The answer
   was correct so far as the words went. In Mr 12:34 Jesus commends the
   scribe for agreeing to his interpretation of the first and the second
   commandments. That scribe was "not far from the kingdom of God," but
   this lawyer was "tempting" Jesus. Do this and thou shalt live [touto
   poiei kai zesei]. Present imperative (keep on doing this forever) and
   the future indicative middle as a natural result. There was only one
   trouble with the lawyer's answer. No one ever did or ever can "do" what
   the law lays down towards God and man always. To slip once is to fail.
   So Jesus put the problem squarely up to the lawyer who wanted to know
   by doing what. Of course, if he kept the law perfectly always, he would
   inherit eternal life.

   10:29 Desiring to justify himself [thelOn dikaiOsai heauton]. The
   lawyer saw at once that he had convicted himself of asking a question
   that he already knew. In his embarrassment he asks another question to
   show that he did have some point at first: And who is my neighbour?
   [kai tis estin mou plesion;]. The Jews split hairs over this question
   and excluded from "neighbour" Gentiles and especially Samaritans. So
   here was his loop-hole. A neighbour is a nigh dweller to one, but the
   Jews made racial exceptions as many, alas, do today. The word [plesion]
   here is an adverb (neuter of the adjective [plesios] meaning [ho
   plesion On] (the one who is near), but [On] was usually not expressed
   and the adverb is here used as if a substantive.

   10:30 Made answer [hupolabOn]. Second aorist active participle of
   [hupolambanO] (see 7:43), to take up literally, and then in thought and
   speech, old verb, but in this sense of interrupting in talk only in the
   N.T. Was going down [katebainen]. Imperfect active describing the
   journey. Fell among robbers [leistais periepesen]. Second aorist
   ingressive active indicative of [peripiptO], old verb with associative
   instrumental case, to fall among and to be encompassed by [peri],
   around), to be surrounded by robbers. A common experience to this day
   on the road to Jericho. The Romans placed a fort on this "red and
   bloody way." These were bandits, not petty thieves. Stripped
   [ekdusantes]. Of his clothing as well as of his money, the meanest sort
   of robbers. Beat him [plegas epithentes]. Second aorist active
   participle of [epitithemi], a common verb. Literally, "placing strokes
   or blows" [plegas], plagues) upon him. See Lu 12:48; Ac 16:23; Re
   15:1,6,8 for "plagues." Half-dead [hemithane]. Late word from [hemi],
   half, and [thneskO], to die. Only here in the N.T. Vivid picture of the
   robbery.

   10:31 By chance [kata sugkurian]. Here only in the N.T., meaning
   rather, "by way of coincidence." It is a rare word elsewhere and in
   late writers like Hippocrates. It is from the verb [sugkureO], though
   [sugkuresis] is more common. Was going down [katebainen]. Imperfect
   active as in verse 30). Passed by on the other side [antiparelthen].
   Second aorist active indicative of [antiparerchomai], a late double
   compound here (verses 31, 32) only in the N.T., but in the papyri and
   late writers. It is the ingressive aorist [elthen], came alongside
   [para], and then he stepped over to the opposite side [anti] of the
   road to avoid ceremonial contamination with a stranger. A vivid and
   powerful picture of the vice of Jewish ceremonial cleanliness at the
   cost of moral principle and duty. The Levite in verse 32 behaved
   precisely as the priest had done and for the same reason.

   10:33 A certain Samaritan [Samareites de tis]. Of all men in the world
   to do a neighbourly act! As he journeyed [hodeuOn]. Making his way.
   Came where he was [elthen kat' auton]. Literally, "came down upon him."
   He did not sidestep or dodge him, but had compassion on him.

   10:34 Bound up his wounds [katedesen ta traumata]. First aorist active
   indicative of [katadeO], old verb, but here only in the N.T. The verb
   means "bound down." We say "bind up." Medical detail that interested
   Luke. The word for "wounds" [traumata] here only in the N.T. Pouring on
   them oil and wine [epicheOn elaion kai oinon]. Old verb again, but here
   only in the N.T. Oil and wine were household remedies even for wounds
   (soothing oil, antiseptic alcohol). Hippocrates prescribed for ulcers:
   "Bind with soft wool, and sprinkle with wine and oil." Set him
   [epibibasas]. An old verb [epibibazO] [epi], [bibazO], to cause to
   mount. In the N.T. only here and Ac 19:35; 23:24, common in LXX. Beast
   [ktenos]. Old word from [ktaomai], to acquire, and so property [ktema]
   especially cattle or any beast of burden. An inn [pandocheion]. The old
   Attic form was [pandokeion] (from [pan], all, and [dechomai], to
   receive). A public place for receiving all comers and a more
   pretentious caravanserai than a [kataluma] like that in Lu 2:7. Here
   only in the N.T. There are ruins of two inns about halfway between
   Bethany and Jericho.

   10:35 On the morrow [epi ten aurion]. Towards the morrow as in Ac 4:5.
   (Cf. also Ac 3:1). Syriac Sinaitic has it "at dawn of the day." An
   unusual use of [epi]. Took out [ekbalOn]. Second aorist active
   participle of [ekballO]. It could mean, "fling out," but probably only
   means "drew out." Common verb. Two pence [duo denaria]. About
   thirty-five cents, but worth more in purchasing power. To the host [tOi
   pandochei]. The innkeeper. Here only in the N.T. Whatsoever thou
   spendest more [hoti an prosdapaneseis]. Indefinite relative clause with
   [an] and the aorist active subjunctive of [prosdapanaO], to spend
   besides [pros], a late verb for the common [prosanaliskO] and here only
   in the N.T. I will repay [ego apodOsO]. Emphatic. What he had paid was
   merely by way of pledge. He was a man of his word and known to the
   innkeeper as reliable. When I come back again [en tOi epanerchesthai
   me]. Luke's favourite idiom of [en] and the articular infinitive with
   accusative of general reference. Double compound verb [epanerchomai].

   10:36 Proved neighbour to him that fell [plesion gegonenai tou
   empesontos]. Second perfect infinitive of [ginomai] and second aorist
   active participle of [empiptO]. Objective genitive, became neighbour to
   the one, etc. Jesus has changed the lawyer's standpoint and has put it
   up to him to decide which of "these three" [toutOn tOn triOn], priest,
   Levite, Samaritan) acted like a neighbour to the wounded man.

   10:37 On him [met' autou]. With him, more exactly. The lawyer saw the
   point and gave the correct answer, but he gulped at the word
   "Samaritan" and refused to say that. Do thou [su poiei]. Emphasis on
   "thou." Would this Jewish lawyer act the neighbour to a Samaritan? This
   parable of the Good Samaritan has built the world's hospitals and, if
   understood and practised, will remove race prejudice, national hatred
   and war, class jealousy.

   10:38 Now as they went on their way [en de tOi poreuesthai autous].
   Luke's favourite temporal clause again as in verse 35. Received him
   into her house [hupedexato auton eis ten oikian]. Aorist middle
   indicative of [hupodechomai], an old verb to welcome as a guest (in the
   N.T. only here and Lu 19:6; Ac 17:7; Jas 2:25). Martha is clearly the
   mistress of the home and is probably the elder sister. There is no
   evidence that she was the wife of Simon the leper (Joh 12:1f.). It is
   curious that in an old cemetery at Bethany the names of Martha,
   Eleazar, and Simon have been found.

   10:39 Which also sat [he kai parakathestheisa]. First aorist passive
   participle of [parakathezomai], an old verb, but only here in the N.T.
   It means to sit beside [para] and [pros] means right in front of the
   feet of Jesus. It is not clear what the point is in [kai] here. It may
   mean that Martha loved to sit here also as well as Mary. Heard
   [ekouen]. Imperfect active. She took her seat by the feet of Jesus and
   went on listening to his talk.

   10:40 Was cumbered [periespato]. Imperfect passive of [perispaO], an
   old verb with vivid metaphor, to draw around. One has sometimes seen
   women whose faces are literally drawn round with anxiety, with a
   permanent twist, distracted in mind and in looks. She came up to him
   [epistasa]. Second aorist active participle of [ephistemi], an old verb
   to place upon, but in the N.T. only in the middle voice or the
   intransitive tenses of the active (perfect and second aorist as here).
   It is the ingressive aorist here and really means. stepping up to or
   bursting in or upon Jesus. It is an explosive act as is the speech of
   Martha. Dost thou not care [ou melei soi]. This was a reproach to Jesus
   for monopolizing Mary to Martha's hurt. Did leave me [me kateleipen].
   Imperfect active, she kept on leaving me. Bid her [eipon autei]. Late
   form instead of [eipe], second aorist active imperative, common in the
   papyri. Martha feels that Jesus is the key to Mary's help. That she
   help me [hina moi sunantilabetai]. Sub-final use of [hina] with second
   aorist middle subjunctive of [sunantilambanomai], a double compound
   verb [sun], with, [anti], at her end of the line, and [lambanomai],
   middle voice of [lambanO], to take hold), a late compound appearing in
   the LXX, Diodorus and Josephus. Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East,
   p. 87) finds it in many widely scattered inscriptions "throughout the
   whole extent of the Hellenistic world of the Mediterranean." It appears
   only twice in the N.T. (here and Ro 8:26). It is a beautiful word, to
   take hold oneself (middle voice) at his end of the task [anti] together
   with [sun] one.

   10:41 Art anxious [merimnais]. An old verb for worry and anxiety from
   [merizO] [meris], part) to be divided, distracted. Jesus had warned
   against this in the Sermon on the Mount (Mt 6:25,28,31,34. See also Lu
   12:11,22,26). And troubled [kai thorubazei]. From [thorubazomai], a
   verb found nowhere else so far. Many MSS. here have the usual form
   [turbazei], from [turbazO]. Apparently from [thorubos], a common enough
   word for tumult. Martha had both inward anxiety and outward agitation.
   But one thing is needful [henos de estin chreia]. This is the reading
   of A C and may be correct. A few manuscripts have: "There is need of
   few things." Aleph B L (and Westcott and Hort) have: "There is need of
   few things or one," which seems like a conflate reading though the
   readings are all old. See Robertson, Introduction to Textual Criticism
   of the N.T., p. 190. Jesus seems to say to Martha that only one dish
   was really necessary for the meal instead of the "many" about which she
   was so anxious.

   10:42 The good portion [ten agathen merida]. The best dish on the
   table, fellowship with Jesus. This is the spiritual application of the
   metaphor of the dishes on the table. Salvation is not "the good
   portion" for Martha had that also. From her [autes]. Ablative case
   after [aphairethesetai] (future passive indicative). Jesus pointedly
   takes Mary's side against Martha's fussiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 11

   11:1 As he was praying in a certain place [en tOi einai auton en topOi
   tini proseuchomenon]. Characteristically Lukan idiom: [en] with
   articular periphrastic infinitive [einai proseuchomenon] with
   accusative of general reference [auton]. That. Not in the Greek,
   asyndeton [kai egeneto eipen]. When he ceased [hOs epausato]. Supply
   [proseuchomenos] (praying), complementary or supplementary participle.
   Teach us [didaxon hemas]. Jesus had taught them by precept (Mt 6:7-15)
   and example (Lu 9:29). Somehow the example of Jesus on this occasion
   stirred them to fresh interest in the subject and to revival of
   interest in John's teachings (Lu 5:33). So Jesus gave them the
   substance of the Model Prayer in Matthew, but in shorter form. Some of
   the MSS. have one or all of the phrases in Matthew, but the oldest
   documents have it in the simplest form. See on Mt 6:7-15 for discussion
   of these details (Father, hallowed, kingdom, daily bread, forgiveness,
   bringing us into temptation). In Mt 6:11 "give" is [dos] (second aorist
   active imperative second singular, a single act) while here Lu 11:3
   "give" is [didou] (present active imperative, both from [didOmi] and
   means, "keep on giving." So in Lu 11:4 we have "For we ourselves also
   forgive" [kai gar autoi aphiomen], present active indicative of the
   late [O] verb [aphiO] while Mt 6:12 has "as we also forgave" [hOs kai
   hemeis aphekamen], first aorist [k] aorist) active of [aphiemi]. So
   also where Mt 6:12 has "debts" [ta opheilemata] Lu 11:4 has "sins" [tas
   hamartias]. But the spirit of each prayer is the same. There is no
   evidence that Jesus meant either form to be a ritual. In both Mt 6:13;
   Lu 11:4 [me eisenegkeis] occurs (second aorist subjunctive with [me] in
   prohibition, ingressive aorist). "Bring us not" is a better translation
   than "lead us not." There is no such thing as God enticing one to sin
   (Jas 1:13). Jesus urges us to pray not to be tempted as in Lu 22:40 in
   Gethsemane.

   11:5 At midnight [mesonuktiou]. Genitive of time. And say to him [kai
   eipei autOi]. This is the deliberative subjunctive, but it is preceded
   by two future indicatives that are deliberative also [hexei,
   poreusetai]. Lend me [chreson moi]. First aorist active imperative
   second singular. Lend me now. From [kichremi], an old verb, to lend as
   a matter of friendly interest as opposed to [daneizO], to lend on
   interest as a business. Only here in the N.T.

   11:6 To set before him [ho parathesO autOi]. Which I shall place beside
   him. Future active of [paratithemi]. See 9:16 for this same verb.

   11:7 And he [kakeinos]. Emphatic. Shall say (eipei]. Still the aorist
   active deliberative subjunctive as in verse 5 (the same long and
   somewhat involved sentence). Trouble me not [me moi kopous pareche].
   [Me] and the present imperative active. Literally, "Stop furnishing
   troubles to me." On this use of [kopous parechO] see also Mt 26:10; Mr
   14:6; Ga 6:17 and the singular [kopon], Lu 18:5. The door is now shut
   [ede he thura kekleistai]. Perfect passive indicative, shut to stay
   shut. Oriental locks are not easy to unlock. From [kleiO], common verb.
   In bed [eis ten koiten]. Note use of [eis] in sense of [en]. Often a
   whole family would sleep in the same room. I cannot [ou dunamai]. That
   is, I am not willing.

   11:8 Though [ei kai]. [Kai ei] would be "Even if," a different idea.
   Because he is his friend [dia to einai philon autou]. [Dia] and the
   accusative articular infinitive with accusative of general reference, a
   causal clause = "because of the being a friend of his." Yet because of
   his importunity [dia ge ten anaidian autou]. From [anaides], shameless,
   and that from [a] privative and [aidOs], shame, shamelessness,
   impudence. An old word, but here alone in the N.T. Examples in the
   papyri. The use of [ge] here, one of the intensive particles, is to be
   noted. It sharpens the contrast to "though" by "yet." As examples of
   importunate prayer Vincent notes Abraham in behalf of Sodom (Ge
   18:23-33) and the Syro-Phoenician woman in behalf of her daughter (Mt
   15:22-28).

   11:9 Shall be opened [anoigesetai]. Second future passive third
   singular of [anoignumi] and the later [anoigO].

   11:11 Of which of you that is a father [tina de ex humOn ton patera].
   There is a decided anacoluthon here. The MSS. differ a great deal. The
   text of Westcott and Hort makes [ton patera] (the father) in apposition
   with [tina] (of whom) and in the accusative the object of [aitesei]
   (shall ask) which has also another accusative (both person and thing)
   "a loaf." So far so good. But the rest of the sentence is, will ye give
   him a stone? [me lithon epidOsei autOi;]. [Me] shows that the answer No
   is expected, but the trouble is that the interrogative [tina] in the
   first clause is in the accusative the object of [aitesei] while here
   the same man (he) is the subject of [epidOsei]. It is a very awkward
   piece of Greek and yet it is intelligible. Some of the old MSS. do not
   have the part about "loaf" and "stone," but only the two remaining
   parts about "fish" and "serpent," "egg" and "scorpion." The same
   difficult construction is carried over into these questions also.

   11:13 Know how to give [oidate didonai]. See on Mt 7:11 for this same
   saying. Only here Jesus adds the Holy Spirit [pneuma hagion] as the
   great gift (the summum bonum) that the Father is ready to bestow. Jesus
   is fond of "how much more" [posOi mallon], by how much more,
   instrumental case).

   11:14 When [tou daimoniou exelthontos]. Genitive absolute ana asyndeton
   between [kai egeneto] and [elalesen] as often in Luke (no [hoti] or
   [kai].

   11:15 Dumb [kOphon]. See on Mt 9:32. By Beelzebub [en Beezeboul].
   Blasphemous accusation here in Judea as in Galilee (Mr 3:22; Mt
   12:24,27). See on Matthew for discussion of the form of this name and
   the various items in the sin against the Holy Spirit involved in the
   charge. It was useless to deny the fact of the miracles. So they were
   explained as wrought by Satan himself, a most absurd explanation.

   11:16 Tempting him [peirazontes]. These "others" [heteroi] apparently
   realized the futility of the charge of being in league with Beelzebub.
   Hence they put up to Jesus the demand for "a sign from heaven" just as
   had been done in Galilee (Mt 12:38). By "sign" [semeion] they meant a
   great spectacular display of heavenly power such as they expected the
   Messiah to give and such as the devil suggested to Jesus on the
   pinnacle of the temple. Sought [ezetoun]. Imperfect active, kept on
   seeking.

   11:17 But he [autos de]. In contrast with them. Knowing their thoughts
   [eidOs autOn ta dianoemata]. From [dianoeO], to think through or
   distinguish. This substantive is common in Plato, but occurs nowhere
   else in the N.T. It means intent, purpose. Jesus knew that they were
   trying to tempt him. And a house divided against a house falleth [kai
   oikos epi oikon piptei]. It is not certain that [diameristheisa]
   (divided) is to be repeated here as in Mt 12:25; Mr 3:25. It may mean,
   and house falls upon house, "one tumbling house knocking down its
   neighbour, a graphic picture of what happens when a kingdom is divided
   against itself" (Bruce).

   11:18 Because ye say [hoti legete]. Jesus here repeats in indirect
   discourse (accusative and infinitive) the charge made against him in
   verse 15. The condition is of the first class, determined as fulfilled.

   11:19 And if I by Beelzebub [ei de egO en Beezeboul]. Also a condition
   of the first class, determined as fulfilled. A Greek condition deals
   only with the statement, not with the actual facts. For sake of
   argument, Jesus here assumes that he casts out demons by Beelzebub. The
   conclusion is a reductio ad absurdum.The Jewish exorcists practiced
   incantations against demons (Ac 19:13).

   11:20 By the finger of God [en daktulOi theou]. In distinction from the
   Jewish exorcists. Mt 12:28 has "by the Spirit of God." Then is come
   [ara ephthasen]. [PhthanO] in late Greek comes to mean simply to come,
   not to come before. The aorist indicative tense here is timeless. Note
   [ara] (accordingly) in the conclusion [apodosis].

   11:21 Fully armed [kathOplismenos]. Perfect passive participle of
   [kathoplizO], an old verb, but here only in the N.T. Note perfective
   use of [kata] in composition with [hoplizO], to arm (from [hopla],
   arms). Note indefinite temporal clause [hotan] and present subjunctive
   [phulassei]. His own court [ten heautou aulen]. His own homestead. Mr
   3:27; Mt 12:29 has "house" [oikian]. [Aule] is used in the N.T. in
   various senses (the court in front of the house, the court around which
   the house is built, then the house as a whole). His goods [ta
   huparchonta autou]. "His belongings." Neuter plural present active
   participle of [huparchO] used as substantive with genitive.

   11:22 But when [epan de]. Note [hotan] in verse 21. Stronger than he
   [ischuroteros autou]. Comparative of [ischuros] followed by the
   ablative. Come upon him and overcome him [epelthOn nikesei auton].
   Second aorist active participle of [eperchomai] and first aorist active
   subjunctive of [nikaO]. Aorist tense here because a single onset while
   in verse 22 the guarding [phulassei], present active subjunctive) is
   continuous. His whole armour [ten panoplian autou]. An old and common
   word for all the soldier's outfit (shield, sword, lance, helmet,
   greaves, breastplate). Tyndale renders it "his harness." In the N.T.
   only here and Eph 6:11,13 where the items are given. Wherein he trusted
   [eph' hei epepoithei]. Second past perfect active of [peithO], to
   persuade. The second perfect [pepoitha] is intransitive, to trust. Old
   and common verb. He trusted his weapons which had been so efficacious.
   His spoils [ta skula autou]. It is not clear to what this figure
   refers. Strong as Satan is Jesus is stronger and wins victories over
   him as he was doing then. In Col 2:15 Christ is pictured as triumphing
   openly over the powers of evil by the Cross.

   11:23 He that is not with me [ho me On met' emou]. This verse is just
   like Mt 12:30).

   11:24 And finding none [kai me heuriskon]. Here Mt 12:43 has [kai ouch
   heuriskei] (present active indicative instead of present active
   participle). Lu 11:24-26 is almost verbatim like Mt 12:43-45, which
   see. Instead of just "taketh" [paralambanei] in verse 26, Matthew has
   "taketh with himself" [paralambanei meth' heautou]. And Luke omits:
   "Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation" of Mt 12:45. Than
   the first [tOn prOtOn]. Ablative case after the comparative [cheirona].
   The seven demons brought back remind one of the seven that afflicted
   Mary Magdalene (Lu 8:2).

   11:27 As he said these things [en tOi legein auton]. Luke's common
   idiom, [en] with articular infinitive. Verses 27, 28 are peculiar to
   Luke. His Gospel in a special sense is the Gospel of Woman. This woman
   "speaks well, but womanly" (Bengel). Her beatitude [makaria] reminds us
   of Elisabeth's words (Lu 1:42, [eulogemene]. She is fulfilling Mary's
   own prophecy in 1:48 [makariousin me], shall call me happy).

   11:28 But he said [autos de eipen]. Jesus in contrast turns attention
   to others and gives them a beatitude [makarioi]. "The originality of
   Christ's reply guarantees its historical character. Such a comment is
   beyond the reach of an inventor" (Plummer).

   11:29 Were gathering together unto him [epathroizomenOn]. Genitive
   absolute present middle participle of [epathroizO], a rare verb,
   Plutarch and here only in the N.T., from [epi] and [athroizO] (a common
   enough verb). It means to throng together [athroos], in throngs). Vivid
   picture of the crowds around Jesus. But the sign of Jonah [ei me to
   semeion IOna]. Luke does not give here the burial and resurrection of
   Jesus of which Jonah's experience in the big fish was a type (Mt
   12:39ff.), but that is really implied (Plummer argues) by the use here
   of "shall be given" [dothesetai] and "shall be" [estai], for the
   resurrection of Jesus is still future. The preaching of Jesus ought to
   have been sign enough as in the case of Jonah, but the resurrection
   will be given. Luke's report is much briefer and omits what is in Mt
   12:41.

   11:31 With the men of this generation [meta tOn andrOn tes geneas
   tautes]. Here Mt 12:42 has simply "with this generation," which see.

   11:32 At the preaching of Jonah [eis to kerugma IOna]. Note this use of
   [eis] as in Mt 10:41; 12:41. Luke inserts the words about the Queen of
   the South (31) in between the discussion of Jonah (verses 29f., 32).
   Both [SolomOnos] (31) and [IOna] (verse 32) are in the ablative case
   after the comparative [pleion] (more, something more).

   11:33 In a cellar [eis krupten]. A crypt (same word) or hidden place
   from [kruptO], to hide. Late and rare word and here only in the N.T.
   These other words (lamp, [luchnon], bushel, [modion], stand, [luchnian]
   have all been discussed previously (Mt 5:15). Lu 11:33 is like Mt
   6:22f., which see for details.

   11:35 Whether not [me]. This use of [me] in an indirect question is
   good Greek (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1045). It is a pitiful situation if
   the very light is darkness. This happens when the eye of the soul is
   too diseased to see the light of Christ.

   11:36 With its bright shining [tei astrapei]. Instrumental case, as if
   by a flash of lightning the light is revealed in him. See on 10:18.

   11:37 Now as he spake [en de tOi lalesai]. Luke's common idiom, [en]
   with the articular infinitive (aorist active infinitive) but it does
   not mean "after he had spoken" as Plummer argues, but simply "in the
   speaking," no time in the aorist infinitive. See 3:21 for similar use
   of aorist infinitive with [en]. Asketh [erOtai]. Present active
   indicative, dramatic present. Request, not question. To dine [hopOs
   aristesei]. Note [hopOs] rather than the common [hina]. Aorist active
   subjunctive rather than present, for a single meal. The verb is from
   [ariston] (breakfast). See distinction between [ariston] and [deipnon]
   (dinner or supper) in Lu 14:12. It is the morning meal (breakfast or
   lunch) after the return from morning prayers in the synagogue (Mt
   22:4), not the very early meal called [akratisma]. The verb is,
   however, used for the early meal on the seashore in Joh 21:12,15. With
   him [par' autOi]. By his side. Sat down to meat [anepesen]. Second
   aorist active indicative of [anapiptO], old verb, to recline, to fall
   back on the sofa or lounge. No word here for "to meat."

   11:38 That he had not first washed before dinner [hoti ou prOton
   ebaptisthe pro tou aristou]. The verb is first aorist passive
   indicative of [baptizO], to dip or to immerse. Here it is applied to
   the hands. It was the Jewish custom to dip the hands in water before
   eating and often between courses for ceremonial purification. In
   Galilee the Pharisees and scribes had sharply criticized the disciples
   for eating with unwashed hands (Mr 7:1-23; Mt 15:1-20) when Jesus had
   defended their liberty and had opposed making a necessity of such a
   custom (tradition) in opposition to the command of God. Apparently
   Jesus on this occasion had himself reclined at the breakfast (not
   dinner) without this ceremonial dipping of the hands in water. The
   Greek has "first before" [prOton pro], a tautology not preserved in the
   translation.

   11:39 The Lord [ho kurios]. The Lord Jesus plainly and in the narrative
   portion of Luke. Now [nun]. Probably refers to him. You Pharisees do
   now what was formerly done. The platter [tou pinakos]. The dish. Old
   word, rendered "the charger" in Mt 14:8. Another word for "platter"
   [paropsis] in Mt 23:25 means "side-dish." But your inward part [to de
   esOthen humOn]. The part within you (Pharisees). They keep the external
   regulations, but their hearts are full of plunder [harpages], from
   [harpazO], to seize) and wickedness [ponerias], from [poneros], evil
   man). See Mt 23:25 for a like indictment of the Pharisees for care for
   the outside of the cup but neglect of what is on the inside. Both
   inside and outside should be clean, but the inside first.

   11:40 Howbeit [plen]. See Lu 6:24. Instead of devoting so much
   attention to the outside. Those things which are within [ta enonta].
   Articular neuter plural participle from [eneimi], to be in, common
   verb. This precise phrase only here in the N.T. though in the papyri,
   and it is not clear what it means. Probably, give as alms the things
   within the dishes, that is have inward righteousness with a brotherly
   spirit and the outward becomes "clean" [kathara]. Properly understood,
   this is not irony and is not Ebionism, but good Christianity (Plummer).

   11:42 Tithe [apodekatoute]. Late verb for the more common [dekateuO].
   So in Mt 23:23. Take a tenth off [apo-]. Rue [peganon]. Botanical term
   in late writers from [pegnumi], to make fast because of its thick
   leaves. Here Mt 23:23 has "anise." Every herb [pan lachanon]. General
   term as in Mr 4:32. Matthew has "cummin." Pass by [parerchesthe].
   Present middle indicative of [parerchomai], common verb, to go by or
   beside. Mt 23:23 has "ye have left undone" [aphekate]. Luke here has
   "love" [agapen], not in Matthew. Ought [edei]. As in Matthew. Imperfect
   of a present obligation, not lived up to just like our "ought" [owed],
   not paid). [Pareinai], as in Matthew, the second aorist active
   infinitive of [aphiemi]. to leave off. Common verb. Luke does not have
   the remark about straining out the gnat and swallowing the camel (Mt
   23:34). It is plain that the terrible exposure of the scribes and
   Pharisees in Mt 23 in the temple was simply the culmination of previous
   conflicts such as this one.

   11:43 The chief seats in the synagogues [ten prOtokathedrian en tais
   sunagOgais]. Singular here, plural in Mt 23:6. This semi-circular bench
   faced the congregation. Mt 23:6 has also the chief place at feasts
   given by Luke also in that discourse (20:46) as well as in 14:7, a
   marked characteristic of the Pharisees.

   11:44 The tombs which appear not [ta mneneia ta adela]. These hidden
   graves would give ceremonial defilement for seven days (Nu 19:16).
   Hence they were usually whitewashed as a warning. So in Mt 23:27 the
   Pharisees are called "whited sepulchres." Men do not know how rotten
   they are. The word [adelos] [a] privative and [delos], apparent or
   plain) occurs in the N.T. only here and 1Co 14:8, though an old and
   common word. Here men walking around [peripatountes] walk over the
   tombs without knowing it. These three woes cut to the quick and
   evidently made the Pharisees wince.

   11:45 Thou reproachest us also [kai hemas hubrizeis]. Because the
   lawyers (scribes) were usually Pharisees. The verb [hubrizO] is an old
   one and common for outrageous treatment, a positive insult (so Lu
   18:32; Mt 22:6; Ac 14;5; 1Th 2:2). So Jesus proceeds to give the
   lawyers three woes as he had done to the Pharisees.

   11:46 Grievous to be borne [dusbastakta]. A late word in LXX and
   Plutarch [dus] and [bastazO]. Here alone in text of Westcott and Hort
   who reject it in Mt 23:4 where we have "heavy burdens" [phortia barea].
   In Gal 6:2 we have [bare] with a distinction drawn. Here we have
   [phortizete] (here only in the N.T. and Mt 11:28) for "lade," [phortia]
   as cognate accusative and then [phortiois] (dative after [ou
   prospsauete], touch not). It is a fierce indictment of scribes
   (lawyers) for their pettifogging interpretations of the written law in
   their oral teaching (later written down as Mishna and then as Gemarah),
   a terrible load which these lawyers did not pretend to carry
   themselves, not even "with one of their fingers" to "touch"
   [prospsauO], old verb but only here in the N.T.), touch with the view
   to remove. Mt 23:4 has [kinesai], to move. A physician would understand
   the meaning of [prospauO] for feeling gently a sore spot or the pulse.

   11:48 Consent [suneudokeite]. Double compound [sun, eu, dokeO], to
   think well along with others, to give full approval. A late verb,
   several times in the N.T., in Ac 8:1 of Saul's consenting to and
   agreeing to Stephen's death. It is a somewhat subtle, but just,
   argument made here. Outwardly the lawyers build tombs for the prophets
   whom their fathers (forefathers) killed as if they disapproved what
   their fathers did. But in reality they neglect and oppose what the
   prophets teach just as their fathers did. So they are "witnesses"
   [martures] against themselves (Mt 23:31).

   11:49 The wisdom of God [he sophia tou theou]. In Mt 23:34 Jesus uses
   "I send" [egO apostellO] without this phrase "the wisdom of God." There
   is no book to which it can refer. Jesus is the wisdom of God as Paul
   shows (1Co 1:30), but it is hardly likely that he so describes himself
   here. Probably he means that God in his wisdom said, but even so "Jesus
   here speaks with confident knowledge of the Divine counsels" (Plummer).
   See Lu 10:22; 15:7,10). Here the future tense occurs, "I will send"
   [apostelO]. Some of them [ex autOn]. No "some" [tinas] in the Greek,
   but understood. They will act as their fathers did. They will kill and
   persecute.

   11:50 That . . . may be required [hina . . . ekzetethei]. Divinely
   ordered sequence, first aorist passive subjunctive of [ekzeteO], a late
   and rare verb outside of LXX and N.T., requiring as a debt the blood of
   the prophets. Which was shed [to ekkechumenon]. Perfect passive
   participle of [ekcheO] and [ekchunnO] (an Aeolic form appearing in the
   margin of Westcott and Hort here, [ekchunnomenon], present passive
   participle). If the present passive is accepted, it means the blood
   which is perpetually shed from time to time. From the foundation of the
   world [apo kataboles kosmou]. See also Mt 25:34; Joh 17:24; Eph 1:4,
   etc. It is a bold metaphor for the purpose of God.

   11:51 From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah [apo haimatos
   Abel heOs haimatos Zachariou]. The blood of Abel is the first shed in
   the Old Testament (Ge 4:10), that of Zacharias the last in the O.T.
   canon which ended with Chronicles (2Ch 24:22). Chronologically the
   murder of Uriah by Jehoiakim was later (Jer 26:23), but this climax is
   from Genesis to II Chronicles (the last book in the canon). See on Mt
   23:35 for discussion of Zachariah as "the son of Barachiah" rather than
   "the son of Jehoiada." Between the altar and the sanctuary [metaxu tou
   thusiasteriou kai tou oikou]. Literally, between the altar and the
   house (Mt 23:35 has temple, [naou].

   11:52 Ye took away the key of knowledge [erate ten kleida tes gnOseOs].
   First aorist active indicative of [airO], common verb. But this is a
   flat charge of obscurantism on the part of these scribes (lawyers), the
   teachers (rabbis) of the people. They themselves [autoi] refused to go
   into the house of knowledge (beautiful figure) and learn. They then
   locked the door and hid the key to the house of knowledge and hindered
   [ekOlusate], effective aorist active) those who were trying to enter
   [tous eiserchomenous], present participle, conative action). It is the
   most pitiful picture imaginable of blind ecclesiastics trying to keep
   others as blind as they were, blind leaders of the blind, both falling
   into the pit.

   11:53 From thence [k'akeithen]. Out of the Pharisee's house. What
   became of the breakfast we are not told, but the rage of both Pharisees
   and lawyers knew no bounds. To press upon him [enechein]. An old Greek
   verb to hold in, to be enraged at, to have it in for one. It is the
   same verb used of the relentless hatred of Herodias for John the
   Baptist (Mr 6:19). To provoke him to speak [apostomatizein]. From [apo]
   and [stoma] (mouth). Plato uses it of repeating to a pupil for him to
   recite from memory, then to recite by heart (Plutarch). Here (alone in
   the N.T.) the verb means to ply with questions, to entice to answers,
   to catechize. Of many things [peri pleionOn]. "Concerning more
   (comparative) things." They were stung to the quick by these woes which
   laid bare their hollow hypocrisy.

   11:54 Laying wait for him [enedreuontes auton]. An old verb from [en]
   and [hedra], a seat, so to lie in ambush for one. Here only and Ac
   23:21 in the N.T. Vivid picture of the anger of these rabbis who were
   treating Jesus as if he were a beast of prey. To catch something out of
   his mouth [thereusai to ek tou stomatos autou]. An old Greek verb,
   though here only in the N.T., from [thera] (cf. Ro 11:9), to ensnare,
   to catch in hunting, to hunt. These graphic words from the chase show
   the rage of the rabbis toward Jesus. Luke gives more details here than
   in 20:45-47; Mt 23:1-7, but there is no reason at all why Jesus should
   not have had this conflict at the Pharisee's breakfast before that in
   the temple in the great Tuesday debate.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 12

   12:1 In the meantime [en hois]. It is a classic idiom to start a
   sentence or even a paragraph as here with a relative, "in which things
   or circumstances," without any expressed antecedent other than the
   incidents in 11:53f. In 12:3 Luke actually begins the sentence with two
   relatives [anth' hOn hosa] (wherefore whatsoever). Many thousands
   [muriadOn]. Genitive absolute with [episunachtheisOn] (first aorist
   passive participle feminine plural because of [muriadOn], a double
   compound late verb, [episunagO], to gather together unto. The word
   "myriads" is probably hyperbolical as in Ac 21:20, but in the sense of
   ten thousand, as in Ac 19:19, it means a very large crowd apparently
   drawn together by the violent attacks of the rabbis against Jesus.
   Insomuch that they trode one upon another [hOste katapatein allelous].
   The imagination must complete the picture of this jam. Unto his
   disciples first of all [pros tous mathetas autou prOton]. This long
   discourse in Lu 12 is really a series of separate talks to various
   groups in the vast crowds around Jesus. This particular talk goes
   through verse 12. Beware of [prosechete heautois apo]. Put your mind
   [noun] understood) for yourselves (dative) and avoid [apo] with the
   ablative). The leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy [tes zumes
   hetis estin hupocrisis tOn PharisaiOn]. In Mr 8:15 Jesus had coupled
   the lesson of the Pharisees with that of Herod, in Mt 16:6 with that of
   the Sadducees also. He had long ago called the Pharisees hypocrites (Mt
   6:2,5,16). The occasion was ripe here for this crisp saying. In Mt
   13:33 leaven does not have an evil sense as here, which see. See Mt
   23:13 for hypocrites. Hypocrisy was the leading Pharisaic vice (Bruce)
   and was a mark of sanctity to hide an evil heart.

   12:2 Covered up [sugkekalummenon estin]. Periphrastic perfect passive
   indicative of [sugkaluptO], an old verb, but here only in the N.T., to
   cover up on all sides and so completely. Verses 2-9 here are parallel
   with Mt 10:26-33 spoken to the Twelve on their tour of Galilee,
   illustrating again how often Jesus repeated his sayings unless we
   prefer to say that he never did so and that the Gospels have hopelessly
   jumbled them as to time and place. See the passage in Matthew for
   discussion of details.

   12:3 In the inner chambers [en tois tameiois]. Old form [tamieion], a
   store chamber (Lu 12:24), secret room (Mt 6:6; Lu 12:3).

   12:4 Unto you my friends [humin tois philois]. As opposed to the
   Pharisees and lawyers in 11:43, 46, 53. Be not afraid of [me phobethete
   apo]. First aorist passive subjunctive with [me], ingressive aorist, do
   not become afraid of, with [apo] and the ablative like the Hebrew min
   and the English "be afraid of," a translation Hebraism as in Mt 10:28
   (Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 102). Have no more that they can do [me
   echontOn perissoteron ti poiesai]. Luke often uses the infinitive thus
   with [echO], a classic idiom (7:40, 42; 12:4,50; 14:14; Ac 4:14, etc.).

   12:5 Whom ye shall fear [tina phobethete]. First aorist passive
   subjunctive deliberative retained in the indirect question. [Tina] is
   the accusative, the direct object of this transitive passive verb (note
   [apo] in verse 4). Fear him who [phobethete ton]. First aorist passive
   imperative, differing from the preceding form only in the accent and
   governing the accusative also. After he hath killed [meta to
   apokteinai]. Preposition [meta] with the articular infinitive.
   Literally, "After the killing" (first aorist active infinitive of the
   common verb [apokteinO], to kill. Into hell[eis ten geennan]. See on Mt
   5:22. Gehenna is a transliteration of Ge-Hinnom, Valley of Hinnon where
   the children were thrown on to the red-hot arms of Molech. Josiah (2Ki
   23:10) abolished these abominations and then it was a place for all
   kinds of refuse which burned ceaselessly and became a symbol of
   punishment in the other world. This one fear [touton phobethete]. As
   above.

   12:6 Is forgotten [estin epilelesmenon]. Periphrastic perfect passive
   indicative of [epilanthanomai], common verb to forget. See Mt 10:29 for
   a different construction.

   12:7 Numbered [erithmentai]. Perfect passive indicative. Periphrastic
   form in Mt 10:30 which see for details about sparrows, etc.

   12:8 Everyone who shall confess me [pas hos an homologesei en emoi].
   Just like Mt 10:32 except the use of [an] here which adds nothing. The
   Hebraistic use of [en] after [homologeO] both here and in Matthew is
   admitted by even Moulton (Prolegomena, p. 104). The Son of man [ho
   huios tou anthrOpou]. Here Mt 10:32 has [k'agO] (I also) as the
   equivalent.

   12:9 Shall be denied [aparnethesetai]. First future passive of the
   compound verb [aparneomai]. Here Mt 10:33 has [arnesomai] simply.
   Instead of "in the presence of the angels of God" [emprosthen tOn
   aggelOn tou theou] Mt 10:33 has "before my Father who is in heaven."

   12:10 But unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit [tOi de eis
   to hagion pneuma blasphemesanti]. This unpardonable sin is given by Mr
   3:28f.; Mt 12:31f. immediately after the charge that Jesus was in
   league with Beelzebub. Luke here separates it from the same charge made
   in Judea (11:15-20). As frequently said, there is no sound reason for
   saying that Jesus only spoke his memorable sayings once. Luke
   apparently finds a different environment here. Note the use of [eis]
   here in the sense of "against."

   12:11 Be not anxious [me merimnesete]. First aorist active subjunctive
   with [me] in prohibition. Do not become anxious. See a similar command
   to the Twelve on their Galilean tour (Mt 10:19f.) and in the great
   discourse on the Mount of Olives at the end (Mr 13:11; Lu 21:14f.),
   given twice by Luke as we see. How or what ye shall answer [pOs e ti
   apologesesthe]. Indirect question and retaining the deliberative
   subjunctive [apologesesthe] and also [eipete] (say).

   12:12 What ye ought to say [ha dei eipein]. Literally, what things it
   is necessary [dei] to say. This is no excuse for neglect in pulpit
   preparation. It is simply a word for courage in a crisis to play the
   man for Christ and to trust the issue with God without fear.

   12:13 Bid my brother [eipe tOi adelphOi mou]. This volunteer from the
   crowd draws attention to the multitude (verses 13-21). He does not ask
   for arbitration and there is no evidence that his brother was willing
   for that. He wants a decision by Jesus against his brother. The law (De
   21:17) was two-thirds to the elder, one-third to the younger.

   12:14 A judge or a divider [kriten e meristen]. Jesus repudiates the
   position of judge or arbiter in this family fuss. The language reminds
   one of Ex 2:14. Jesus is rendering unto Caesar the things of Caesar (Lu
   20:25) and shows that his kingdom is not of this world (Joh 18:36). The
   word for divider or arbiter [meristes] is a late word from [merizomai]
   (verse 13) and occurs here only in the N.T.

   12:15 From all covetousness [apo pases pleonexias]. Ablative case. From
   every kind of greedy desire for more [pleon], more, [hexia], from
   [echO], to have) an old word which we have robbed of its sinful aspects
   and refined to mean business thrift. In the abundance of the things
   which he possesseth [en tOi perisseuein tini ek tOn huparchontOn
   autOi]. A rather awkward Lukan idiom: "In the abounding (articular
   infinitive) to one out of the things belonging (articular participle)
   to him."

   12:16 A parable unto them [parabolen pros autous]. The multitude of
   verses 13, 15. A short and pungent parable suggested by the
   covetousness of the man of verse 13. Brought forth plentifully
   [euphoresen]. Late word from [euphoros] (bearing well), in medical
   writers and Josephus, here only in the N.T.

   12:17 Reasoned within himself [dielogizeto en hautOi]. Imperfect
   middle, picturing his continued cogitations over his perplexity. Where
   to bestow [pou sunaxO]. Future indicative deliberative, where I shall
   gather together. My fruits [tous karpous mou]. So it is with the rich
   fool: my fruits, my barns, my corn, my goods, just like Nabal whose
   very name means fool (1Sa 25:11), whether a direct reference to him or
   not.

   12:18 I will pull down [kathelO]. Future active of [kathaireO], an old
   verb, the usual future being [kathairesO]. This second form from the
   second aorist [katheilon] (from obsolete [helO] like [aphelei] in Re
   22:19. My barns [mou tas apothekas]. From [apotithemi], to lay by, to
   treasure. So a granary or storehouse, an old word, six times in the
   N.T. (Mt 3:12; 6:26; 13:30; Lu 3:17; 12:18,24). All my corn [panta ton
   siton]. Better grain (wheat, barley), not maize or Indian corn. My
   goods [ta agatha mou]. Like the English, my good things. So the English
   speak of goods (freight) train.

   12:19 Laid up for many years [keimena eis ete polla]. Not in D and some
   other Latin MSS. The man's apostrophe to his "soul" [psuche] is
   thoroughly Epicurean, for his soul feeds on his goods. The asyndeton
   here (take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry) shows his eagerness. Note
   difference in tenses [anapauou], keep on resting, [phage], eat at once,
   [pie], drink thy fill, [euphrainou], keep on being merry), first and
   last presents, the other two aorists.

   12:20 Thou foolish one [aphrOn]. Fool, for lack of sense [a] privative
   and [phren], sense) as in 11:40; 2Co 11:19. Old word, used by Socrates
   in Xenophon. Nominative form as vocative. Is thy soul required of thee
   [ten psuchen sou aitousin apo sou]. Plural active present, not passive:
   "They are demanding thy soul from thee." The impersonal plural
   (aitousin) is common enough (Lu 6:38; 12:11; 16:9; 23:31). The rabbis
   used "they" to avoid saying "God."

   12:21 Not rich toward God [me eis theon ploutOn]. The only wealth that
   matters and that lasts. Cf. 16:9; Mt 6:19f. Some MSS. do not have this
   verse. Westcott and Hort bracket it.

   12:22 Unto his disciples [pros tous mathetas autou]. So Jesus turns
   from the crowd to the disciples (verses 22-40, when Peter interrupts
   the discourse). From here to the end of the chapter Luke gives material
   that appears in Matthew, but not in one connection as here. In Matthew
   part of it is in the charge to the Twelve on their tour in Galilee,
   part in the eschatological discourse on the Mount of Olives. None of it
   is in Mark. Hence Q or the Logia seems to be the source of it. The
   question recurs again whether Jesus repeated on other occasions what is
   given here or whether Luke has here put together separate discourses as
   Matthew is held by many to have done in the Sermon on the Mount. We
   have no way of deciding these points. We can only say again that Jesus
   would naturally repeat his favourite sayings like other popular
   preachers and teachers. So Lu 12:22-31 corresponds to Mt 6:25-33, which
   see for detailed discussion. The parable of the rich fool was spoken to
   the crowd, but this exhortation to freedom from care (22-31) is to the
   disciples. So the language in Lu 12:22 is precisely that in Mt 6:25.
   See there for [me merimnate] (stop being anxious) and the deliberative
   subjunctive retained in the indirect question [phagete, endusesthe]. So
   verse 23 here is the same in Mt 6:25 except that there it is a question
   with [ouch] expecting the affirmative answer, whereas here it is given
   as a reason [gar], for) for the preceding command.

   12:24 The ravens [tous korakas]. Nowhere else in the N.T. The name
   includes the whole crow group of birds (rooks and jackdaws). Like the
   vultures they are scavengers. Mt 6:26 has simply "the birds" [ta
   peteina]. Storechamber (tameion). Not in Mt 6:26. Means secret chamber
   in Lu 12:3. Of how much more [posOi mallon]. Mt 6:26 has question,
   [ouch mallon].

   12:25 A cubit [pechun]. Mt 6:27 has [pechun hena] (one cubit, though
   [hena] is sometimes merely the indefinite article. Stature[helikian] as
   in Matthew, which see.

   12:26 Not able to do even that which is least [oude elachiston
   dunasthe]. Negative [oude] in the condition of the first class. Elative
   superlative, very small. This verse not in Matthew and omitted in D.
   Verse 27 as in Mt 6:28, save that the verbs for toil and spin are
   plural in Matthew and singular here (neuter plural subject, [ta krina].

   12:28 Clothe [amphiazei]. Late Greek verb in the Koine (papyri) for the
   older form [amphiennumi] (Mt 6:30). See Matthew for discussion of
   details. Matthew has "the grass of the field" instead of "the grass in
   the field" as here.

   12:29 Seek not ye [humeis me zeteite]. Note emphatic position of "ye"
   [humeis]. Stop seeking [me] and present imperative active). Mt 6:31
   has: "Do not become anxious" [me merimnesete], [me] and ingressive
   subjunctive occur as direct questions (What are we to eat? What are we
   to drink? What are we to put on?) whereas here they are in the indirect
   form as in verse 22 save that the problem of clothing is not here
   mentioned: Neither be ye of doubtful mind [kai me meteOrizesthe]. [Me]
   and present passive imperative (stop being anxious) of [meteOrizO]. An
   old verb from [meteOros] in midair, high (our meteor), to lift up on
   high, then to lift oneself up with hopes (false sometimes), to be
   buoyed up, to be tossed like a ship at sea, to be anxious, to be in
   doubt as in late writers (Polybius, Josephus). This last meaning is
   probably true here. In the LXX and Philo, but here only in the N.T.

   12:31 See Mt 6:33 for this verse. Luke does not have "first" nor "his
   righteousness" nor "all."

   12:32 Little flock [to mikron poimnion]. Vocative with the article as
   used in Hebrew and often in the Koine and so in the N.T. See both
   [pater] and [ho pater] in the vocative in Lu 10:21. See Robertson,
   Grammar, pp. 465f. [Poimnion] (flock) is a contraction from [poimenion]
   from [poimen] (shepherd) instead of the usual [poimne] (flock). So it
   is not a diminutive and [mikron] is not superfluous, though it is
   pathetic. For it is your Father's good pleasure [hoti eudokesen ho
   pater humOn]. First aorist active indicative of [eudokeO]. Timeless
   aorist as in Lu 3:22. This verse has no parallel in Matthew.

   12:33 Sell that ye have [POlesate ta huparchonta humOn]. Not in
   Matthew. Did Jesus mean this literally and always? Luke has been
   charged with Ebionism, but Jesus does not condemn property as
   inherently sinful. "The attempt to keep the letter of the rule here
   given (Ac 2:44, 45) had disastrous effects on the church of Jerusalem,
   which speedily became a church of paupers, constantly in need of alms
   (Ro 15:25,26; 1Co 16:3; 2Co 8:4; 9:1)" (Plummer). Purses which wax not
   old [ballantia me palaioumena]. So already [ballantion] in Lu 10:4.
   Late verb [palaioO] from [palaios], old, to make old, declare old as in
   Heb 8:13, is passive to become old as here and Heb 1:11. That faileth
   not [anekleipton]. Verbal from [a] privative and [ekleipO], to fail.
   Late word in Diodorus and Plutarch. Only here in the N.T. or LXX, but
   in papyri. "I prefer to believe that even Luke sees in the words not a
   mechanical rule, but a law for the spirit" (Bruce). Draweth near
   [eggizei]. Instead of Mt 6:19 "dig through and steal." Destroyeth
   [diaphtheirei]. Instead of "doth consume" in Mt 6:19.

   12:34 Will be [estai]. Last word in the sentence in Luke. Otherwise
   like Mt 6:21. See 1Co 7:32-34 for similar principle.

   12:35 Be girded about [estOsan periezOsmenai]. Periphrastic perfect
   passive imperative third plural of the verb [perizOnnumi] or
   [perizOnnuO] (later form), an old verb, to gird around, to fasten the
   garments with a girdle. The long garments of the orientals made speed
   difficult. It was important to use the girdle before starting. Cf.
   17:8; Ac 12:8. Burning [kaiomenoi]. Periphrastic present middle
   imperative, already burning and continuously burning. The same point of
   the Parable of the Ten Virgins (Mt 25:1-13) is found here in condensed
   form. This verse introduces the parable of the waiting servants (Lu
   12:35-40).

   12:36 When he shall return from the marriage feast [pote analusei ek
   tOn gamOn]. The interrogative conjunction [pote] and the deliberative
   aorist subjunctive retained in the indirect question. The verb
   [analuO], very common Greek verb, but only twice in the N.T. (here and
   Php 1:23). The figure is breaking up a camp or loosening the mooring of
   a ship, to depart. Perhaps here the figure is from the standpoint of
   the wedding feast (plural as used of a single wedding feast in Lu
   14:8), departing from there. See on Mt 22:2. When he cometh and
   knocketh [elthontos kai krousantos]. Genitive absolute of the aorist
   active participle without [autou] and in spite of [autoi] (dative)
   being used after [anoixOsin] (first aorist active subjunctive of
   [anoigO].

   12:37 He shall gird himself [perizOsetai]. Direct future middle. Jesus
   did this (Joh 13:4), not out of gratitude, but to give the apostles an
   object lesson in humility. See the usual course in Lu 17:7-10 with also
   the direct middle (verse 8) of [perisOnnuO].

   12:38 And if [k'an = kai + ean]. Repeated. [Elthei] and [heurei], both
   second aorist subjunctive with [ean], condition of the third class,
   undetermined, but with prospect of being determined. Blessed
   [makarioi]. Beatitude here as in verse 37.

   12:39 The thief [ho kleptes]. The change here almost makes a new
   parable to illustrate the other, the parable of the housebreaking
   (verses 39, 40) to illustrate the parable of the waiting servants
   (35-38). This same language appears in Mt 24:43f. "The Master returning
   from a wedding is replaced by a thief whose study it is to come to the
   house he means to plunder at an unexpected time" (Bruce). The parallel
   in Mt 24:43-51 with Lu 12:39-46 does not have the interruption by
   Peter. He would have watched [egregoresen an]. Apodosis of second-class
   condition, determined as unfulfilled, made plain by use of [an] with
   aorist indicative which is not repeated with [ouk apheken] (first
   aorist active indicative of [aphiemi], [k] aorist), though it is
   sometimes repeated (Mt 24:43).

   12:40 Be ye [ginesthe]. Present middle imperative, keep on becoming.
   Cometh [erchetai]. Futuristic present indicative. See Mt 24:43-51 for
   details in the comparison with Luke.

   12:41 Peter said [Eipen de ho Petros]. This whole paragraph from verse
   22-40 had been addressed directly to the disciples. Hence it is not
   surprising to find Peter putting in a question. This incident confirms
   also the impression that Luke is giving actual historical data in the
   environment of these discourses. He is certain that the Twelve are
   meant, but he desires to know if others are included, for he had spoken
   to the multitude in verses 13-21. Recall Mr 13:37. This interruption is
   somewhat like that on the Mount of Transfiguration (Lu 9:33) and is
   characteristic of Peter. Was it the magnificent promise in verse 37
   that stirred Peter's impulsiveness? It is certainly more than a
   literary device of Luke. Peter's question draws out a parabolic reply
   by Jesus (42-48).

   12:42 Who then [tis ara]. Jesus introduces this parable of the wise
   steward (42-48) by a rhetorical question that answers itself. Peter is
   this wise steward, each of the Twelve is, anyone is who acts thus. The
   faithful and wise steward [ho pistos oikonomos ho phronimos]. The
   faithful steward, the wise one. A steward is house manager [oikos,
   nemO], to manage). Each man is a steward in his own responsibilities.
   Household [therapeias]. Literally, service from [therapeuO]. medical
   service as in Lu 9:11, by metonymy household (a body of those domestics
   who serve). Their portion of food [to sitometrion]. Late word from
   [sitometreO] (Ge 47:12) for the Attic [ton siton metreO], to measure
   the food, the rations. Here only in the N.T. or anywhere else till
   Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 158) found it in an Egyptian papyrus and
   then an inscription in Lycia (Light from the Ancient East, p. 104).

   12:44 Over all [epi pasin]. See Mt 24-47 for [epi] with locative in
   this sense. Usually with genitive as in verse 42 and sometimes with
   accusative as in verse 14.

   12:45 Shall say [eipei]. Second aorist subjunctive, with [ean],
   condition of the third class, undetermined, but with prospect of being
   determined. Delayeth [chronizei]. From [chronos], time, spends time,
   lingers. Shall begin [arxetai]. First aorist middle subjunctive with
   [ean] and the same condition as [eipei], above. The menservants [tous
   paidas] and the maidservants [kai tas paidiskas]. [Paidiske] is a
   diminutive of [pais] for a young female slave and occurs in the papyri,
   orginally just a damsel. Here [pais] can mean slave also though
   strictly just a boy.

   12:46 Shall cut him asunder [dichotomesei]. An old and somewhat rare
   word from [dichotomos] and that from [dicha] and [temnO], to cut, to
   cut in two. Used literally here. In the N.T. only here and Mt 24:51.
   With the unfaithful [meta tOn apistOn]. Not here "the unbelieving"
   though that is a common meaning of [apistos] [a] privative and
   [pistos], from [peithO], but the unreliable, the untrustworthy. Here Mt
   24:51 has "with the hypocrites," the same point. The parallel with Mt
   24:43-51 ends here. Mt 24:51 adds the saying about the wailing and the
   gnashing of teeth. Clearly there Luke places the parable of the wise
   steward in this context while Matthew has it in the great
   eschatological discourse. Once again we must either think that Jesus
   repeated the parable or that one of the writers has misplaced it. Luke
   alone preserves what he gives in verses 47, 48.

   12:47 Which knew [ho gnous]. Articular participle (second aorist
   active, punctiliar and timeless). The one who knows. So as to [me
   hetoimasas e poiesas] (does not make ready or do). Shall be beaten with
   many stripes [daresetai pollas]. Second future passive of [derO], to
   skin, to beat, to flay (see on Mt 21:35; Mr 12:3,5). The passive voice
   retains here the accusative [pollas] (supply [plegas], present in Lu
   10:30). The same explanation applies to [oligas] in verse 48.

   12:48 To whomsoever much is given [panti de hOi edothe polu]. Here is
   inverse attraction from [hoi] to [panti] (Robertson, Grammar, pp.
   767f.). Note [par' autou] (from him) without any regard to [panti].
   They commit [parethento]. Second aorist middle indicative, timeless or
   gnomic aorist. Note the impersonal plural after the passive voice just
   before.

   12:49 I came to cast fire [Pur elthon balein]. Suddenly Jesus lets the
   volcano in his own heart burst forth. The fire was already burning.
   "Christ came to set the world on fire, and the conflagration had
   already begun" (Plummer). The very passion in Christ's heart would set
   his friends on fire and his foes in opposition as we have just seen (Lu
   11:53f.). It is like the saying of Jesus that he came to bring not
   peace, but a sword, to bring cleavage among men (Mt 10:34-36). And what
   will I, if it is already kindled? [kai ti thelO ei ede anephthe;]. It
   is not clear what this passage means. Probably [ti] is be taken in the
   sense of "how" [pOs]. How I wish. Then [ei] can be taken as equal to
   [hoti]. How I wish that it were already kindled. [Anephthe] is first
   aorist passive of [anaptO], to set fire to, to kindle, to make blaze.
   Probably Luke means the conflagration to come by his death on the Cross
   for he changes the figure and refers to that more plainly.

   12:50 I have a baptism [baptisma de echO]. Once again Jesus will call
   his baptism the baptism of blood and will challenge James and John to
   it (Mr 10:32f.; Mt 20:22f.). So here. "Having used the metaphor of
   fire, Christ now uses the metaphor of water. The one sets forth the
   result of his coming as it affects the world, the other as it affects
   himself. The world is lit up with flames and Christ is bathed in blood"
   (Plummer). And how I am straitened [kai pOs sunechomai]. See this same
   vivid verb [sunechomai] in Lu 8:37; Ac 18:5; Php 1:23 where Paul uses
   it of his desire for death just as Jesus does here. The urge of the
   Cross is upon Jesus at the moment of these words. We catch a glimpse of
   the tremendous passion in his soul that drove him on. Till it be
   accomplished [heOs hotou telesthei]. First aorist passive subjunctive
   of [teleO] with [heOs hotou] (until which time), the common
   construction for the future with this conjunction.

   12:51 But rather division [all' e diamerismon]. Peace at any price is
   not the purpose of Christ. It is a pity for family jars to come, but
   loyalty to Christ counts more than all else. These ringing words (Lu
   12:51-53) occur in Mt 10:34-36 in the address to the Twelve for the
   Galilean tour. See discussion of details there. These family feuds are
   inevitable where only part cleave to Christ. In Matthew we have [kata]
   with the genitive whereas in Luke it is [epi] with the dative (and
   accusative once).

   12:54 To the multitudes also [kai tois ochlois]. After the strong and
   stirring words just before with flash and force Jesus turns finally in
   this series of discourses to the multitudes again as in verse 15. There
   are similar sayings to these verses 54-59 in Mt 16:1f; 5:25f. There is
   a good deal of difference in phraseology whether that is due to
   difference of source or different use of the same source (Q or Logia)
   we do not know. Not all the old MSS. give Mt 16:2,3. In Matthew the
   Pharisees and Sadducees were asking for a sign from heaven as they
   often did. These signs of the weather, "a shower" [ombros], Lu 12:54)
   due to clouds in the west, "a hot wave" [kausOn], verse 55) due to a
   south wind [noton] blowing, "fair weather" [eudia], Mt 16:2) when the
   sky is red, are appealed to today. They have a more or less general
   application due to atmospheric and climatic conditions.

   12:56 To interpret this time [ton kairon touton dokimazein]. To test
   [dokimazein] as spiritual chemists. No wonder that Jesus here calls
   them "hypocrites" because of their blindness when looking at and
   hearing him. So it is today with those who are willfully blind to the
   steps of God among men. This ignorance of the signs of the times is
   colossal.

   12:57 Even of yourselves [kai aph' heautOn]. Without the presence and
   teaching of Jesus they had light enough to tell what is right [to
   dikaion] and so without excuse as Paul argued in Ro 1-3.

   12:58 Give diligence to be quit of him [dos ergasian apellachthai ap'
   autou]. Second aorist active imperative [dos] from [didOmi].
   [Apellachthai], perfect passive infinitive of [apallassO] an old verb
   common, but only twice in the N.T. (here and Ac 19:12). Used here in a
   legal sense and the tense emphasizes a state of completion, to be rid
   of him for good. Hale thee [katasurei]. Drag down forcibly, old verb,
   only here in the N.T. To the officer [tOi praktori]. The doer, the
   proctor, the exactor of fines, the executor of punishment. Old word,
   only here in the N.T.

   12:59 Till thou have paid [heOs apodOis]. Second aorist active
   subjunctive of [apodidOmi], to pay back in full. The last mite [to
   eschaton lepton]. From [lepO], to peel off the bark. Very small brass
   coin, one-eighth of an ounce. In the N.T. only here and Lu 21:2; Mr
   12:42 (the poor widow's mite) which see.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 13

   13:1 At that very season [en autOi tOi kairOi]. Luke's frequent idiom,
   "at the season itself." Apparently in close connexion with the
   preceding discourses. Probably "were present" [paresan], imperfect of
   [pareimi] means "came," "stepped to his side," as often (Mt 26:50; Ac
   12:20; Joh 11:28). These people had a piece of news for Jesus. Whose
   blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices [hOn to haima Peilatos
   emixen meta tOn thusiOn autOn]. The verb [emixen] is first aorist
   active (not past perfect) of [mignumi], a common verb. The incident is
   recorded nowhere else, but is in entire harmony with Pilate's record
   for outrages. These Galileans at a feast in Jerusalem may have been
   involved in some insurrection against the Roman government, the leaders
   of whom Pilate had slain right in the temple courts where the
   sacrifices were going on. Jesus comments on the incident, but not as
   the reporters had expected. Instead of denunciation of Pilate he turned
   it into a parable for their own conduct in the uncertainty of life.

   13:2 Sinners above all [hamartOloi para pantas]. [Para] means "beside,"
   placed beside all the Galileans, and so beyond or above (with the
   accusative). Have suffered [peponthasin]. Second perfect active
   indicative third plural from [paschO], common verb, to experience,
   suffer. The tense notes that it is "an irrevocable fact" (Bruce).

   13:3 Except ye repent [ean me metanoete]. Present active subjunctive of
   [metanoeO], to change mind and conduct, linear action, keep on
   changing. Condition of third class, undetermined, but with prospect of
   determination. Ye shall perish [apoleisthe]. Future middle indicative
   of [apollumi] and intransitive. Common verb.

   13:4 The tower in Siloam [ho purgos en SilOam]. Few sites have been
   more clearly located than this. Jesus mentions this accident (only in
   Luke) of his own accord to illustrate still further the responsibility
   of his hearers. Jesus makes use of public events in both these
   incidents to teach spiritual lessons. He gives the "moral" to the
   massacre of the Galilean pilgrims and the "moral" of the catastrophe at
   Siloam. Offenders [opheiletai]. Literally, debtors, not sinners as in
   verse 2 and as the Authorized Version renders here. See 7:41; 11:4; Mt
   6:12; 18:24-34.

   13:5 Except ye repent [ean me metanoesete]. First aorist active
   subjunctive, immediate repentance in contrast to continued repentance,
   [metanoete] in verse 3, though Westcott and Hort put [metanoete] in the
   margin here. The interpretation of accidents is a difficult matter, but
   the moral pointed out by Jesus is obvious.

   13:6 Planted [pephuteumenen]. Perfect passive participle of [phuteuO],
   to plant, an old verb, from [phuton], a plant, and that from [phuO], to
   grow. But this participle with [eichen] (imperfect active of [echO]
   does not make a periphrastic past perfect like our English "had
   planted." It means rather, he had a fig tree, one already planted in
   his vineyard.

   13:7 The vinedresser [ton ampelourgon]. Old word, but here only in the
   N.T., from [ampelos], vine, and [ergon], work. These three years I come
   [tria ete aph' hou erchomai]. Literally, "three years since (from which
   time) I come." These three years, of course, have nothing to do with
   the three years of Christ's public ministry. The three years are
   counted from the time when the fig tree would normally be expected to
   bear, not from the time of planting. The Jewish nation is meant by this
   parable of the barren fig tree. In the withering of the barren fig tree
   later at Jerusalem we see parable changed to object lesson or fact (Mr
   11:12-14; Mt 21:18f.). Cut it down [ekkopson]. "Cut it out," the Greek
   has it, out of the vineyard, perfective use of [ek] with the effective
   aorist active imperative of [koptO], where we prefer "down." Why? [hina
   ti]. Ellipsis here of [genetai] of which [ti] is subject (Robertson,
   Grammar, pp. 739,916). Also [kai]. Besides bearing no fruit. Doth
   cumber the ground [ten gen katargei]. Makes the ground completely idle,
   of no use [kata, argeO], from [argos], [a] privative and [ergon],
   work). Late verb, here only in the N.T. except in Paul's Epistles.

   13:8 Till I shall dig [heOs hotou skapsO]. First aorist active
   subjunctive like [balO] (second aorist active subjunctive of [ballO],
   both common verbs. Dung it [balO kopria]. Cast dung around it, manure
   it. [Kopria], late word, here alone in the N.T.

   13:9 And if it bear fruit thenceforth [k'an men poiesei karpon eis to
   mellon]. Aposiopesis, sudden breaking off for effect (Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 1203). See it also in Mr 11:32; Ac 23:9. Trench (Parables)
   tells a story like this of intercession for the fig tree for one year
   more which is widely current among the Arabs today who say that it will
   certainly bear fruit this time.

   13:10 He was teaching [en didaskOn]. Periphrastic imperfect active.

   13:11 A spirit of infirmity [pneuma astheneias]. A spirit that caused
   the weakness [astheneias], lack of strength) like a spirit of bondage
   (Ro 8:15), genitive case. She was bowed together [en sunkuptousa].
   Periphrastic imperfect active of [sunkuptO], old verb, here only in the
   N.T., to bend together, medical word for curvature of the spine. And
   could in no wise lift herself up [kai me dunamene anakupsai eis to
   panteles]. Negative form of the previous statement. [Anakupsai], first
   aorist active infinitive of [anakuptO] [ana, kuptO], same verb above
   compounded with [sun]. Unable to bend herself up or back at all [eis to
   panteles], wholly as in Heb 7:25 only other passage in the N.T. where
   it occurs). The poor old woman had to come in all bent over.

   13:12 He called her [prosephOnesen]. To come to him (pros]. Thou art
   loosed [apolelusai]. Perfect passive indicative of [apoluO], common
   verb, loosed to stay free. Only N.T. example of use about disease.

   13:13 He laid his hands upon her [epetheken autei tas cheiras]. First
   aorist active indicative of [epitithemi]. As the Great Physician with
   gentle kindness. She was made straight [anOrthOthe]. First aorist
   (effective) passive indicative of [anorthoO], old verb, but only three
   times in the N.T. (Lu 13:13; Heb 12:12; Ac 15:16), to make straight
   again. Here it has the literal sense of making straight the old woman's
   crooked back. She glorified God [edoxazen ton theon]. Imperfect active.
   Began it (inchoative) and kept it up.

   13:14 Answered [apokritheis]. First aorist passive participle of
   [apokrinomai]. No one had spoken to him, but he felt his importance as
   the ruler of the synagogue and was indignant [aganaktOn], from [agan]
   and [achomai], to feel much pain). His words have a ludicrous sound as
   if all the people had to do to get their crooked backs straightened out
   was to come round to his synagogue during the week. He forgot that this
   poor old woman had been coming for eighteen years with no result. He
   was angry with Jesus, but he spoke to the multitude [tOi ochlOi]. Ought
   [dei]. Really, must, necessary, a direct hit at Jesus who had "worked"
   on the sabbath in healing this old woman. And not [kai me]. Instead of
   [kai ou], because in the imperative clause.

   13:15 The Lord answered him [apekrithe de autOi ho Kurios]. Note use of
   "the Lord" of Jesus again in Luke's narrative. Jesus answered the ruler
   of the synagogue who had spoken to the crowd, but about Jesus. It was a
   crushing and overwhelming reply. Hypocrites [hupokritai]. This
   pretentious faultfinder and all who agree with him. Each of you
   [hekastos humOn]. An argumentum ad hominen.These very critics of Jesus
   cared too much for an ox or an ass to leave it all the sabbath without
   water. Stall [phatnes]. Old word, in the N.T. only here and Lu
   2:7,12,16 the manger where the infant Jesus was placed. To watering
   [potizei]. Old verb, causative, to give to drink.

   13:16 Daughter of Abraham [thugatera Abraam]. Triple argument, human
   being and not an ox or ass, woman, daughter of Abraham (Jewess),
   besides being old and ill. Ought not (ouk edei]. Imperfect active. Of
   necessity. Jesus simply had to heal her even if on the sabbath. Whom
   Satan bound [hen edesen ho Satanas]. Definite statement that her
   disease was due to Satan.

   13:17 Were put to shame [kateischunonto]. Imperfect passive of
   [kataischunO], old verb, to make ashamed, make one feel ashamed.
   Passive here, to blush with shame at their predicament. Rejoiced
   [echairen]. Imperfect active. Sharp contrast in the emotions of the two
   groups. Were done [ginomenois]. Present middle participle, were
   continually being done.

   13:18 He said therefore [elegen oun]. It is not clear to what to refer
   "therefore," whether to the case of the woman in verse 11, the
   enthusiasm of the crowd in verse 17, or to something not recorded by
   Luke.

   13:19 A grain of mustard seed [kokkOi sinapeOs]. Either the sinapis
   nigra or the salvadora persica, both of which have small seeds and grow
   to twelve feet at times. The Jews had a proverb: "Small as a mustard
   seed." Given by Mr 4:30-32; Mt 13:31f. in the first great group of
   parables, but just the sort to be repeated. Cast into his own garden
   [ebalen eis kepon heautou]. Different from "earth" (Mark) or "field"
   (Matthew.)" [Kepos], old word for garden, only here in the N.T. and Joh
   19:1,26; 19:41. Became a tree [egeneto eis dendron]. Common Hebraism,
   very frequent in LXX, only in Luke in the N.T., but does appear in
   Koine though rare in papyri; this use of [eis] after words like
   ginomai.It is a translation Hebraism in Luke. Lodged [kateskenOsen].
   Mark and Matthew have [kataskenoin] infinitive of the same verb, to
   make tent (or nest).

   13:20 Whereunto shall I liken? [Tini homoiOsO;]. This question alone in
   Luke here as in verse 18. But the parable is precisely like that in Mt
   13:33, which see for details.

   13:22 Journeying on unto Jerusalem [poreian poioumenos eis Ierosoluma].
   Making his way to Jerusalem. Note tenses here of continued action, and
   distributive use of [kata] with cities and villages. This is the second
   of the journeys to Jerusalem in this later ministry corresponding to
   that in Joh 11.

   13:23 Are they few that be saved? [ei oligoi hoi sOzomenoi;]. Note use
   of [ei] as an interrogative which can be explained as ellipsis or as
   [ei=e] (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1024). This was an academic theological
   problem with the rabbis, the number of the elect.

   13:24 Strive [agOnizesthe]. Jesus makes short shrift of the question.
   He includes others (present middle plural of [agOnizomai], common verb,
   our agonize). Originally it was to contend for a prize in the games.
   The kindred word [agOnia] occurs of Christ's struggle in Gethsemane (Lu
   22:44). The narrow gate appears also in Mt 7:13, only there it is an
   outside gate [pules] while here it is the entrance to the house, "the
   narrow door" [thuras].

   13:25 When once [aph' hou an]. Possibly to be connected without break
   with the preceding verse (so Westcott and Hort), though Bruce argues
   for two parables here, the former (verse 24) about being in earnest,
   while this one (verses 25-30) about not being too late. The two points
   are here undoubtedly. It is an awkward construction, [aph' hou = apo
   toutou hote] with [an] and the aorist subjunctive [egerthei] and
   [apokleisei]. See Robertson, Grammar, p. 978. Hath shut to
   [apokleisei], first aorist active subjunctive of [apokleiO], old verb,
   but only here in the N.T. Note effective aorist tense and perfective
   use of [apo], slammed the door fast. And ye begin [kai arxesthe]. First
   aorist middle subjunctive of [archomai] with [aph' hou an] like
   [egerthei] and [apokleisei]. To stand [hestanai]. Second perfect active
   infinitive of [histemi], intransitive tense and to knock [kai krouein].
   Present active infinitive, to keep on knocking. Open to us [anoixon
   hemin]. First aorist active imperative, at once and urgent. He shall
   say [erei]. Future active of [eipon] (defective verb). This is probably
   the apodosis of the [aph' hou] clause.

   13:26 Shall ye begin [arxesthe]. Future middle, though Westcott and
   Hort put [arxesthe] (aorist middle subjunctive of [archomai] and in
   that case a continuation of the [aph' hou] construction. It is a
   difficult passage and the copyists had trouble with it. In thy presence
   [enOpion sou]. As guests or hosts or neighbours some claim, or the
   master of the house. It is grotesque to claim credit because Christ
   taught in their streets, but they are hard run for excuses and claims.

   13:27 I know not whence ye are [ouk oida pothen este]. This blunt
   statement cuts the matter short and sweeps away the flimsy cobwebs.
   Acquaintance with Christ in the flesh does not open the door. Jesus
   quotes Ps 8:9 as in Mt 7:23, there as in the LXX, here with [pantes
   ergatai adikias], there with [hoi ergazomenoi ten anomian]. But
   [apostete] (second aorist active imperative) here, and there
   [apochOreite] (present active imperative).

   13:28 There [ekei]. Out there, outside the house whence they are
   driven. When ye shall see [hotan opsesthe]. First aorist middle
   subjunctive (of a late aorist [Opsamen] of [horaO], though [opsesthe]
   (future middle) in margin of Westcott and Hort, unless we admit here a
   "future" subjunctive like Byzantine Greek (after Latin). And yourselves
   cast forth without [humas de ekballomenous exO]. Present passive
   participle, continuous action, "you being cast out" with the door shut.
   See on Mt 8:11f. for this same picture.

   13:29 Shall sit down [anaklithesontai]. Future passive indicative third
   plural. Recline, of course, is the figure of this heavenly banquet.
   Jesus does not mean that these will be saved in different ways, but
   only that many will come from all the four quarters of the earth.

   13:30 Last [eschatoi]. This saying was repeated many times (Mt 19:30;
   Mr 10:31; Mt 20:16).

   13:31 In that very hour [en autei tei hOrai]. Luke's favourite notation
   of time. Pharisees [Pharisaioi]. Here we see the Pharisees in a new
   role, warning Jesus against the machinations of Herod, when they are
   plotting themselves.

   13:32 That fox [tei alOpeki tautei]. This epithet for the cunning and
   cowardice of Herod shows clearly that Jesus understood the real
   attitude and character of the man who had put John the Baptist to death
   and evidently wanted to get Jesus into his power in spite of his
   superstitious fears that he might be John the Baptist redivivus.The
   message of Jesus means that he is independent of the plots and schemes
   of both Herod and the Pharisees. The preacher is often put in a tight
   place by politicians who are quite willing to see him shorn of all real
   power. Cures [iaseis]. Old word, but in the N.T. only here and Ac
   4:22,30). I am perfected [teleioumai]. Present passive indicative of
   [teleioO], old verb from [teleios], to bring to perfection, frequent in
   the N.T. Used in Heb 2:10 of the Father's purpose in the humanity of
   Christ. Perfect humanity is a process and Jesus was passing through
   that, without sin, but not without temptation and suffering. It is the
   prophetic present with the sense of the future.

   13:33 The day following [tei echomenei]. See Ac 20:15. The same as the
   third day in verse 32. A proverb. It cannot be [ouk endechetai]. It is
   not accepted, it is inadmissible. A severely ironical indictment of
   Jerusalem. The shadow of the Cross reaches Perea where Jesus now is as
   he starts toward Jerusalem.

   13:34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem [Ierousalem, Ierousalem]. In Mt 23:37f.
   Jesus utters a similar lament over Jerusalem. The connection suits both
   there and here, but Plummer considers it "rather a violent hypothesis"
   to suppose that Jesus spoke these words twice. It is possible, of
   course, though not like Luke's usual method, that he put the words here
   because of the mention of Jerusalem. In itself it is not easy to see
   why Jesus could not have made the lament both here and in Jerusalem.
   The language of the apostrophe is almost identical in both places (Lu
   13:34f.; Mt 23:37-39). For details see on Matthew. In Luke we have
   [episunaxai] (late first aorist active infinitive) and in Matthew
   [episunagagein] (second aorist active infinitive), both from
   [episunagO], a double compound of late Greek (Polybius). Both have "How
   often would I" [posakis ethelesa]. How often did I wish. Clearly
   showing that Jesus made repeated visits to Jerusalem as we know
   otherwise only from John's Gospel. Even as [hon tropon]. Accusative of
   general reference and in Mt 23:37 also. Incorporation of antecedent
   into the relative clause. Brood [nossian] is in Luke while Matthew has
   chickens [nossia], both late forms for the older [neossia]. The
   adjective desolate [eremos] is wanting in Lu 13:35 and is doubtful in
   Mt 23:39.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 14

   14:1 When he went [en tOi elthein auton]. Luke's favourite temporal
   clause = "on the going as to him." That [kai]. Another common Lukan
   idiom, [kai=hoti] after [egeneto], like Hebrew wav.They [autoi].
   Emphatic. Were watching [esan parateroumenoi]. Periphrastic imperfect
   middle. Note force of [autoi], middle voice, and [para-]. They were
   themselves watching on the side (on the sly), watching insidiously,
   with evil intent as in Mr 3:2 (active).

   14:2 Which had the dropsy [hudrOpikos]. Late and medical word from
   [hudOr] (water), one who has internal water [hudrOps]. Here only in the
   N.T. and only example of the disease healed by Jesus and recorded.

   14:3 Answering [apokritheis]. First aorist passive participle without
   the passive meaning. Jesus answered the thoughts of those mentioned in
   verse 1. Here "lawyers and Pharisees" are treated as one class with one
   article [tous] whereas in 7:30 they are treated as two classes with
   separate articles. Or not [e ou]. The dilemma forestalled any question
   by them. They held their peace [hesuchasan]. Ingressive aorist active
   of old verb [hesuchazO]. They became silent, more so than before.

   14:4 Took him [epilabomenos]. Second aorist middle participle of
   [epilambanO], an old verb, only in the middle in the N.T. It is not
   redundant use, "took and healed," but "took hold of him and healed
   him." Only instance in the N.T. of its use in a case of healing. Let
   him go [apelusen]. Probably, dismissed from the company to get him away
   from these critics.

   14:5 An ass or an ox [onos e bous]. But Westcott and Hort [huios e
   bous] (a son or an ox). The manuscripts are much divided between
   [huios] (son) and [onos] (ass) which in the abbreviated uncials looked
   much alike (TC, OC) and were much alike. The sentence in the Greek
   reads literally thus: Whose ox or ass of you shall fall [peseitai],
   future middle of [pipto] into a well and he (the man) will not
   straightway draw him up [anaspasei], future active of [anaspaO] on the
   sabbath day? The very form of the question is a powerful argument and
   puts the lawyers and the Pharisees hopelessly on the defensive.

   14:6 Could not answer again [ouk ischusan antapokrithenai]. Did not
   have strength to answer back or in turn [anti-] as in Ro 9:20). They
   could not take up the argument and were helpless. They hated to admit
   that they cared more for an ox or ass or even a son than for this poor
   dropsical man.

   14:7 A parable for those which were bidden [pros tous keklemenous
   parabolen]. Perfect passive participle of [kaleO], to call, to invite.
   This parable is for the guests who were there and who had been watching
   Jesus. When he marked [epechOn]. Present active participle of [epechO]
   with [ton noun] understood, holding the mind upon them, old verb and
   common. They chose out [exelegonto]. Imperfect middle, were picking out
   for themselves. The chief seats [tas prOtoklisias]. The first reclining
   places at the table. Jesus condemned the Pharisees later for this very
   thing (Mt 23:6; Mr 12:39; Lu 20:46). On a couch holding three the
   middle place was the chief one. At banquets today the name of the
   guests are usually placed at the plates. The place next to the host on
   the right was then, as now, the post of honour.

   14:8 Sit not down [me kataklitheis]. First aorist (ingressive) passive
   subjunctive of [kataklinO], to recline. Old verb, but peculiar to Luke
   in the N.T. (7:36; 9:14; 14:8; 24:30). Be bidden [ei keklemenos].
   Periphrastic perfect passive subjunctive of [kaleO] after [me pote].

   14:9 And say [kai erei]. Changes to future indicative with [me pote] as
   in 12:58. Shalt begin with shame [arxei meta aischunes]. The moment of
   embarrassment. To take the lowest place [ton eschaton topon katechein].
   To hold down the lowest place, all the intermediate ones being taken.

   14:10 Sit down [anapese]. Second aorist active imperative of
   [anapiptO], to fall up or back, to lie back or down. Late Greek word
   for [anaklinO] (cf. [kataklinO] in verse 8). He that hath bidden thee
   [ho keklekOs se]. Perfect active participle as in verse 12 [tOi
   keklekoti] with which compare [ho kalesas] in verse 9 (first aorist
   active participle). He may say [erei]. The future indicative with
   [hina] does occur in the Koine (papyri) and so in the N.T. (Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 984). Go up higher [prosanabethi]. Second aorist active
   imperative second singular of [prosanabainO], an old double compound
   verb, but here only in the N.T. Probably, "Come up higher," because the
   call comes from the host and because of [pros].

   14:11 Shall be humbled [tapeinOthesetai]. First future passive. One of
   the repeated sayings of Jesus (18:14; Mt 23:12).

   14:12 A dinner or a supper [ariston e deipnon]. More exactly, a
   breakfast or a dinner with distinction between them as already shown.
   This is a parable for the host as one had just been given for the
   guests, though Luke does not term this a parable. Call not [me phOnei].
   [Me] and the present imperative active, prohibiting the habit of
   inviting only friends. It is the exclusive invitation of such guests
   that Jesus condemns. There is a striking parallel to this in Plato's
   Phaedrus 233. Recompense [antapodoma]. In the form of a return
   invitation. Like [anti] in "bid thee again" [antikalesOsin].

   14:13 When thou makest a feast [hotan dochen poieis]. [Hotan] and the
   present subjunctive in an indefinite temporal clause. [Doche] means
   reception as in Lu 5:29, late word, only in these two passages in the
   N.T. Note absence of article with these adjectives in the Greek (poor
   people, maimed folks, lame people, blind people).

   14:14 To recompense thee [antapodounai soi]. Second aorist active
   infinitive of this old and common double compound verb, to give back in
   return. The reward will come at the resurrection if not before and thou
   shalt be happy.

   14:15 Blessed [makarios]. Happy, same word in the Beatitudes of Jesus
   (Mt 5:3ff.). This pious platitude whether due to ignorance or hypocrisy
   was called forth by Christ's words about the resurrection. It was a
   common figure among the rabbis, the use of a banquet for the bliss of
   heaven. This man may mean that this is a prerogative of the Pharisees.
   He assumed complacently that he will be among the number of the blest.
   Jesus himself uses this same figure of the spiritual banquet for
   heavenly bliss (Lu 22:29). Shall eat [phagetai]. Future middle from
   [esthiO], defective verb, from stem of the aorist [ephagon] like
   [edomai] of the old Greek.

   14:16 Made [epoiei]. Imperfect active, was on the point of making
   (inchoative). Great supper [deipnon]. Or dinner, a formal feast. Jesus
   takes up the conventional remark of the guest and by this parable shows
   that such an attitude was no guarantee of godliness (Bruce). This
   parable of the marriage of the King's son (Lu 14:15-24) has many points
   of likeness to the parable of the wedding garment (Mt 22:1-14) and as
   many differences also. The occasions are very different, that in
   Matthew grows out of the attempt to arrest Jesus while this one is due
   to the pious comment of a guest at the feast and the wording is also
   quite different. Hence we conclude that they are distinct parables. And
   he bade many [kai ekalesen pollous]. Aorist active, a distinct and
   definite act following the imperfect [epoiei].

   14:17 His servant [ton doulon autou]. His bondservant. Vocator or
   Summoner (Es 5:8; 6:14). This second summons was the custom then as now
   with wealthy Arabs. Tristram (Eastern Customs, p. 82) says: "To refuse
   the second summons would be an insult, which is equivalent among the
   Arab tribes to a declaration of war."

   14:18 With one consent [apo mias]. Some feminine substantive like
   [gnOmes] or [psuches] has to be supplied. This precise idiom occurs
   nowhere else. It looked like a conspiracy for each one in his turn did
   the same thing. To make excuse [paraiteisthai]. This common Greek verb
   is used in various ways, to ask something from one (Mr 15:6), to
   deprecate or ask to avert (Heb 12:19), to refuse or decline (Ac 25:11),
   to shun or to avoid (2Ti 2:23), to beg pardon or to make excuses for
   not doing or to beg (Lu 14:18ff.). All these ideas are variations of
   [aiteO], to ask in the middle voice with [para] in composition. The
   first [ho prOtos]. In order of time. There are three of the "many"
   ("all"), whose excuses are given, each more flimsy than the other. I
   must needs [echO anagken]. I have necessity. The land would still be
   there, a strange "necessity." Have me excused [eche me pareitemenon].
   An unusual idiom somewhat like the English perfect with the auxiliary
   "have" and the modern Greek idiom with [echO], but certainly not here a
   Greek periphrasis for [pareiteso]. This perfect passive participle is
   predicate and agrees with [me]. See a like idiom in Mr 3:1; Lu 12:19
   (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 902f.). The Latin had a similar idiom, habe me
   excusatum.Same language in verse 19.

   14:19 To prove them [dokimasai auta]. He could have tested them before
   buying. The oxen would not run away or be stolen.

   14:20 I cannot come [ou dunamai elthein]. Less polite than the others
   but a more plausible pretence if he wanted to make it so. The law
   excused a newly married man from war (De 24:5), "but not from social
   courtesy" (Ragg). The new wife would probably have been glad to go with
   him to the feast if asked. But see 1Co 7:33. There is here as often a
   sharp difference between the excuses offered and the reasons behind
   them.

   14:21 Being angry [orgistheis]. First aorist (ingressive) passive,
   becoming angry. Quickly [tacheOs]. The dinner is ready and no time is
   to be lost. The invitation goes still to those in the city. Streets and
   lanes [tas plateias kai rhumas]. Broadways and runways (broad streets
   and narrow lanes). Maimed [anapeirous]. So Westcott and Hort for the
   old word [anaperous], due to itacism [ei=e] in pronunciation). The word
   is compounded of [ana] and [peros], lame all the way up.

   14:22 And yet there is room [kai eti topos estin]. The Master had
   invited "many" (verse 16) who had all declined. The servant knew the
   Master wished the places to be filled.

   14:23 The highways and hedges [tas hodous kai phragmous]. The public
   roads outside the city of Judaism just as the streets and lanes were
   inside the city. The heathen are to be invited this time. Hedges is
   fenced in places from [phrassO], to fence in (Ro 3:19). Compel
   [anagkason]. First aorist active imperative of [anagkazO], from
   [anagke] (verse 18). By persuasion of course. There is no thought of
   compulsory salvation. "Not to use force, but to constrain them against
   the reluctance which such poor creatures would feel at accepting the
   invitation of a great lord" (Vincent). As examples of such "constraint"
   in this verb see Mt 14:22; Ac 26:11; Ga 6:12. That my house may be
   filled [hina gemisthei mou ho oikos]. First aorist passive subjunctive
   of [gemizO], to fill full, old verb from [gemO], to be full. Effective
   aorist. Subjunctive with [hina] in final clause. The Gentiles are to
   take the place that the Jews might have had (Ro 11:25). Bengel says:
   Nec natura nec gratia patitur vacuum.

   14:24 My supper [mou tou deipnou]. Here it is still the Master of the
   feast who is summing up his reasons for his conduct. We do not have to
   say that Jesus shuts the door now in the face of the Jews who may turn
   to him.

   14:25 And he turned [kai strapheis]. Second aorist passive participle
   of [strephO], common verb. It is a dramatic act on the part of Jesus, a
   deliberate effort to check the wild and unthinking enthusiasm of the
   crowds who followed just to be following. Note "many multitudes"
   [ochloi polloi] and the imperfect tense [suneporeuonto], were going
   along with him.

   14:26 Hateth not [ou misei]. An old and very strong verb [miseO], to
   hate, detest. The orientals use strong language where cooler spirits
   would speak of preference or indifference. But even so Jesus does not
   here mean that one must hate his father or mother of necessity or as
   such, for Mt 15:4 proves the opposite. It is only where the element of
   choice comes in (cf. Mt 6:24) as it sometimes does, when father or
   mother opposes Christ. Then one must not hesitate. The language here is
   more sharply put than in Mt 10:37. The [ou] here coalesces with the
   verb [misei] in this conditional clause of the first class determined
   as fulfilled. It is the language of exaggerated contrast, it is true,
   but it must not be watered down till the point is gone. In mentioning
   "and wife" Jesus has really made a comment on the excuse given in verse
   20 (I married a wife and so I am not able to come). And his own life
   also [eti te kai ten psuchen heautou]. Note [te kai], both--and. "The
   [te] (B L) binds all the particulars into one bundle of
   renuncianda"(Bruce). Note this same triple group of conjunctions [eti
   te kai] in Ac 21:28, "And moreover also," "even going as far as his own
   life." Martyrdom should be an ever-present possibility to the
   Christian, not to be courted, but not to be shunned. Love for Christ
   takes precedence "over even the elemental instinct of
   self-preservation" (Ragg).

   14:27 His own cross [ton stauron heauto-]. This familiar figure we have
   had already (Lu 9:23; Mr 8:34; Mt 10:38; 16:24). Each follower has a
   cross which he must bear as Jesus did his. [BastazO] is used of cross
   bearing in the N.T. only here (figuratively) and Joh 19:17 literally of
   Jesus. Crucifixion was common enough in Palestine since the days of
   Antiochus Epiphanes and Alexander Jannaeus.

   14:28 Build a tower [purgon oikodomesai]. A common metaphor, either a
   tower in the city wall like that by the Pool of Siloam (Lu 13:4) or a
   watchtower in a vineyard (Mt 21:33) or a tower-shaped building for
   refuge or ornament as here. This parable of the rash builder has the
   lesson of counting the cost. Sit down [kathisas]. Attitude of
   deliberation. First [prOton]. First things first. So in verse 31. Count
   [psephizei]. Common verb in late writers, but only here and Re 13:18 in
   the N.T. The verb is from [psephos], a stone, which was used in voting
   and so counting. Calculate is from the Latin calculus, a pebble. To
   vote was to cast a pebble [tithemi psephon]. Luke has Paul using
   "deposit a pebble" for casting his vote (Ac 26:10). The cost [ten
   dapanen]. Old and common word, but here only in the N.T. from [daptO],
   to tear, consume, devour. Expense is something which eats up one's
   resources. Whether he hath wherewith to complete it [ei echei eis
   apartismon]. If he has anything for completion of it. [Apartismon] is a
   rare and late word (in the papyri and only here in the N.T.). It is
   from [apartizO], to finish off [ap-] and [artizO] like our articulate),
   to make even or square. Cf. [exertismenos] in 2Ti 3:17.

   14:29 Lest haply [hina mepote]. Double final particles (positive and
   negative with addition of [pote]. Used here with aorist middle
   subjunctive in [arxOntai] (begin). When he hath laid ... and was not
   able [thentos autou ... kai me ischuontos] to finish [ektelesai]. First
   aorist active infinitive. Note perfective use of [ek], to finish out to
   the end. Two genitive absolutes, first, second aorist active participle
   [thentos]; second, present active participle [ischuontos]. To mock him
   [autOi empaizein]. An old verb, [em-paizO], to play like a child
   [pais], at or with, to mock, scoff at, to trifle with like Latin
   illudere.

   14:30 This man [houtos ho anthrOpos]. This fellow, contemptuous or
   sarcastic use of [houtos].

   14:31 To encounter [sunbalein]. Second aorist active infinitive of
   [sunballO], old and common verb, to throw or bring together, to
   dispute, to clash in war as here. Another king [heterOi basilei], to
   grapple with another king in war or for war [eis polemon]. Associative
   instrumental case. Take counsel [bouleusetai]. Future middle indicative
   of old and common verb [bouleuO], from [boule], will, counsel. The
   middle means to take counsel with oneself, to deliberate, to ponder.
   With ten thousand [en deka chiliasin]. Literally, in ten thousand. See
   this so-called instrumental use of [en] in Jude 1:14. Equipped in or
   with ten thousand. See Lu 1:17. Note [meta eikosi chiliadOn] just below
   (midst of twenty thousand). To meet [hupantesai]. Common verb (like
   [apantaO] from [antaO] [anta], end, face to face, from which [anti]
   with preposition [hupo] (or [apo], to go to meet. Here it has a
   military meaning.

   14:32 Or else [ei de mege]. Same idiom in 5:36. Luke is fond of this
   formula. An ambassage [presbeian]. Old and common word for the office
   of ambassador, composed of old men [presbeis] like Japanese Elder
   Statesmen who are supposed to possess wisdom. In the N.T. only here and
   Lu 19:14. Asketh conditions of peace [erOtai pros eirenen]. The use of
   [erOtaO] in this sense of beg or petition is common in the papyri and
   Koine generally. The original use of asking a question survives also.
   The text is uncertain concerning [pros eirenen] which means with
   [erOtaO], to ask negotiations for peace. In B we have [eis] instead of
   [pros] like verse 28. Most MSS. have [ta] before [pros] or [eis], but
   not in Aleph and B. It is possible that the [ta] was omitted because of
   preceding [tai] [homoeoteleuton], but the sense is the same. See Ro
   14:19 [ta tes eirenes], the things of peace, which concern or look
   towards peace, the preliminaries of peace.

   14:33 Renounceth not [ouk apotassetai]. Old Greek word to set apart as
   in a military camp, then in the middle voice to separate oneself from,
   say good-bye to (Lu 9:61), to renounce, forsake, as here. All that he
   hath [pasin tois heautou huparchousin]. Dative case, says good-bye to
   all his property, "all his own belongings" (neuter plural participle
   used as substantive) as named in verse 26. This verse gives the
   principle in the two parables of the rash builder and of the rash king.
   The minor details do not matter. The spirit of self-sacrifice is the
   point.

   14:35 Dunghill [koprian]. Later word in the Koine vernacular. Here only
   in the N.T., though in the LXX. Men cast it out [exO ballousin auto].
   Impersonal plural. This saying about salt is another of Christ's
   repeated sayings (Mt 5:13; Mr 9:50). Another repeated saying is the one
   here about having ears to hear (Lu 8:8; 14:35; Mt 11:15; 13:43).
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 15

   15:1 All the publicans and sinners [pantes hoi telOnai kai hoi
   hamartOloi]. The two articles separate the two classes (all the
   publicans and the sinners). They are sometimes grouped together (5:30;
   Mt 9:11), but not here. The publicans are put on the same level with
   the outcasts or sinners. So in verse 2 the repeated article separates
   Pharisees and scribes as not quite one. The use of "all" here may be
   hyperbole for very many or the reference may be to these two classes in
   the particular place where Jesus was from time to time. Were drawing
   near unto him [esan autOi eggizontes]. Periphrastic imperfect of
   [eggizO], from [eggus] (near), late verb. For to hear [akouein]. Just
   the present active infinitive of purpose.

   15:2 Both . . . and [te . . . kai]. United in the complaint. Murmured
   [diegogguzon]. Imperfect active of [diagogguzO], late Greek compound in
   the LXX and Byzantine writers. In the N.T. only here and Lu 19:7. The
   force of [dia] here is probably between or among themselves. It spread
   (imperfect tense) whenever these two classes came in contact with
   Jesus. As the publicans and the sinners were drawing near to Jesus just
   in that proportion the Pharisees and the scribes increased their
   murmurings. The social breach is here an open yawning chasm. This man
   [houtos]. A contemptuous sneer in the use of the pronoun. They spoke
   out openly and probably pointed at Jesus. Receiveth [prosdechetai].
   Present middle indicative of the common verb [prosdechomai]. In 12:36
   we had it for expecting, here it is to give access to oneself, to
   welcome like [hupedexato] of Martha's welcome to Jesus (Lu 10:38). The
   charge here is that this is the habit of Jesus. He shows no sense of
   social superiority to these outcasts (like the Hindu "untouchables" in
   India). And eateth with them [kai sunesthiei autois]. Associative
   instrumental case [autois] after [sun-] in composition. This is an old
   charge (Lu 5:30) and a much more serious breach from the standpoint of
   the Pharisees. The implication is that Jesus prefers these outcasts to
   the respectable classes (the Pharisees and the scribes) because he is
   like them in character and tastes, even with the harlots. There was a
   sting in the charge that he was the "friend" [philos] of publicans and
   sinners (Lu 7:34).

   15:3 This parable [ten parabolen tauten]. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
   (15:3-7). This is Christ's way of answering the cavilling of these
   chronic complainers. Jesus gave this same parable for another purpose
   in another connection (Mt 18:12-14). The figure of the Good Shepherd
   appears also in Joh 10:1-18. "No simile has taken more hold upon the
   mind of Christendom" (Plummer). Jesus champions the lost and accepts
   the challenge and justifies his conduct by these superb stories. "The
   three Episodes form a climax: The Pasture--the House--the Home; the
   Herdsman--the Housewife--the Father; the Sheep--the Treasure--the
   Beloved Son" (Ragg).

   15:4 In the wilderness [en tei eremOi]. Their usual pasturage, not a
   place of danger or peril. It is the owner of the hundred sheep who
   cares so much for the one that is lost. He knows each one of the sheep
   and loves each one. Go after that which is lost [poreuetai epi to
   apolOlos]. The one lost sheep [apolOlos], second perfect active
   participle of [apollumi], to destroy, but intransitive, to be lost).
   There is nothing more helpless than a lost sheep except a lost sinner.
   The sheep went off by its own ignorance and folly. The use of [epi] for
   the goal occurs also in Mt 22:9; Ac 8:26; 9:11. Until he find it [heOs
   heurei auto]. Second aorist active subjunctive of [heuriskO], common
   verb, with [heOs], common Greek idiom. He keeps on going [poreuetai],
   linear present middle indicative) until success comes (effective
   aorist, [heurei].

   15:5 On his shoulders [epi tous Omous autou]. He does it himself in
   exuberant affection and of necessity as the poor lost sheep is
   helpless. Note the plural shoulders showing that the sheep was just
   back of the shepherd's neck and drawn around by both hands. The word
   for shoulder [Omos] is old and common, but in the N.T. only here and Mt
   23:4. Rejoicing [chairOn]. "There is no upbraiding of the wandering
   sheep, nor murmuring at the trouble" (Plummer).

   15:6 Rejoice with me [suncharete moi]. Second aorist passive of
   [sunchairO], an old and common verb for mutual joy as in Php 2:17f. Joy
   demands fellowship. Same form in verse 9. So the shepherd calls
   together [sunkalei], note [sun] again) both his friends and his
   neighbours. This picture of the Good Shepherd has captured the eye of
   many artists through the ages.

   15:7 Over one sinner that repenteth [epi heni hamartOlOi metanoounti].
   The word sinner points to verse 1. Repenting is what these sinners were
   doing, these lost sheep brought to the fold. The joy in heaven is in
   contrast with the grumbling Pharisees and scribes. More than over [e
   epi]. There is no comparative in the Greek. It is only implied by a
   common idiom like our "rather than." Which need no repentance [hoitines
   ou chreian echousin metanoias]. Jesus does not mean to say that the
   Pharisees and the scribes do not need repentance or are perfect. He for
   the sake of argument accepts their claims about themselves and by their
   own words condemns them for their criticism of his efforts to save the
   lost sheep. It is the same point that he made against them when they
   criticized Jesus and the disciples for being at Levi's feast (Lu
   5:31f.). They posed as "righteous." Very well, then. That shuts their
   mouths on the point of Christ's saving the publicans and sinners.

   15:8 Ten pieces of silver [drachmas deka]. The only instance in the
   N.T. of this old word for a coin of 65.5 grains about the value of the
   common [denarius] (about eighteen cents), a quarter of a Jewish shekel.
   The double drachma [didrachmon] occurs in the N.T. only in Mt 17:24.
   The root is from [drassomai], to grasp with the hand (1Co 3:19), and so
   a handful of coin. Ten drachmas would be equal to nearly two dollars,
   but in purchasing power much more. Sweep [saroi]. A late colloquial
   verb [saroO] for the earlier [sairO], to clear by sweeping. Three times
   in the N.T. (Lu 11:25; 15:8; Mt 12:44). The house was probably with out
   windows (only the door for light and hence the lamp lit) and probably
   also a dirt floor. Hence Bengel says: non sine pulvere.This parable is
   peculiar to Luke.

   15:9 Her friends and neighbours [tas philas kai geitonas]. Note single
   article and female friends (feminine article and [philas]. [HeOs hou
   eurei] here as in verse 4, only [hou] added after [heOs] (until which
   time) as often. Which I lost [hen apOlesa]. First aorist active
   indicative of [apollumi]. She lost the coin (note article). The
   shepherd did not lose the one sheep.

   15:10 There is joy [ginetai chara]. More exactly, joy arises.
   Futuristic present of [ginomai] (cf. [estai] in verse 7). In the
   presence of the angels of God [enOpion tOn aggelOn tou theou]. That is
   to say, the joy of God himself. The angels are in a sense the
   neighbours of God.

   15:11 Had [eichen]. Imperfect active. Note [echOn] (verse 4), [echousa]
   (verse 8), and now [eichen]. The self-sacrificing care is that of the
   owner in each case. Here (verses 11-32) we have the most famous of all
   the parables of Jesus, the Prodigal Son, which is in Luke alone. We
   have had the Lost Sheep, the Lost Coin, and now the Lost Son. Bruce
   notes that in the moral sphere there must be self-recovery to give
   ethical value to the rescue of the son who wandered away. That comes
   out beautifully in this allegory.

   15:12 The portion [to meros]. The Jewish law alloted one-half as much
   to the younger son as to the elder, that is to say one-third of the
   estate (De 21:17) at the death of the father. The father did not have
   to abdicate in favour of the sons, but "this very human parable here
   depicts the impatience of home restraints and the optimistic ambition
   of youth" (Ragg). And he divided [ho de dieilen]. The second aorist
   active indicative of [diaireO], an old and common verb to part in two,
   cut asunder, divide, but in the N.T. only here and 1Co 12:11. The elder
   son got his share also of the "substance" or property or estate [tes
   ousias], "the living" [ton bion] as in Mr 12:44, not "life" as in Lu
   8:14.

   15:13 Not many days after [met' ou pollas hemeras]. Literally, after
   not many days. Luke is fond of this idiom (7:6; Ac 1:5). Took his
   journey [apedemesen]. First aorist active indicative of [apodemeO]
   (from [apodemos], away from home). Common verb. In the N.T. here and Mt
   21:33; 25:14; Mr 12:1; Lu 20:9. He burned all his bridges behind him,
   gathering together all that he had. Wasted [dieskorpisen]. First aorist
   active indicative of [diaskorpizO], a somewhat rare verb, the very
   opposite of "gathered together" [sunagogOn]. More exactly he scattered
   his property. It is the word used of winnowing grain (Mt 25:24). With
   riotous living [zOn asOtOs]. Living dissolutely or profligately. The
   late adverb [asOtOs] (only here in the N.T.) from the common adjective
   [asOtos] [a] privative and [sOzO], one that cannot be saved, one who
   does not save, a spendthrift, an abandoned man, a profligate, a
   prodigal. He went the limit of sinful excesses. It makes sense taken
   actively or passively (prodigus or perditus), active probably here.

   15:14 When he had spent [dapanesantos autou]. Genitive absolute. The
   verb is here used in a bad sense as in Jas 4:3. See on [dapane\ Lu
   14:28. He [autos]. Emphasis. To be in want [hustereisthai]. The verb is
   from [husteros], behind or later (comparative). We use "fall behind"
   (Vincent) of one in straitened circumstances. Plummer notes the
   coincidences of Providence. The very land was in a famine when the boy
   had spent all.

   15:15 Joined himself [ekollethe]. First aorist passive of [kollaO], an
   old verb to glue together, to cleave to. In the N.T. only the passive
   occurs. He was glued to, was joined to. It is not necessary to take
   this passive in the middle reflexive sense. The citizens [tOn politOn].
   Curiously enough this common word citizen [polites] from [polis], city)
   is found in the N.T. only in Luke's writings (15:15; 19:14; Ac 21:39)
   except in He 8:11 where it is quoted from Jer 38:34. To feed swine
   [boskein choirous]. A most degrading occupation for anyone and for a
   Jew an unspeakable degradation.

   15:16 He would fain have been filled [epethumei chortasthenai].
   Literally, he was desiring (longing) to be filled. Imperfect indicative
   and first aorist passive infinitive. [Chortasthenai] is from [chortazO]
   and that from [chortos] (grass), and so to feed with grass or with
   anything. Westcott and Hort put [gemisai ten koilian autou] in the
   margin (the Textus Receptus). With the husks [ek tOn keratiOn]. The
   word occurs here alone in the N.T. and is a diminutive of [keras]
   (horn) and so means little horn. It is used in various senses, but here
   refers to the pods of the carob tree or locust tree still common in
   Palestine and around the Mediterannean, so called from the shape of the
   pods like little horns, Bockshornbaum in German or goat's-horn tree.
   The gelatinous substance inside has a sweetish taste and is used for
   feeding swine and even for food by the lower classes. It is sometimes
   called Saint John's Bread from the notion that the Baptist ate it in
   the wilderness. No man gave unto him [oudeis edidou autOi]. Imperfect
   active. Continued refusal of anyone to allow him even the food of the
   hogs.

   15:17 But when he came to himself [eis heauton de elthOn]. As if he had
   been far from himself as he was from home. As a matter of fact he had
   been away, out of his head, and now began to see things as they really
   were. Plato is quoted by Ackerman (Christian Element in Plato) as
   thinking of redemption as coming to oneself. Hired servants [misthioi].
   A late word from [misthos] (hire). In the N.T. only in this chapter.
   The use of "many" here suggests a wealthy and luxurious home. Have
   bread enough and to spare [perisseuontai artOn]. Old verb from
   [perissos] and that from [peri] (around). Present passive here, "are
   surrounded by loaves" like a flood. I perish [egO de limOi hOde
   apollumai]. Every word here counts: While I on the other hand am here
   perishing with hunger. It is the linear present middle of [apollumi].
   Note [egO] expressed and [de] of contrast.

   15:18 I will arise and go [anastas proreusomai]. This determination is
   the act of the will after he comes to himself and sees his real
   condition. I did sin [hemarton]. That is the hard word to say and he
   will say it first. The word means to miss the mark. I shot my bolt and
   I missed my aim (compare the high-handed demand in verse 12).

   15:19 No longer worthy [ouketi axios]. Confession of the facts. He sees
   his own pitiful plight and is humble. As one [hOs hena]. The hired
   servants in his father's house are high above him now.

   15:20 To his father [pros ton patera heautou]. Literally, to his own
   father. He acted at once on his decision. Yet afar off [eti autou
   makran apechontos]. Genitive absolute. [Makran] agrees with [hodon]
   understood: While he was yet holding off a distant way. This shows that
   the father had been looking for him to come back and was even looking
   at this very moment as he came in sight. Ran [dramOn]. Second aorist
   active participle of the defective verb [trechO]. The eager look and
   longing of the father. Kissed [katephilesen]. Note perfective use of
   [kata] kissed him much, kissed him again and again. The verb occurs so
   in the older Greek.

   15:21 The son made his speech of confession as planned, but it is not
   certain that he was able to finish as a number of early manuscripts do
   not have "Make me as one of the hired servants," though Aleph B D do
   have them. It is probable that the father interrupted him at this point
   before he could finish.

   15:22 The best robe [stolen ten prOten]. [Stole] is an old word for a
   fine stately garment that comes down to the feet (from [stello], to
   prepare, equip), the kind worn by kings (Mr 16:5; Lu 22:46). Literally,
   "a robe the first." But not the first that you find, but the first in
   rank and value, the finest in the house. This in contrast with his
   shabby clothes. A ring [daktulion]. Common in classical writers and the
   LXX, but here only in the N.T. From [daktulos], finger. See
   [chrusodaktulios] in Jas 2:2. Shoes [hupodemata]. Sandals, "bound
   under." Both sandals and ring are marks of the freeman as slaves were
   barefooted.

   15:23 The fatted calf [ton moschon ton siteuton]. The calf the fatted
   one. [Siteuton] is the verbal adjective of [sileuO], to feed with wheat
   [sitos]. The calf was kept fat for festive occasions, possibly in the
   hope of the son's return. Kill [thusate]. Not as a sacrifice, but for
   the feast. Make merry [euphranthOmen]. First aorist passive subjunctive
   (volitive). From [euphrainO], an old verb from [eu] (well) and [phren]
   (mind).

   15:24 And is alive [kai anezesen]. First aorist active indicative of
   [anazaO], to live again. Literally, he was dead and he came back to
   life. He was lost [en apolOlOs], periphrastic past perfect active of
   [apollumi] and intransitive, in a lost state) and he was found
   [heurethe]. He was found, we have to say, but this aorist passive is
   really timeless, he is found after long waiting (effective aorist) The
   artists have vied with each other in picturing various items connected
   with this wonderful parable.

   15:25 As he came and drew nigh [hOs erchomenos eggisen]. More exactly,
   "As, coming, he drew nigh," for [erchomenos] is present middle
   participle and [eggisen] is aorist active indicative. Music
   [sumphOnias]. Our word "symphony." An old Greek word from [sumphOnos]
   [sun], together, and [phOne], voice or sound), harmony, concord, by a
   band of musicians. Here alone in the N.T. And dancing [kai chorOn]. An
   old word again, but here alone in the N.T. Origin uncertain, possibly
   from [orchos] by metathesis [orcheomai], to dance). A circular dance on
   the green.

   15:26 Servants [paidOn]. Not [douloi] (bondslaves) as in verse 22. The
   Greeks often used [pais] for servant like the Latin puer.It could be
   either a hired servant [misthios], verse 17) or slave [doulos]. He
   inquired (epunthaneto]. Imperfect middle, inquired repeatedly and
   eagerly. What these things might be [ti an eie tauta]. Not "poor" Greek
   as Easton holds, but simply the form of the direct question retained in
   the indirect. See the direct form as the apodosis of a condition of the
   fourth class in Ac 17:18. In Ac 10:17 we have the construction with [an
   eie] of the direct retained in the indirect question. So also in Lu
   1:62: See Robertson, Grammar, p. 1044.

   15:27 Is come [hekei]. Present indicative active, but a stem with
   perfect sense, old verb [hekO] retaining this use after perfect tenses
   came into use (Robertson, Grammar, p. 893). Hath killed [ethusen].
   Aorist active indicative and literally means, did kill. Difficult to
   handle in English for our tenses do not correspond with the Greek. Hath
   received [apelaben]. Second aorist active indicative with similar
   difficulty of translation. Note [apo] in compositions, like re- in
   "receive," hath gotten him back [ap-]. Safe and sound [hugiainonta].
   Present active participle of [hugiainO] from [hugies], to be in good
   health. In spite of all that he has gone through and in spite of the
   father's fears.

   15:28 But he was angry [Orgisthe]. First aorist (ingressive) passive
   indicative. But he became angry, he flew into a rage [orge]. This was
   the explosion as the result of long resentment towards the wayward
   brother and suspicion of the father's partiality for the erring son.
   Would not go in [ouk ethelen eiselthein]. Imperfect tense (was not
   willing, refused) and aorist active (ingressive) infinitive. Entreated
   [parekalei]. Imperfect tense, he kept on beseeching him.

   15:29 Do I serve thee [douleuO soi]. Progressive present tense of this
   old verb from [doulos] (slave) which the elder son uses to picture his
   virtual slavery in staying at home and perhaps with longings to follow
   the younger son (Robertson, Grammar, p. 879). Transgressed [parelthon].
   Second aorist active indicative of [parerchomai], to pass by. Not even
   once (aorist) in contrast with so many years of service (linear
   present). A kid [eriphon]. Some MSS. have [eriphion], diminutive, a
   little kid. So margin of Westcott and Hort. B has it also in Mt 25:32,
   the only other N.T. passage where the word occurs. That I might make
   merry [hina euphranthO]. Final clause, first aorist passive subjunctive
   of the same verb used in verses 23, 25.

   15:30 This thy son [ho huios sou houtos]. Contempt and sarcasm. He does
   not say: "This my brother." Came [elthen]. He does not even say, came
   back or came home. Devoured [kataphagOn]. We say, "eaten up," but the
   Greek has, "eaten down" (perfective use of [kata-]. Suggested by the
   feasting going on. With harlots [meta pornOn]. This may be true (verse
   13), but the elder son did not know it to be true. He may reflect what
   he would have done in like case.

   15:31 Son [Teknon]. Child. Thou [su]. Expressed and in emphatic
   position in the sentence. He had not appreciated his privileges at home
   with his father.

   15:32 It was meet [edei]. Imperfect tense. It expressed a necessity in
   the father's heart and in the joy of the return that justifies the
   feasting. [Euphranthenai] is used again (first aorist passive
   infinitive) and [charenai] (second aorist passive infinitive) is more
   than mere hilarity, deep-seated joy. The father repeats to the elder
   son the language of his heart used in verse 24 to his servants. A real
   father could do no less. One can well imagine how completely the
   Pharisees and scribes (verse 2) were put to silence by these three
   marvellous parables. The third does it with a graphic picture of their
   own attitude in the case of the surly elder brother. Luke was called a
   painter by the ancients. Certainly he has produced a graphic pen
   picture here of God's love for the lost that justifies forever the
   coming of Christ to the world to seek and to save the lost. It
   glorifies also soul-saving on the part of his followers who are willing
   to go with Jesus after the lost in city and country, in every land and
   of every race.

Chapter 16

   16:1 Unto the disciples [kai pros tous mathetas]. The three preceding
   parables in chapter 15 exposed the special faults of the Pharisees,
   "their hard exclusiveness, self-righteousness, and contempt for others"
   (Plummer). This parable is given by Luke alone. The [kai] (also) is not
   translated in the Revised Version. It seems to mean that at this same
   time, after speaking to the Pharisees (chapter 15), Jesus proceeds to
   speak a parable to the disciples (16:1-13), the parable of the Unjust
   Steward. It is a hard parable to explain, but Jesus opens the door by
   the key in verse 9. Which had a steward [hos eichen oikonomon].
   Imperfect active, continued to have. Steward is house-manager or
   overseer of an estate as already seen in Lu 12:42. Was accused
   [dieblethe]. First aorist indicative passive, of [diaballO], an old
   verb, but here only in the N.T. It means to throw across or back and
   forth, rocks or words and so to slander by gossip. The word implies
   malice even if the thing said is true. The word [diabolos] (slanderer)
   is this same root and it is used even of women, she-devils (1Ti 3:11.
   That he was wasting [hOs diaskorpizOn]. For the verb see on 15:13. The
   use of [hOs] with the participle is a fine Greek idiom for giving the
   alleged ground of a charge against one. His goods [ta huparchonta
   autou]. "His belongings," a Lukan idiom.

   16:2 What is this that I hear? [ti touto akouO;]. There are several
   ways of understanding this terse Greek idiom. The Revised Version
   (above) takes [ti] to be equal to [ti estin touto ho akouO]; That is a
   possible use of the predicate [touto]. Another way is to take [ti] to
   be exclamatory, which is less likely. Still another view is that [ti]
   is " Why": "Why do I hear this about thee?" See Ac 14:15 where that is
   the idiom employed. Render [apodos]. Second aorist active imperative of
   [apodidOmi], Give back (and at once). The account [ton logon]. The
   reckoning or report. Common use of [logos]. Stewardship [oikonomias].
   Same root as [oikonomos] (steward). This demand does not necessarily
   mean dismissal if investigation proved him innocent of the charges. But
   the reason given implies that he is to be dismissed: Thou canst no
   longer [ou gar dunei].

   16:3 Within himself [en heautOi]. As soon as he had time to think the
   thing over carefully. He knew that he was guilty of embezzlement of the
   Master's funds. Taketh away [aphaireitai]. Present (linear) middle
   indicative of [aphaireO], old verb to take away. Here the middle
   present means, He is taking away for himself. To beg I am not ashamed
   [epaitein aischunomai]. The infinitive with [aischunomai] means ashamed
   to begin to beg. The participle, [epaitOn aischunomai] would mean,
   ashamed while begging, ashamed of begging while doing it.

   16:4 I am resolved [egnOn]. Second aorist active indicative of
   [ginOskO]. A difficult tense to reproduce in English. I knew, I know, I
   have known, all miss it a bit. It is a burst of daylight to the
   puzzled, darkened man: I've got it, I see into it now, a sudden
   solution. What to do [ti poiesO]. Either deliberative first aorist
   active subjunctive or deliberative future active indicative. When I am
   put out [hotan metastathO]. First aorist passive subjunctive of
   [methistemi], [meta, histemi], old verb, to transpose, transfer,
   remove. He is expecting to be put out. They may receive me [dexOntai].
   First aorist middle subjunctive of [dechomai], common verb. Subjunctive
   with final particle [hina]. He wishes to put the debtors under
   obligation to himself. Debtors [tOn chreophiletOn]. A late word. In the
   N.T. only here and Lu 7:41 from [chreos], loan, and [opheiletes],
   debtor. It is probable that he dealt with "each one" separately.

   16:6 Measures [batous]. Transliterated word for Hebrew bath, between
   eight and nine gallons. Here alone in the N.T. Not the same word as
   [batos] (bush) in Lu 6:44. Thy bond [sou ta grammata]. Thy writings,
   thy contracts, thy note. Quickly [tacheOs]. It was a secret arrangement
   and speed was essential.

   16:7 Measures [korous]. Another Hebrew word for dry measure. The Hebrew
   cor was about ten bushels. Data are not clear about the Hebrew measures
   whether liquid (bath) or dry (cor).

   16:8 His lord commended [epeinesen ho kurios]. The steward's lord
   praised him though he himself had been wronged again (see verse 1
   "wasting his goods"). The unrighteous steward [ton oikonomon tes
   adikias]. Literally, the steward of unrighteousness. The genitive is
   the case of genus, species, the steward distinguished by
   unrighteousness as his characteristic. See "the mammon of
   unrighteousness" in verse 9. See "the forgetful hearer" in Jas 1:25. It
   is a vernacular idiom common to Hebrew, Aramaic, and the Koine.Wisely
   [phronimOs]. An old adverb, though here alone in the N.T. But the
   adjective [phronimos] from which it comes occurs a dozen times as in Mt
   10:16. It is from [phroneO] and that from [phren], the mind (1Co
   14:20), the discerning intellect. Perhaps "shrewdly" or "discreetly" is
   better here than "wisely." The lord does not absolve the steward from
   guilt and he was apparently dismissed from his service. His shrewdness
   consisted in finding a place to go by his shrewdness. He remained the
   steward of unrighteousness even though his shrewdness was commended.
   For [hoti]. Probably by this second [hoti] Jesus means to say that he
   cites this example of shrewdness because it illustrates the point.
   "This is the moral of the whole parable. Men of the world in their
   dealings with men like themselves are more prudent than the children of
   light in their intercourse with one another" (Plummer). We all know how
   stupid Christians can be in their co-operative work in the kingdom of
   God, to go no further. Wiser than [phronimOteroi huper]. Shrewder
   beyond, a common Greek idiom.

   16:9 By the mammon of unrighteousness [ek tou mamOna tes adikias]. By
   the use of what is so often evil (money). In Mt 6:24 mammon is set over
   against God as in Lu 16:13 below. Jesus knows the evil power in money,
   but servants of God have to use it for the kingdom of God. They should
   use it discreetly and it is proper to make friends by the use of it.
   When it shall fail [hotan eklipei]. Second aorist active subjunctive
   with [hotan], future time. The mammon is sure to fail. That they may
   receive you into the eternal tabernacles [hina dexOntai humas eis tas
   aiOnious skenas]. This is the purpose of Christ in giving the advice
   about their making friends by the use of money. The purpose is that
   those who have been blessed and helped by the money may give a welcome
   to their benefactors when they reach heaven. There is no thought here
   of purchasing an entrance into heaven by the use of money. That idea is
   wholly foreign to the context. These friends will give a hearty welcome
   when one gives him mammon here. The wise way to lay up treasure in
   heaven is to use one's money for God here on earth. That will give a
   cash account there of joyful welcome, not of purchased entrance.

   16:10 Faithful in a very little [pistos en elachistOi]. Elative
   superlative. One of the profoundest sayings of Christ. We see it in
   business life. The man who can be trusted in a very small thing will be
   promoted to large responsibilities. That is the way men climb to the
   top. Men who embezzle in large sums began with small sums. Verses 10-13
   here explain the point of the preceding parables.

   16:11 Faithful in the unrighteous mammon [en tOi adikOi mamOnai]. In
   the use of what is considered "unrighteous" as it so often is.
   Condition of the first class, "if ye did not prove to be" [ei ouk
   egenesthe]. Failure here forfeits confidence in "the true riches" [to
   alethinon]. There is no sadder story than to see a preacher go down by
   the wrong use of money, caught in this snare of the devil.

   16:12 That which is your own [to h-meteron]. But Westcott and Hort read
   [to hemeteron] (our own) because of B L Origen. The difference is due
   to itacism in the pronunciation of [h--] and [he] alike (long [i]. But
   the point in the passage calls for "yours" as correct. Earthly wealth
   is ours as a loan, a trust, withdrawn at any moment. It belongs to
   another [en tOi allotriOi]. If you did not prove faithful in this, who
   will give you what is really yours forever? Compare "rich toward God"
   (Lu 12:21).

   16:13 Servant [oiketes]. Household [oikos] servant. This is the only
   addition to Mt 6:24 where otherwise the language is precisely the same,
   which see. Either Matthew or Luke has put the [logion] in the wrong
   place or Jesus spoke it twice. It suits perfectly each context. There
   is no real reason for objecting to repetition of favourite sayings by
   Jesus.

   16:14 Who were lovers of money [philarguroi huparchontes]. Literally,
   being lovers of money. [Philarguroi] is an old word, but in the N.T.
   only here and 2Ti 3:2. It is from [philos] and [arguros]. Heard
   [ekouon]. Imperfect active, were listening (all the while Jesus was
   talking to the disciples (verses 1-13). And they scoffed at him[kai
   exemukterizon]. Imperfect active again of [ekmukterizO]. LXX where late
   writers use simple verb. In the N.T. only here and Lu 23:35. It means
   to turn out or up the nose at one, to sneer, to scoff. The Romans had a
   phrase, naso adunco suspendere, to hang on the hooked nose (the subject
   of ridicule). These money-loving Pharisees were quick to see that the
   words of Jesus about the wise use of money applied to them. They had
   stood without comment the three parables aimed directly at them (the
   lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son). But now they do not remain
   quiet while they hear the fourth parable spoken to the disciples. No
   words were apparently spoken, but their eyes, noses, faces were
   eloquent with a fine disdain.

   16:15 That justify yourselves [hoi dikaiountes heautous]. They were
   past-masters at that and were doing it now by upturned noses. An
   abomination in the sight of God [bdelugma enOpion tou theou]. See on Mt
   24:15; Mr 13:14 for this LXX word for a detestable thing as when
   Antiochus Epiphanes set up an altar to Zeus in place of that to
   Jehovah. There is withering scorn in the use of this phrase by Jesus to
   these pious pretenders.

   16:16 Entereth violently into it [eis auten biazetai]. A corresponding
   saying occurs in Mt 11:12 in a very different context. In both the verb
   [biazetai], occurs also, but nowhere else in the N.T. It is present
   middle here and can be middle or passive in Matthew, which see. It is
   rare in late prose. Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 258) cites an
   inscription where [biazomai] is reflexive middle and used absolutely.
   Here the meaning clearly is that everyone forces his way into the
   kingdom of God, a plea for moral enthusiasm and spiritual passion and
   energy that some today affect to despise.

   16:17 One tittle [mian kerean]. See on Mt 5:18.

   16:18 Committeth adultery [moicheuei]. Another repeated saying of
   Christ (Mt 5:32; Mr 10:11f.; Mt 19:9f.). Adultery remains adultery,
   divorce or no divorce, remarriage or no marriage.

   16:19 He was clothed [enedidusketo]. Imperfect middle of [endiduskO], a
   late intensive form of [enduO]. He clothed himself in or with. It was
   his habit. Purple [porphuran]. This purple dye was obtained from the
   purple fish, a species of mussel or [murex] (1Macc. 4:23). It was very
   costly and was used for the upper garment by the wealthy and princes
   (royal purple). They had three shades of purple (deep violet, deep
   scarlet or crimson, deep blue). See also Mr 15:17,20; Re 18:12. Fine
   linen [busson]. Byssus or Egyptian flax (India and Achaia also). It is
   a yellowed flax from which fine linen was made for undergarments. It
   was used for wrapping mummies. "Some of the Egyptian linen was so fine
   that it was called woven air"(Vincent). Here only in the N.T. for the
   adjective [bussinos] occurs in Re 18:12; 19:8,14. Faring sumptuously
   [euphrainomenos lamprOs]. Making merry brilliantly. The verb
   [euphrainomai] we have already had in 12:19; 15:23,25,32. [LamprOs] is
   an old adverb from [lampros], brilliant, shining, splendid,
   magnificent. It occurs here only in the N.T. This parable apparently
   was meant for the Pharisees (verse 14) who were lovers of money. It
   shows the wrong use of money and opportunity.

   16:20 Beggar [ptOchos]. Original meaning of this old word. See on Mt
   5:3. The name Lazarus is from [Eleazaros], "God a help," and was a
   common one. Lazar in English means one afflicted with a pestilential
   disease. Was laid [ebebleto]. Past perfect passive of the common verb
   [ballO]. He had been flung there and was still there, "as if
   contemptuous roughness is implied" (Plummer). At his gate [pros ton
   pulOna autou]. Right in front of the large portico or gateway, not
   necessarily a part of the grand house, porch in Mt 26:71. Full of sores
   [heilkOmenos]. Perfect passive participle of [helkoO], to make sore, to
   ulcerate, from [helkos], ulcer (Latin ulcus). See use of [helkos] in
   verse 21. Common in Hippocrates and other medical writers. Here only in
   the N.T.

   16:21 With the crumbs that fell [apo tOn piptontOn]. From the things
   that fell from time to time. The language reminds one of Lu 15:16 (the
   prodigal son) and the Syro-Phoenician woman (Mr 7:28). Only it does not
   follow that this beggar did not get the scraps from the rich man's
   table. Probably he did, though nothing more. Even the wild street dogs
   would get them also. Yea, even the dogs [alla kai hoi kunes]. For [alla
   kai] see also 12:7; 24:22. [Alla] can mean "yea," though it often means
   "but." Here it depends on how one construes Luke's meaning. If he means
   that he was dependent on casual scraps and it was so bad that even the
   wild dogs moreover were his companions in misery, the climax came that
   he was able to drive away the dogs. The other view is that his hunger
   was unsatisfied, but even the dogs increased his misery. Licked his
   sores [epeleichon ta helke autou]. Imperfect active of [epileichO], a
   late vernacular Koine verb, to lick over the surface. It is not clear
   whether the licking of the sores by the dogs added to the misery of
   Lazarus or gave a measure of comfort, as he lay in his helpless
   condition. "Furrer speaks of witnessing dogs and lepers waiting
   together for the refuse" (Bruce). It was a scramble between the dogs
   and Lazarus.

   16:22 Was borne [apenechthenai]. First aorist passive infinitive from
   [apopherO], a common compound defective verb. The accusative case of
   general reference [auton] is common with the infinitive in such clauses
   after [egeneto], like indirect discourse. It is his soul, of course,
   that was so borne by the angels, not his body. Into Abraham's bosom
   [eis ton holpon Abraam]. To be in Abraham's bosom is to the Jew to be
   in Paradise. In Joh 1:18 the Logos is in the bosom of the Father.
   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are in heaven and welcome those who come (Mt
   8:11; 4Macc. 14:17). The beloved disciple reclined on the bosom of
   Jesus at the last passover (Joh 13:23) and this fact indicates special
   favour. So the welcome to Lazarus was unusual. Was buried [etaphe].
   Second aorist (effective) passive of the common verb [thaptO].
   Apparently in contrast with the angelic visitation to the beggar.

   16:23 In Hades [en tOi Haidei]. See on Mt 16:18 for discussion of this
   word. Lazarus was in Hades also for both Paradise (Abraham's bosom) and
   Gehenna are in the unseen world beyond the grave. In torments [en
   basanois]. The touchstone by which gold and other metals were tested,
   then the rack for torturing people. Old word, but in the N.T. only
   here, Lu 16:28; Mt 4:24. Sees [horai]. Dramatic present indicative. The
   Jews believed that Gehenna and Paradise were close together. This
   detail in the parable does not demand that we believe it. The picture
   calls for it. From afar [apo makrothen]. Pleonastic use of [apo] as
   [makrothen] means from afar.

   16:24 That he may dip [hina bapsei]. First aorist active subjunctive of
   [baptO], common verb, to dip. In water [hudatos]. Genitive, the
   specifying case, water and not something else. Cool [katapsuxei]. First
   aorist active subjunctive of [katapsuchO], a late Greek compound, to
   cool off, to make cool. Only here in the N.T. but common in medical
   books. Note perfective use of [kata-] (down). A small service that will
   be welcome. For I am in anguish [hoti odunOmai]. The active has a
   causative sense to cause intense pain, the middle to torment oneself
   (Lu 2:48; Ac 20:38), the passive to be translated as here. Common verb,
   but no other examples in the N.T.

   16:25 Receivedst [apelabes]. Second aorist indicative of [apolambanO],
   old verb to get back what is promised and in full. See also Lu 6:34;
   18:30; 23:41. Evil things [ta kaka]. Not "his," but "the evil things"
   that came upon him. Thou art in anguish [odunasai]. Like [kauchasai] in
   Ro 2:17. They contracted [-aesai] without the loss of [s]. Common in
   the Koine.

   16:26 Beside all this [en pasi toutois]. In all these things (or
   regions). Gulf [chasma]. An old word from [chainO], to yawn, our chasm,
   a gaping opening. Only here in the N.T. Is fixed [esteriktai]. Perfect
   passive indicative of [sterizO], old verb (see on Lu 9:51). Permanent
   chasm. May not be able [me dunOntai]. Present middle subjunctive of
   [dunamai]. The chasm is there on purpose (that not, [hopOs me] to
   prevent communication.

   16:27 That you send him [hina pempseis auton]. As if he had not had a
   fair warning and opportunity. The Roman Catholics probably justify
   prayer to saints from this petition from the Rich Man to Abraham, but
   both are in Hades (the other world). It is to be observed besides, that
   Abraham makes no effort to communicate with the five brothers. But
   heavenly recognition is clearly assumed. Dante has a famous description
   of his visit to the damned (Purg.iii, 114).

   16:28 That he may testify [hopOs diamarturetai]. An old verb for solemn
   and thorough [dia-] witness. The Rich Man labours under the delusion
   that his five brothers will believe the testimony of Lazarus as a man
   from the dead.

   16:29 Let them hear them [akousatOsan autOn]. Even the heathen have the
   evidence of nature to show the existence of God as Paul argues in
   Romans so that they are without excuse (Ro 1:20f.).

   16:30 They will repent [metanoesousin]. The Rich Man had failed to do
   this and he now sees that it is the one thing lacking. It is not
   wealth, not poverty, not alms, not influence, but repentance that is
   needed. He had thought repentance was for others, not for all.

   16:31 Neither will they be persuaded [oud' peisthesontai]. First future
   passive of [peithO]. Gressmann calls attention to the fact that Jesus
   is saying this in the conclusion of the parable. It is a sharp
   discouragement against efforts today to communicate with the dead.
   "Saul was not led to repentance when he saw Samuel at Endor nor were
   the Pharisees when they saw Lazarus come forth from the tomb. The
   Pharisees tried to put Lazarus to death and to explain away the
   resurrection of Jesus" (Plummer). Alford comments on the curious fact
   that Lazarus was the name of the one who did rise from the dead but
   whose return from the dead "was the immediate exciting cause of their
   (Pharisees) crowning act of unbelief."
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 17

   17:1 It is impossible [anendekton estin]. See [ouk endechetai] in
   13:33. Alpha privative [an-] and [endektos], verbal adjective, from
   [endechomai]. The word occurs only in late Greek and only here in the
   N.T. The meaning is inadmissible, unallowable. But that occasions of
   stumbling should come [tou ta skandala me elthein]. This genitive
   articular infinitive is not easy to explain. In Ac 10:25 there is
   another example where the genitive articular infinitive seems to be
   used as a nominative (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1040). The loose Hebrew
   infinitive construction may have a bearing here, but one may recall
   that the original infinitives were either locatives [-eni] or datives
   [-ai]. [Ta skandala] is simply the accusative of general reference.
   Literally, the not coming as to occasions of stumbling. For [skandalon]
   (a trap) see on Mt 5:29; 16:23. It is here only in Luke. The positive
   form of this saying appears in Mt 18:7, which see.

   17:2 It were well for him [lusitelei autOi]. An old word, but only here
   in the N.T., from [lusiteles] and this from [luO], to pay, and [ta
   tele], the taxes. So it pays the taxes, it returns expenses, it is
   profitable. Literally here, "It is profitable for him" (dative case,
   [autOi]. Matthew has [sumpherei] (it is advantageous, bears together
   for). If a millstone were hanged [ei lithos mulikos perikeitai].
   Literally, "if a millstone is hanged." Present passive indicative from
   [perikeimai] (to lie or be placed around). It is used as a perfect
   passive of [peritithemi]. So it is a first-class condition, determined
   as fulfilled, not second-class as the English translations imply.
   [Mulikos] is simply a stone [lithos], belonging to a mill. Here only in
   the text of Westcott and Hort, not in Mr 9:42 which is like Mt 18:6
   [mulos onikos] where the upper millstone is turned by an ass, which
   see. Were thrown [erriptai]. Perfect passive indicative from [rhiptO],
   old verb. Literally, is thrown or has been thrown or cast or hurled.
   Mark has [bebletai] and Matthew [katapontisthei], which see, all three
   verbs vivid and expressive. Rather than [e]. The comparative is not
   here expressed before [e] as one would expect. It is implied in
   [lusitelei]. See the same idiom in Lu 15:7.

   17:3 If thy brother sin [ean hamartei]. Second aorist (ingressive)
   subjunctive in condition of third class.

   17:4 Seven times in a day [heptakis tes hemeras]. Seven times within
   the day. On another occasion Peter's question (Mt 18:21) brought
   Christ's answer "seventy times seven" (verse 22), which see. Seven
   times during the day would be hard enough for the same offender.

   17:5 Increase [prosthes]. Second aorist active imperative of
   [prostithemi], to add to. Bruce thinks that this sounds much like the
   stereotyped petition in church prayers. A little reflection will show
   that they should answer the prayer themselves.

   17:6 If ye have [ei echete]. Condition of the first class, assumed to
   be true. Ye would say [elegete an]. Imperfect active with [an] and so a
   conclusion (apodosis) of the second class, determined as unfulfilled, a
   mixed condition therefore. Sycamine tree [sukaminOi]. At the present
   time both the black mulberry (sycamine) and the white mulberry
   (sycamore) exist in Palestine. Luke alone in the N.T. uses either word,
   the sycamine here, the sycamore in 19:4. The distinction is not
   observed in the LXX, but it is observed in the late Greek medical
   writers for both trees have medicinal properties. Hence it may be
   assumed that Luke, as a physician, makes the distinction. Both trees
   differ from the English sycamore. In Mt 17:20 we have "mountain" in
   place of "sycamine tree." Be thou rooted up [ekrizOtheti]. First aorist
   passive imperative as is [phuteutheti]. Would have obeyed [hupekousen
   an]. First aorist active indicative with [an], apodosis of a
   second-class condition (note aorist tense here, imperfect [elegete].

   17:7 Sit down to meat [anapese]. Recline (for the meal). Literally,
   fall up (or back).

   17:8 And will not rather say [all' ouk erei]. But will not say? [Ouk]
   in a question expects the affirmative answer. Gird thyself
   [perizOsamenos]. Direct middle first aorist participle of
   [perizOnnumi], to gird around. Till I have eaten and drunken [heOs
   phagO kai piO]. More exactly, till I eat and drink. The second aorist
   subjunctives are not future perfects in any sense, simply punctiliar
   action, effective aorist. Thou shalt eat and drink [phagesai kai
   piesai]. Future middle indicative second person singular, the
   uncontracted forms [-esai] as often in the Koine.These futures are from
   the aorist stems [ephagon] and [epion] without sigma.

   17:9 Does he thank? [me echei charin;]. [Me] expects the negative
   answer. [EchO charin], to have gratitude toward one, is an old Greek
   idiom (1Ti 1:12; 2Ti 1:3; Heb 12:28).

   17:10 Unprofitable [achreioi]. The Syriac Sinaitic omits
   "unprofitable." The word is common in Greek literature, but in the N.T.
   only here and Mt 25:30 where it means "useless" [a] privative and
   [chreios] from [chraomai], to use). The slave who only does what he is
   commanded by his master to do has gained no merit or credit. "In point
   of fact it is not commands, but demands we have to deal with, arising
   out of special emergencies" (Bruce). The slavish spirit gains no
   promotion in business life or in the kingdom of God.

   17:11 Through the midst of Samaria and Galilee [dia meson Samarias kai
   Galilaias]. This is the only instance in the N.T. of [dia] with the
   accusative in the local sense of "through." Xenophon and Plato use [dia
   mesou] (genitive). Jesus was going from Ephraim (Joh 11:54) north
   through the midst of Samaria and Galilee so as to cross over the Jordan
   near Bethshean and join the Galilean caravan down through Perea to
   Jerusalem. The Samaritans did not object to people going north away
   from Jerusalem, but did not like to see them going south towards the
   city (Lu 9:51-56).

   17:12 Which stood afar off [hoi anestesan porrOthen]. The margin of
   Westcott and Hort reads simply [estesan]. The compound read by B means
   "rose up," but they stood at a distance (Le 13:45f.). The first healing
   of a leper (5:12-16) like this is given by Luke only.

   17:13 Lifted up [eran]. First aorist active of the liquid verb [airO].

   17:14 As they went [en tOi hupagein autous]. Favourite Lukan idiom of
   [en] with articular infinitive as in 17:11 and often.

   17:16 And he was a Samaritan [kai autos en Samareites]. This touch
   colours the whole incident. The one man who felt grateful enough to
   come back and thank Jesus for the blessing was a despised Samaritan.
   The [autos] has point here.

   17:18 Save this stranger [ei me ho allogenes]. The old word was
   [allophulos] (Ac 10:28), but [allogenes] occurs in the LXX, Josephus,
   and inscriptions. Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, p. 80) gives
   the inscription from the limestone block from the Temple of Israel in
   Jerusalem which uses this very word which may have been read by Jesus:
   Let no foreigner enter within the screen and enclosure surrounding the
   sanctuary [Methena allogene eisporeuesthai entos tou peri to hieron
   truphaktou kai peribolou].

   17:20 With observation [meta parateseOs]. Late Greek word from
   [paratereO], to watch closely. Only here in the N.T. Medical writers
   use it of watching the symptoms of disease. It is used also of close
   astronomical observations. But close watching of external phenomena
   will not reveal the signs of the kingdom of God.

   17:21 Within you [entos humOn]. This is the obvious, and, as I think,
   the necessary meaning of [entos]. The examples cited of the use of
   [entos] in Xenophon and Plato where [entos] means "among" do not bear
   that out when investigated. Field (Ot. Norv.) "contends that there is
   no clear instance of [entos] in the sense of among" (Bruce), and
   rightly so. What Jesus says to the Pharisees is that they, as others,
   are to look for the kingdom of God within themselves, not in outward
   displays and supernatural manifestations. It is not a localized display
   "Here" or "There." It is in this sense that in Lu 11:20 Jesus spoke of
   the kingdom of God as "come upon you" [ephthasen eph' humas], speaking
   to Pharisees. The only other instance of [entos] in the N.T. (Mt 23:26)
   necessarily means "within" ("the inside of the cup"). There is, beside,
   the use of [entos] meaning "within" in the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus saying
   of Jesus of the Third Century (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East,
   p. 426) which is interesting: "The kingdom of heaven is within you"
   [entos humOn] as here in Lu 17:21.

   17:23 Go not away nor follow after them [me apelthete mede diOxete].
   Westcott and Hort bracket [apelthete mede]. Note aorist subjunctive
   with [me] in prohibition, ingressive aorist. Do not rush after those
   who set times and places for the second advent. The Messiah was already
   present in the first advent (verse 21) though the Pharisees did not
   know it.

   17:24 Lighteneth [astraptousa]. An old and common verb, though only
   here and 24:4 in the N.T. The second coming will be sudden and
   universally visible. There are still some poor souls who are waiting in
   Jerusalem under the delusion that Jesus will come there and nowhere
   else.

   17:25 But first [prOton de]. The second coming will be only after the
   Cross.

   17:27 They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage
   [esthion, epinon, egamoun, egamizonto]. Imperfects all of them vividly
   picturing the life of the time of Noah. But the other tenses are
   aorists (Noah entered [eiselthen], the flood came [elthen], destroyed
   [apOlesen].

   17:28 Note the same sharp contrast between the imperfects here (ate
   [esthion], drank [epinon], bought [egorazon], sold [epOloun], planted
   [ephuteuon], builded [Oikodomoun] and the aorists in verse 29 (went out
   [exelthen], rained [ebrexen], destroyed {apOlesen].

   17:30 Is revealed [apokaluptetai]. Prophetic and futuristic present
   passive indicative.

   17:31 Let him not go down [me katabatO]. Second aorist active
   imperative of [katabainO] with [me] in a prohibition in the third
   person singular. The usual idiom here would be [me] and the aorist
   subjunctive. See Mr 13:15f.; Mt 24:17f. when these words occur in the
   great eschatological discussion concerning flight before the
   destruction of Jerusalem. Here the application is "absolute
   indifference to all worldly interests as the attitude of readiness for
   the Son of Man" (Plummer).

   17:32 Remember Lot's wife [mnemoneuete tes gunaikos LOt]. Here only in
   the N.T. A pertinent illustration to warn against looking back with
   yearning after what has been left behind (Ge 19:26).

   17:33 Shall preserve it [zOogonesei auten]. Or save it alive. Here only
   in the N.T. except 1Ti 6:13; Ac 7:19. It is a late word and common in
   medical writers, to bring forth alive [zOos, genO] and here to keep
   alive.

   17:34 In that night [tautei tei nukti]. More vivid still, "on this
   night," when Christ comes.

   17:35 Shall be grinding [esontai alethousai]. Periphrastic future
   active indicative of [alethO], an old verb only in the N.T. here and Mt
   24:41. Together [epi to auto]. In the same place, near together as in
   Ac 2:1.

   17:37 The eagles [hoi aetoi]. Or the vultures attracted by the carcass.
   This proverb is quoted also in Mt 24:28. See Job 39:27-30; Heb 1:8; Ho
   8:1. Double compound [epi-sun-] in [epi-sun-achthesontai] completes the
   picture.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 18

   18:1 To the end that [pros to dein]. With a view to the being
   necessary, [pros] and the articular infinitive. The impersonal verb
   [dei] here is in the infinitive and has another infinitive loosely
   connected with it [proseuchesthai], to pray. Not to faint [me
   enkakein]. Literally, not to give in to evil [en, kakeO], from [kakos],
   bad or evil), to turn coward, lose heart, behave badly. A late verb
   used several times in the N.T. (2Co 4:1, 16, etc.).

   18:2 Regarded not [me entrepomenos]. Present middle participle of
   [entrepO], old verb, to turn one on himself, to shame one, to reverence
   one. This was a "hard-boiled" judge who knew no one as his superior.
   See on Mt 21:37.

   18:3 Came oft [ercheto]. Imperfect tense denotes repetitions, no adverb
   for "oft" in the Greek. Avenge me of [ekdikeson me apo]. A late verb
   for doing justice, protecting one from another (note both [ek] and
   [apo], here). Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, pp. 420ff.)
   quotes a [stele] of the second century B.C. with a prayer for vengeance
   for a Jewish girl that had been murdered which has this very verb
   [ekdikeO].

   18:4 He would not [ouk ethelen]. Imperfect tense of continued refusal.
   Though [ei kai]. Concerning sentence, not [kai ei] (even if).

   18:5 Yet [ge]. Delicate intensive particle of deep feeling as here.
   Because this widow troubleth me [dia to parechein moi kopon ten cheran
   tauten]. Literally, because of the furnishing me trouble as to this
   widow (accusative of general reference with the articular infinitive).
   Lest she wear me out [hina me hupOpiazei me]. Some take it that the
   judge is actually afraid that the widow may come and assault him,
   literally beat him under the eye. That idea would be best expressed
   here by the aorist tense.

   18:6 The unrighteous judge [ho krites tes adikias]. The judge of
   unrighteousness (marked by unrighteousness), as in 16:8 we have "the
   steward of unrighteousness," the same idiom.

   18:7 And he is longsuffering [makrothumei]. This present active
   indicative comes in awkwardly after the aorist subjunctive [poiesei]
   after [ou me], but this part of the question is positive. Probably
   [kai] here means "and yet" as so often (Joh 9:30; 16:32, etc.). God
   delays taking vengeance on behalf of his people, not through
   indifference, but through patient forbearance.

   18:8 Howbeit [plen]. It is not clear whether this sentence is also a
   question or a positive statement. There is no way to decide. Either
   will make sense though not quite the same sense. The use of [ara]
   before [heuresei] seems to indicate a question expecting a negative
   answer as in Ac 8:30; Ro 14:19. But here [ara] comes in the middle of
   the sentence instead of near the beginning, an unusual position for
   either inferential [ara] or interrogative [ara]. On the whole the
   interrogative [ara] is probably correct, meaning to question if the Son
   will find a persistence of faith like that of the widow.

   18:9 Set all others at naught [exouthenountas tous loipous]. A late
   verb [exoutheneO], like [oudeneO], from [outhen] [ouden], to consider
   or treat as nothing. In LXX and chiefly in Luke and Paul in the N.T.

   18:10 Stood [statheis]. First aorist passive participle of [histemi].
   Struck an attitude ostentatiously where he could be seen. Standing was
   the common Jewish posture in prayer (Mt 6:5; Mr 11:25). Prayed thus
   [tauta proseucheto]. Imperfect middle, was praying these things (given
   following). With himself [pros heauton]. A soliloquy with his own soul,
   a complacent recital of his own virtues for his own self-satisfaction,
   not fellowship with God, though he addresses God. I thank thee
   [eucharistO soi]. But his gratitude to God is for his own virtues, not
   for God's mercies to him. One of the rabbis offers a prayer like this
   of gratitude that he was in a class by himself because he was a Jew and
   not a Gentile, because he was a Pharisee and not of the am-haaretz or
   common people, because he was a man and not a woman. Extortioners
   [harpages]. An old word, [harpax] from same root as [harpazO], to
   plunder. An adjective of only one gender, used of robbers and
   plunderers, grafters, like the publicans (Lu 3:13), whether wolves (Mt
   7:15) or men (1Co 5:19f.). The Pharisee cites the crimes of which he is
   not guilty. Or even [e kai]. As the climax of iniquity (Bruce), he
   points to "this publican." Zaccheus will admit robbery (Lu 19:8). God
   [ho theos]. Nominative form with the article as common with the
   vocative use of [theos] (so verse 13; Joh 20:28).

   18:12 Twice in the week [dis tou sabbatou]. One fast a year was
   required by the law (Le 16:29; Nu 29:7). The Pharisees added others,
   twice a week between passover and pentecost, and between tabernacles
   and dedication of the temple. I get [ktOmai]. Present middle
   indicative, not perfect middle [kektemai] (I possess). He gave a tithe
   of his income, not of his property.

   18:13 Standing afar off [makrothen hestOs]. Second perfect active
   participle of [histemi], intransitive like [statheis] above. But no
   ostentation as with the Pharisee in verse 11. At a distance from the
   Pharisee, not from the sanctuary. Would not lift [ouk ethelen oude
   eparai]. Negatives (double) imperfect of thelO, was not willing even to
   lift up, refused to lift [eparai], first aorist active infinitive of
   the liquid compound verb, [ep-airO]. Smote [etupte]. Imperfect active
   of [tuptO], old verb, kept on smiting or beating. Worshippers usually
   lifted up their closed eyes to God. Be merciful [hilastheti]. First
   aorist passive imperative of [hilaskomai], an old verb, found also in
   LXX and inscriptions [exhilaskomai], Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 224).
   A sinner [tOi hamartOlOi]. The sinner, not a sinner. It is curious how
   modern scholars ignore this Greek article. The main point in the
   contrast lies in this article. The Pharisee thought of others as
   sinners. The publican thinks of himself alone as the sinner, not of
   others at all.

   18:14 This man [houtos]. This despised publican referred to
   contemptuously in verse 11 as "this" [houtos] publican. Rather than the
   other [par' ekeinon]. In comparison with (placed beside) that one. A
   neat Greek idiom after the perfect passive participle [dedikaiomenos].
   For [hoti]. This moral maxim Christ had already used in 14:11. Plummer
   pertinently asks: "Why is it assumed that Jesus did not repeat his
   sayings?"

   18:15 They brought [prosepheron]. Imperfect active, they were bringing.
   So Mr 10:13. Their babes [ta brephe]. Old word for infants. Here Mr
   10:13; Mt 19:13 have [paidia] (little children). Note "also" [kai] in
   Luke, not in Mark and Matthew. That he should touch them [hina autOn
   haptetai]. Present middle subjunctive (linear action, repeatedly touch
   or one after the other), where Mr 10:13 has aorist middle subjunctive
   [hapsetai]. Rebuked [epetimOn]. Imperfect indicative active. Either
   inchoative began to rebuke, or continued, kept on rebuking. Matthew and
   Mark have the aorist [epetimesan].

   18:16 Called [prosekalesato]. Indirect middle aorist indicative, called
   the children with their parents to himself and then rebuked the
   disciples for their rebuke of the parents. The language of Jesus is
   precisely that of Mr 10:14 which see, and nearly that of Mt 19:14 which
   see also. The plea of Jesus that children be allowed to come to him is
   one that many parents need to heed. It is a tragedy to think of parents
   "forbidding" their children or of preachers doing the same or of both
   being stumbling-blocks to children.

   18:17 As a little child [hOs paidion]. Jesus makes the child the model
   for those who seek entrance into the kingdom of God, not the adult the
   model for the child. He does not say that the child is already in the
   kingdom without coming to him. Jesus has made the child's world by
   understanding the child and opening the door for him.

   18:18 Ruler [archOn]. Not in Mr 10:17; Mt 19:16. What shall I do to
   inherit? [Ti poiesas kleronomesO;]. "By doing what shall I inherit?"
   Aorist active participle and future active indicative. Precisely the
   same question is asked by the lawyer in Lu 10:25. This young man
   probably thought that by some one act he could obtain eternal life. He
   was ready to make a large expenditure for it. Good [agathon]. See on Mr
   10:17; Mt 19:16 for discussion of this adjective for absolute goodness.
   Plummer observes that no Jewish rabbi was called "good" in direct
   address. The question of Jesus will show whether it was merely fulsome
   flattery on the part of the young man or whether he really put Jesus on
   a par with God. He must at any rate define his attitude towards Christ.

   18:22 One thing thou lackest yet [eti hen soi leipei]. Literally, one
   thing still fails thee or is wanting to thee. An old verb with the
   dative of personal interest. Mr 10:21 has here [husterei se], which
   see. It was an amazing compliment for one who was aiming at perfection
   (Mt 19:21). The youth evidently had great charm and was sincere in his
   claims. Distribute [diados]. Second aorist active imperative of
   [diadidOmi] (give to various ones, [dia-]. Here Mark and Matthew simply
   have [dos] (give). The rest the same in all three Gospels.

   18:23 Became [egenethe]. First aorist passive indicative of [ginomai].
   Like his countenance fell [stugnasas], in Mr 10:22. Exceedingly
   sorrowful [perilupos]. Old adjective [peri, lupe] with perfective use
   of [peri]. Very rich [plousios sphodra]. Rich exceedingly. Today, a
   multimillionaire.

   18:24 Shall they enter [eisporeuontai]. Present middle indicative,
   futuristic present.

   18:25 Through a needle's eye [dia trematos belones]. Both words are
   old. [Trema] means a perforation or hole or eye and in the N.T. only
   here and Mt 19:24. [Belone] means originally the point of a spear and
   then a surgeon's needle. Here only in the N.T. Mr 10:25; Mt 19:24 have
   [rhaphidos] for needle. This is probably a current proverb for the
   impossible. The Talmud twice speaks of an elephant passing through the
   eye of a needle as being impossible.

   18:26 Then who [kai tis]. Literally, and who. The [kai] calls attention
   to what has just been said. Wealth was assumed to be mark of divine
   favour, not a hindrance to salvation.

   18:27 The impossible with men possible with God [ta adunata para
   anthrOpois dunata para tOi theOi]. Paradoxical, but true. Take your
   stand "beside" [para] God and the impossible becomes possible. Clearly
   then Jesus meant the humanly impossible by the parabolic proverb about
   the camel going through the needle's eye. God can break the grip of
   gold on a man's life, but even Jesus failed with this young ruler.

   18:28 Our own [ta idia]. Our own things (home, business, etc.). Right
   here is where so many fail. Peter speaks here not in a spirit of
   boastfulness, but rather with his reactions from their consternation at
   what has happened and at the words of Jesus (Plummer).

   18:30 Shall not receive [ouchi me labei]. Very strong double negative
   with aorist active subjunctive of [lambanO]. Manifold more
   [pollaplasiona]. Late Greek word, here alone in the N.T. save Mt 19:29
   where Westcott and Hort have it though many MSS. there read
   [hekatonplasiona] (a hundredfold) as in Mr 10:30).

   18:31 Took unto him [paralabOn]. Second aorist active participle of
   [paralambanO]. Taking along with himself. So Mr 10:32. Mt 20:17 adds
   [kat' idian] (apart). Jesus is making a special point of explaining his
   death to the Twelve. We go up [anabainomen]. Present active indicative,
   we are going up. Unto the Son of man [tOi huiOi tou anthrOpou]. Dative
   case of personal interest. The position is amphibolous and the
   construction makes sense either with "shall be accomplished"
   [telesthesetai] or "that are written" [ta gegrammena], probably the
   former. Compare these minute details of the prophecy here (verses 32f.)
   with the words in Mr 10:33f.; Mt 20:18f., which see.

   18:33 The third day [tei hemerai tei tritei]. The day the third. In Mt
   20:19 it is "the third day" while in Mr 10:34 "after three days" occurs
   in the same sense, which see.

   18:34 And they perceived not [kai ouk eginOskon]. Imperfect active.
   They kept on not perceiving. Twice already Luke has said this in the
   same sentence. They understood none of these things [ouden toutOn
   sunekan]. First aorist active indicative, a summary statement. This
   saying was hid from them [en to rhema touto kekrummenon ap' autOn].
   Past perfect passive indicative (periphrastic), state of completion. It
   was a puzzling experience. No wonder that Luke tries three times to
   explain the continued failure of the apostles to understand Jesus. The
   words of Christ about his death ran counter to all their hopes and
   beliefs.

   18:35 Unto Jericho [eis IereichO]. See on Mt 20:29; Mr 10:46, for
   discussion of the two Jerichos in Mark and Matt. (the old and the new
   as here). Begging [epaitOn]. Asking for something. He probably was by
   the wayside between the old Jericho and the new Roman Jericho. Mark
   gives his name Bartimaeus (10:46). Mt 20:30 mentions two.

   18:36 Inquired [epunthaneto]. Imperfect middle. Repeatedly inquired as
   he heard the tramp of the passing crowd going by [diaporeuomenou]. What
   this meant [Ti eie touto]. Literally, What it was. Without [an] the
   optative is due to indirect discourse, changed from [estin]. With [an]
   (margin of Westcott and Hort) the potential optative of the direct
   discourse is simply retained.

   18:37 Passeth by [parerchetai]. Present middle indicative retained in
   indirect discourse as [paragei] is in Mt 20:30). No reason for
   differences of English tenses in the two passages (was passing by,
   passeth by).

   18:38 He cried [eboesen]. Old verb, [boaO], to shout, as in 9:38. Son
   of David [huie Daueid]. Shows that he recognizes Jesus as the Messiah.

   18:39 That he should hold his peace [hina sigesei]. Ingressive aorist
   subjunctive. That he should become silent; as with [hina siOpesei] in
   Mr 10:48. The more a great deal [pollOi mallon]. By much more as in Mr
   10:48.

   18:40 Stood [statheis]. First aorist passive where Mr 10:49; Mt 20:32
   have [stas] (second aorist active) translated "stood still." One is as
   "still" as the other. The first is that Jesus " stopped." Be brought
   [achthenai]. First aorist infinitive in indirect command.

   18:41 What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? [Ti soi theleis
   poiesO;]. Same idiom in Mr 10:51; Mt 20:32 which see, the use of
   [thelO] without [hina] with aorist subjunctive (or future indicative).
   See same references also for [hina anablepsO] "that I may see again"
   without verb before [hina]. Three uses of [anablepO] here (verses 41,
   42, 43).

   18:43 Followed [ekolouthei]. Imperfect active as in Mr 10:52. Either
   inchoative he began to follow, or descriptive, he was following.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 19

   19:1 Was passing through [diercheto]. Imperfect middle. Now Jesus was
   inside the Roman Jericho with the procession.

   19:2 Chief publican [architelOnes]. The word occurs nowhere else
   apparently but the meaning is clear from the other words with [archi-]
   like [archiereus] (chief priest) [archipoimen] (chief shepherd).
   Jericho was an important trading point for balsam and other things and
   so Zacchaeus was the head of the tax collections in this region, a sort
   of commissioner of taxes who probably had other publicans serving under
   him.

   19:3 He sought [ezetei]. Imperfect active. He was seeking, conative
   idea. Jesus who he was [Iesoun tis estin]. Prolepsis, to see who Jesus
   was. He had heard so much about him. He wanted to see which one of the
   crowd was Jesus. For the crowd [apo tou ochlou]. He was short and the
   crowd was thick and close. Stature [tei helikiai]. No doubt of that
   meaning here and possibly so in 2:52. Elsewhere "age" except Lu 12:25;
   Mt 6:27 where it is probably "stature" also.

   19:4 Ran on before [prodramOn eis to emprosthen]. Second aorist active
   participle of [protrechO] (defective verb). "Before" occurs twice
   [pro-] and [eis to emprosthen]. Into a sycamore tree [epi sukomorean].
   From [sukon], fig, and [moron], mulberry. The fig-mulberry and quite a
   different tree from the sycamine tree in 17:6, which see. It bore a
   poor fruit which poor people ate (Am 7:14). It was a wide open tree
   with low branches so that Zacchaeus could easily climb into it. That
   way [ekeines]. Feminine for [hodos] (way) is understood. Genitive case
   with [di] in composition [dierchesthai] or as an adverbial use.

   19:5 Make haste and come down [speusas katabethi]. Simultaneous aorist
   active participle [speusas] with the second aorist active imperative.
   "Come down in a hurry."

   19:6 He made haste and came down [speusas katebe]. Luke repeats the
   very words of Jesus with the same idiom. Received him joyfully
   [hupedexato auton chairOn]. The very verb used of Martha's welcome to
   Jesus (10:38). "Joyfully" is the present active participle, "rejoicing"
   [chairOn].

   19:7 Murmured [diegogguzonto]. Imperfect middle of this compound
   onomatopoetic word [dia-gogguzO]. In Lu 5:30 we have the simple
   [gogguzO], a late word like the cooing doves or the hum of bees. This
   compound with [dia-] is still rarer, but more expressive. To lodge
   [katalusai]. Jesus was the hero of this crowd from Galilee on their way
   to the passover. But here he had shocked their sensibilities and those
   of the people of Jericho by inviting himself to be the guest of this
   chief publican and notorious sinner who had robbed nearly everybody in
   the city by exorbitant taxes.

   19:8 Stood [statheis]. Apparently Jesus and Zacchaeus had come to the
   house of Zacchaeus and were about to enter when the murmur became such
   a roar that Zacchaeus turned round and faced the crowd. If I have
   wrongfully exacted aught of any man [ei tinos ti esukophantesa]. A most
   significant admission and confession. It is a condition of the first
   class [ei] and the aorist active indicative) that assumes it to be
   true. His own conscience was at work. He may have heard audible murmurs
   from the crowd. For the verb [sukophantein], see discussion on 3:14,
   the only two instances in the N.T. He had extorted money wrongfully as
   they all knew. I return fourfold [apodidOmi tetraploun]. I offer to do
   it here and now on this spot. This was the Mosaic law (Ex 22:1; Nu
   5:6f.). Restitution is good proof of a change of heart. D. L. Moody
   used to preach it with great power. Without this the offer of Zacchaeus
   to give half his goods to the poor would be less effective. "It is an
   odd coincidence, nothing more, that the fig-mulberry (sycamore) should
   occur in connexion with the fig-shewer (sycophant)."

   19:10 The lost [to apolOlos]. The neuter as a collective whole, second
   perfect active participle of [apollumi], to destroy. See Lu 15 for the
   idea of the lost.

   19:11 He added and spake [prostheis eipen]. Second aorist active
   participle of [prostithemi] with [eipen]. It is a Hebrew idiom seen
   also in Lu 20:1f. he added to send [prosetheto pempsai] and in Ac 12:3
   "he added to seize" [prosetheto sullabein]. This undoubted Hebraism
   occurs in the N.T. in Luke only, probably due to the influence of the
   LXX on Luke the Greek Christian. To appear [anaphainesthai]. Present
   passive infinitive of an old verb to be made manifest, to be shown up.
   In the N.T. only here and Ac 21:3.

   19:12 To take to himself a kingdom [labein heautOi basileian]. Second
   aorist active infinitive of [lambanO] with the dative reflexive
   [heautOi] where the middle voice could have been used. Apparently this
   parable has the historical basis of Archelaus who actually went from
   Jerusalem to Rome on this very errand to get a kingdom in Palestine and
   to come back to it. This happened while Jesus was a boy in Nazareth and
   it was a matter of common knowledge.

   19:13 Trade ye herewith till I come [pragmateusasthe en hOi erchomai].
   First aorist middle imperative of [pragmateuomai], an old verb from
   [pragma], business. Here only in the N.T. Westcott and Hort in their
   text read [pragmateusasthai], first aorist middle infinitive [-ai] and
   [-e] were pronounced alike). The infinitive makes it indirect
   discourse, the imperative direct. While I am coming is what [en hOi
   erchomai] really means.

   19:14 His citizens [hoi politai autou]. That actually happened with
   Archelaus.

   19:15 When he was come back again [en tOi epanelthein auton]. "On the
   coming back again as to him." Luke's favourite idiom of the articular
   infinitive after [en] and with the accusative of general reference. Had
   given [dedOkei]. Past perfect active indicative without augment of
   [didOmi]. That he might know [hina gnoi]. Second aorist active
   subjunctive of [ginoskO]. The optative would be [gnoie].

   19:16 Hath made [prosergasato]. Only here in the N.T. Note [pros-] in
   addition, besides, more.

   19:17 Have thou authority [isthi exousian echOn]. Periphrastic present
   active imperative. Keep on having authority.

   19:19 Be thou also over [kai su epano ginou]. Present middle
   imperative. Keep on becoming over. There is no real reason for
   identifying this parable of the pounds with the parable of the talents
   in Mt 25. The versatility of Jesus needs to be remembered by those who
   seek to flatten out everything.

   19:20 I kept [eichon]. Imperfect active of [echO]. I kept on keeping.
   Laid up [apokeimenen]. Present passive participle agreeing with [hen]
   (which), used often as perfect passive of [tithemi] as here, laid away
   or off [apo]. It is not the periphrastic construction, but two separate
   verbs, each with its own force. In a napkin [en soudariOi]. A Latin
   word sudarium from sudor (sweat) transliterated into Greek, a
   sweatcloth handkerchief or napkin. Found in papyrus marriage contracts
   as part of the dowry (second and third centuries A.D., Deissmann, Bible
   Studies, p. 223). Used also for swathing the head of the dead (Joh
   11:44; 20:7).

   19:21 I feared [ephoboumen]. Imperfect middle, I continued to fear.
   Austere [austeros]. Old Greek word from [auO], to dry up. Reproduced in
   Latin austeros and English austere.It means rough to the taste,
   stringent. Here only in the N.T. Compare [skleros] (hard) in Mt 25:24.
   "Harsh in flavour, then in disposition" (Bruce). Thou layedst not down
   [ouk ethekas]. Probably a proverb for a grasping profiteer.

   19:22 Thou knewest [eideis]. Second past perfect of [horaO], to see,
   used as imperfect of [oida], to know. Either it must be taken as a
   question as Westcott and Hort do or be understood as sarcasm as the
   Revised Version has it. The words of the wicked [poneros] slave are
   turned to his own condemnation.

   19:23 Then wherefore [kai dia ti]. Note this inferential use of [kai-]
   in that case. Into the bank [epi trapezan]. Literally, upon a table.
   This old word [trapeza], from [tetrapeza] [tetra], four, [pous], foot).
   It means then any table (Mr 7:28), food on the table (Ac 16:34), feast
   or banquet (Ro 11:9), table of the money-changers (Joh 2:15; Mr 11:15;
   Mt 21:12), or bank as here. Our word bank is from Old English
   bench.With interest [sun tokOi]. Not usury, but proper and legal
   interest. Old word from [tiktO], to bring forth. In the N.T. only here
   and Mt 25:27. Should have required it [an auto epraxa]. Conclusion of
   second-class condition the condition or apodosis being implied in the
   participle "coming" [elthOn], and the previous question. On this
   technical use of [prassO] [epraxa] see Lu 3:13.

   19:25 And they said unto him [kai eipan autOi]. Probably the eager
   audience who had been listening to this wonderful parable interrupted
   Jesus at this point because of this sudden turn when the one pound is
   given to the man who has ten pounds. If so, it shows plainly how keenly
   they followed the story which Jesus was giving because of their
   excitement about the kingdom (Lu 19:11).

   19:26 That hath not [tou me echontos]. The present tense of [echO]
   here, that keeps on not having, probably approaches the idea of
   acquiring or getting, the one who keeps on not acquiring. This is the
   law of nature and of grace.

   19:27 Reign [basileusai]. First aorist active infinitive, ingressive
   aorist, come to rule. Slay [katasphaxate]. First aorist active
   imperative of [katasphazO], to slaughter, an old verb, but only here in
   the N.T.

   19:28 Went on before [eporeueto emprosthen]. Imperfect middle. Jesus
   left the parable to do its work and slowly went on his way up the hill
   to Jerusalem.

   19:29 Unto Bethphage and Bethany [eis Bethphage kai Bethania]. Both
   indeclinable forms of the Hebrew or Aramaic names. In Mr 11:1 "Bethany"
   is inflected regularly, which see. Of Olives [ElaiOn]. As in Mr 11:1;
   Mt 21:1, though some editors take it to be, not the genitive plural of
   [elaia] (olive tree), but the name of the place Olivet. In the Greek it
   is just a matter of accent (circumflex or acute) Olivet is correct in
   Ac 1:12. See on Mt 21:1ff.; Mr 11:1ff. for details.

   19:30 Whereon no man ever yet sat [eph' hon oudeis pOpote anthrOpOn
   ekathisen]. Plummer holds that this fact indicated to the disciples a
   royal progress into the city of a piece with the Virgin Birth of Jesus
   and the burial in a new tomb.

   19:32 As he had said unto them [kathOs eipen autois]. Luke alone notes
   this item.

   19:33 As they were loosing [luontOn autOn]. Genitive absolute. The
   owners thereof [hoi kurioi autou]. The same word [kurios] used of the
   Lord Jesus in verse 31 (and 34) and which these "owners" would
   understand. See on Mt 21:3; Mr 11:3 for [kurios] used by Jesus about
   himself with the expectation that these disciples would recognize him
   by that title as they did. The word in common use for the Roman emperor
   and in the LXX to translate the Hebrew Elohim (God).

   19:35 Set Jesus thereon [epebibasan ton Iesoun]. First aorist active.
   Old verb, to cause to mount, causative verb from [bainO], to go. In the
   N.T. only here and Lu 10:34; Ac 23:24.

   19:36 They spread [hupestrOnnuon]. Imperfect active describing the
   continued spreading as they went on. [HupostrOnnuO] is a late form of
   the old verb [hupostorennumi]. Here only in the N.T.

   19:37 At the descent [pros tei katabasei]. Epexegetic of "drawing
   nigh." They were going by the southern slope of the Mount of Olives. As
   they turned down to the city, the grand view stirred the crowd to
   rapturous enthusiasm. This was the first sight of the city on this
   route which is soon obscured in the descent. The second view bursts out
   again (verse 41). It was a shout of triumph from the multitude with
   their long pent-up enthusiasm (verse 11), restrained no longer by the
   parable of the pounds. For all the mighty works which they had seen
   [peri pasOn eidon dunameOn]. Neat Greek idiom, incorporation of the
   antecedent [dunameOn] into the relative clause and attraction of the
   case of the relative from the accusative [has] to the genitive [hOn].
   And note "all." The climax had come, Lazarus, Bartimaeus, and the rest.

   19:38 The king cometh [ho erchomenos, ho basileus]. The Messianic hopes
   of the people were now all ablaze with expectation of immediate
   realization. A year ago in Galilee he had frustrated their plans for a
   revolutionary movement "to take him by force to make him king" (Joh
   6:15). The phrase "the coming king" like "the coming prophet" (Joh
   6:14; De 18:15) expressed the hope of the long-looked-for Messiah. They
   are singing from the Hallel in their joy that Jesus at last is making
   public proclamation of his Messiahship. Peace in heaven, and glory in
   the highest [en ouranOi eirene kai doxa en hupsistois]. This language
   reminds one strongly of the song of the angels at the birth of Jesus
   (Lu 2:14). Mr 11:10; Mt 21:9 have "Hosannah in the highest."

   19:39 Some of the Pharisees [tines tOn PharisaiOn]. Luke seems to imply
   by "from the multitude" [apo tou ochlou] that these Pharisees were in
   the procession, perhaps half-hearted followers of the mob. But Joh
   12:19 speaks of Pharisees who stood off from the procession and blamed
   each other for their failure and the triumph of Jesus. These may
   represent the bolder spirits of their same group who dared to demand of
   Jesus that he rebuke his disciples.

   19:40 If these shall hold their peace [ean houtoi siOpesousin]. A
   condition of the first class, determined as fulfilled. The use of [ean]
   rather than [ei] cuts no figure in the case (see Ac 8:31; 1Th 3:8; 1Jo
   5:15). The kind of condition is determined by the mode which is here
   indicative. The future tense by its very nature does approximate the
   aorist subjunctive, but after all it is the indicative. The stones will
   cry out [hoi lithoi kraxousin]. A proverb for the impossible happening.

   19:41 Wept [eklausen]. Ingressive aorist active indicative, burst into
   tears. Probably audible weeping.

   19:42 If thou hadst known [ei egnOs]. Second aorist active indicative
   of [ginOskO]. Second-class condition, determined as unfulfilled. Even
   thou [kai su]. Emphatic position of the subject. But now [nun de].
   Aposiopesis. The conclusion is not expressed and the sudden breaking
   off and change of structure is most impressive. They are hid [ekrube].
   Second aorist passive indicative of [kruptO], common verb, to hide.

   19:43 Shall cast up a bank [parembalousin charaka]. Future active
   indicative of [paremballO], a double compound [para, en, ballO] of long
   usage, finally in a military sense of line of battle or in camp. Here
   alone in the N.T. So also the word [charaka] [charax] for bank, stake,
   palisade, rampart, is here alone in the N.T., though common enough in
   the old Greek. Compass thee round [perikuklOsousin se]. Future active
   indicative. Another common compound to make a circle [kuklos] around
   [peri], though here only in the N.T. Keep thee in [sunexousin se].
   Shall hold thee together on every side [pantothen]. See about [sunechO]
   on 4:38.

   19:44 Shall dash to the ground [edaphiousin]. Attic future of
   [edaphizO], to beat level, to raze to the ground, a rare verb from
   [edaphos], bottom, base, ground (Ac 22:7), here alone in the N.T.
   Because [anth' hOn]. "In return for which things." Thou knewest not
   [ouk egnOs]. Applying the very words of the lament in the condition in
   verse 42. This vivid prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem is used
   by those who deny predictive prophecy even for Jesus as proof that Luke
   wrote the Gospel after the destruction of Jerusalem. But it is no proof
   at all to those who concede to Jesus adequate knowledge of his mission
   and claims.

   19:45 Began to cast out [erxato ekballein]. So Mr 11:15 whereas Mt
   21:12 has simply "he cast out." See Mark and Matthew for discussion of
   this second cleansing of the temple at the close of the public ministry
   in relation to the one at the beginning in Joh 2:14-22. There is
   nothing gained by accusing John or the Synoptics of a gross
   chronological blunder. There was abundant time in these three years for
   all the abuses to be revived.

   19:47 He was teaching [en didaskOn]. Periphrastic imperfect. Daily [to
   kath' hemeran]. Note the accusative neuter article, "as to the
   according to the day," very awkward English surely, but perfectly good
   Greek. The same idiom occurs in 11:3. Sought [ezetoun]. Imperfect
   active, conative imperfect, were seeking, trying to seek. The principal
   men of the people [hoi prOtoi tou laou]. The first men of the people.
   The position after the verb and apart from the chief priests and the
   scribes calls special attention to them. Some of these "first men" were
   chief priests or scribes, but not all of them. The lights and leaders
   of Jerusalem were bent on the destruction [apolesai] of Jesus. The
   raising of Lazarus from the dead brought them together for this action
   (Joh 11:47-53; 12:9-11.

   19:48 They could not find [ouch heuriskon]. Imperfect active. They kept
   on not finding. What they might do [to ti poiesOsin]. First aorist
   active deliberative subjunctive in a direct question retained in the
   indirect. Note the article [to] (neuter accusative) with the question.
   Hung upon him [exekremeto autou]. Imperfect middle of [ekkremamai], an
   old verb [mi] form) to hang from, here only in the N.T. The form is an
   [omega] form from [ekkremomai], a constant tendency to the [omega] form
   in the Koine.It pictures the whole nation (save the leaders in verse
   47) hanging upon the words of Jesus as if in suspense in mid-air, rapt
   attention that angered these same leaders. Tyndale renders it "stuck by
   him."
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 20

   20:1 On one of the days [en miai tOn hemerOn]. Luke's favourite way of
   indicating time. It was the last day of the temple teaching (Tuesday).
   Lu 20:1-19 is to be compared with Mr 11:27-12:12; Mt 21:23-46. There
   came upon him [epestesan]. Second aorist active indicative, ingressive
   aorist of [ephistemi], old and common verb, stood up against him, with
   the notion of sudden appearance. These leaders (cf. 19:47) had
   determined to attack Jesus on this morning, both Sadducees (chief
   priests) and Pharisees (scribes), a formal delegation from the
   Sanhedrin.

   20:2 Tell us [eipon hemin]. Luke adds these words to what Mark and
   Matthew have. Second aorist active imperative for the old form [eipe]
   and with ending [-on] of the first aorist active. Westcott and Hort
   punctuate the rest of the sentence as an indirect question after
   [eipon], but the Revised Version puts a semicolon after "us" and
   retains the direct question. The Greek manuscripts have no punctuation.

   20:3 Question [logon]. Literally, word. So in Mr 11:29; Mt 21:24.

   20:5 They reasoned with themselves [sunelogisanto]. First aorist middle
   of [sullogizomai], to bring together accounts, an old word, only here
   in the N.T. Mark and Matthew have [dielogizonto] (imperfect middle of
   [dialogizomai], a kindred verb, to reckon between one another, confer).
   This form [dielogizonto] in verse 14 below. If we shall say [ean
   eipOmen]. Third-class condition with second aorist active subjunctive.
   Suppose we say! So in verse 6.

   20:6 Will stone us [katalithasei]. Late verb and here only in the N.T.
   Literally, will throw stones down on us, stone us down, overwhelm us
   with stones. They be persuaded [pepeismenos estin]. Periphrastic
   perfect passive indicative of [peithO], to persuade, a settled state of
   persuasion, "is persuaded" (no reason for use of "be" here). That John
   was a prophet [IOanen propheten einai]. Accusative and infinitive in
   indirect assertion.

   20:7 That they knew not [me eidenai]. Accusative and infinitive in
   indirect assertion again with the negative [me] rather than [ou].

   20:9 Vineyard [ampelOna]. Late word from [ampelos] (vine), place of
   vines. So in Mr 12:1; Mt 21:33. Let it out [exedeto]. Second aorist
   middle of [ekdidOmi], but with variable vowel [e] in place of [o] of
   the stem [do] [exedoto]. Same form in Mark and Matthew. For a long time
   [chronous hikanous]. Accusative of extent of time, considerable times
   or periods of time. Not in Mark and Matthew, though all three have
   [apedemesen] (went off from home). See on Lu 7:6 for [hikanos].

   20:10 At the season [kairOi]. The definite season for the fruit like
   [ho kairos tOn karpOn] (Mt 21:34). That they should give [hina
   dOsousin]. Future indicative with [hina] for purpose like the aorist
   subjunctive, though not so frequent.

   20:11 He sent yet another [prosetheto heteron pempsai]. Literally, he
   added to send another. A clear Hebraism repeated in verse 12 and also
   in 19:11.

   20:12 They wounded [traumatisantes]. First aorist active participle of
   [traumatizO]. An old verb, from [trauma], a wound, but in the N.T. only
   here and Ac 19:16.

   20:13 What shall I do? [Ti poiesO;]. Deliberative future indicative or
   aorist subjunctive (same form). This detail only in Luke. Note the
   variations in all three Gospels. All three have "will reverence"
   [entrapesontai] for which see Matthew and Mark. It may be [isOs].
   Perhaps, from [isos], equal. Old adverb, but only here in the N.T.

   20:14 That the inheritance may be ours [hina hemOn genetai he
   kleronomia]. That the inheritance may become [genetai], second aorist
   middle subjunctive of [ginomai]. Here Mt 21:39 has [schOmen] "let us
   get, ingressive aorist active subjunctive." Cf. [echOmen], present
   subjunctive of the same verb [echO] in Ro 5:1; Mr 12:7 has "and it will
   be ours" [estai].

   20:16 God forbid [me genoito]. Optative of wish about the future with
   [me]. Literally, may it not happen. No word "God" in the Greek. This
   was the pious protest of the defeated members of the Sanhedrin who
   began to see the turn of the parable against themselves.

   20:17 He looked upon them [emblepsas autois]. Not in Mark and Matthew.
   First aorist active participle of [emblepO], to look on. It was a
   piercing glance. The scripture quoted is from Ps 118:22 and is in Mr
   11:10; Mt 21:42, which see for the inverted attraction of the case
   [lithon] (stone) to that of the relative [hon] (which).

   20:18 Shall be broken to pieces [sunthlasthesetai]. Future passive
   indicative of [sunthlaO], a rather late compound, only here in the N.T.
   unless Mt 21:44 is genuine. It means to shatter. Will scatter him as
   dust [likmesei]. From [likmaO], an old verb to winnow and then to grind
   to powder. Only here in the N.T. unless in Mt 21:44 is genuine, which
   see.

   20:19 To lay hands on him [epibalein ep' auton tas cheiras]. Second
   aorist active infinitive of [epiballO], an old verb and either
   transitively as here or intransitively as in Mr 4:37. Vivid picture
   here where Mr 12:12; Mt 21:46 has "to seize" [kratesai]. In that very
   hour [en autei tei hOrai]. Luke's favourite idiom, in the hour itself.
   Not in Mark or Matthew and shows that the Sanhedrin were angry enough
   to force the climax then. And they feared [kai ephobethesan].
   Adversative use of [kai] = but they feared. Hence they refrained. For
   they perceived [egnOsan gar]. The reason for their rage. Second aorist
   active indicative of [ginOskO]. Against them [pros autous]. As in Mr
   12:12. The cap fitted them and they saw it.

   20:20 They watched him [parateresantes]. First aorist active participle
   of [paratereO], a common Greek verb to watch on the side or insidiously
   or with evil intent as in Lu 6:7 [pareterounto] of the scribes and
   Pharisees. See on Mr 3:2. There is no "him" in the Greek. They were
   watching their chance. Spies [enkathetous]. An old verbal adjective
   from [enkathiemi], to send down in or secretly. It means liers in wait
   who are suborned to spy out, one who is hired to trap one by crafty
   words. Only here in the N.T. Feigned themselves [hupokrinomenous
   heautous]. Hypocritically professing to be "righteous" [dikaious].
   "They posed as scrupulous persons with a difficulty of conscience"
   (Plummer). That they might take hold of his speech [hina epilabOntai
   autou logou]. Second aorist middle of [epilambanO], an old verb for
   seizing hold with the hands and uses as here the genitive case. These
   spies are for the purpose of [hina] catching hold of the talk of Jesus
   if they can get a grip anywhere. This is their direct purpose and the
   ultimate purpose or result is also stated, "so as to deliver him up"
   [hOste paradounai auton]. Second aorist active infinitive of
   [paradidOmi], to hand over, to give from one's side to another. The
   trap is all set now and ready to be sprung by these "spies." Of the
   governor [tou hegemonos]. The Sanhedrin knew that Pilate would have to
   condemn Jesus if he were put to death. So then all their plans focus on
   this point as the goal. Luke alone mentions this item here.

   20:21 Rightly [orthOs]. Matthew (Mt 22:16) notes that these "spies"
   were "disciples" (students) of the Pharisees and Mark (Mr 12:13) adds
   that the Herodians are also involved in the plot. These bright
   theologues are full of palaver and flattery and openly endorse the
   teaching of Jesus as part of their scheme. Acceptest not the person of
   any [ou lambaneis prosOpon]. Dost not take the face (or personal
   appearance) as the test. It is a Hebraism from which the word
   [prosOpolempsia] (Jas 2:1) comes. Originally it meant to lift the face,
   to lift the countenance, to regard the face, to accept the face value.
   See Mr 12:13-17; Mt 22:15-22 for discussion of details here. They both
   have [blepeis] here.

   20:22 Tribute [phoron]. Old word for the annual tax on land, houses,
   etc. Mark and Matthew have [kenson], which see for this Latin word in
   Greek letters. The picture on the coin may have been that of Tiberius.

   20:23 Perceived [katanoesas]. From [katanoeO], to put the mind down on.
   Mark has [eidOs], "knowing," and Matthew [gnous], coming to know or
   grasping (second aorist active participle of [ginOskO]. Craftiness
   [panourgian]. Old word for doing any deed. Matthew has "wickedness"
   [ponerian] and Mark "hypocrisy" [hupokrisin]. Unscrupulous they
   certainly were. They would stoop to any trick and go the limit.

   20:26 They were not able [ouk ischusan]. They did not have strength. An
   old verb [ischuO] from [ischus] (strength). They failed "to take hold
   (cf. verse 20) of the saying before the people." These "crack" students
   had made an ignominious failure and were not able to make a case for
   the surrender of Jesus to Pilate. He had slipped through their net with
   the utmost ease. Held their peace [esigesan]. Ingressive aorist active
   of [sigaO]. They became silent as they went back with the "dry grins."

   20:27 There is no resurrection [anastasin me einai]. Accusative and
   infinitive with negative [me] in indirect assertion. The Sadducees
   rally after the complete discomfiture of the Pharisees and Herodians.
   They had a stock conundrum with which they had often gotten a laugh on
   the Pharisees. So they volunteer to try it on Jesus. For discussion of
   details here see on Mt 22:23-33; Mr 12:18-27. Only a few striking items
   remain for Luke.

   20:33 Had her [eschon]. Constative second aorist indicative of [echO]
   including all seven seriatim. So Mt 22:28; Mr 12:33 To wife [gunaika].
   As wife, accusative in apposition with "her."

   20:36 Equal unto the angels [isaggeloi]. A rare and late word from
   [isos], equal, and [aggelos]. Only here in the N.T. Mark and Matthew
   have "as angels" [hOs aggeloi]. Angels do not marry, there is no
   marriage in heaven. Sons of God, being sons of the resurrection [huioi
   theou tes anastaseOs huioi ontes]. This Hebraistic phrase, "sons of the
   resurrection" defines "sons of God" and is a direct answer to the
   Sadducees.

   20:37 Even Moses [kai MOuses]. Moses was used by the Sadducees to
   support their denial of the resurrection. This passage (Ex 3:6) Jesus
   skilfully uses as a proof of the resurrection. See discussion on Mt
   22:32; Mr 12:26f.

   20:39 Certain of the scribes [tines tOn grammateOn]. Pharisees who
   greatly enjoyed this use by Jesus of a portion of the Pentateuch
   against the position of the Sadducees. So they praise the reply of
   Jesus, hostile though they are to him.

   20:40 They durst not any more [ouketi etolmOn ouden]. Double negative
   and imperfect active of [tolmaO]. The courage of Pharisees, Sadducees,
   Herodians vanished.

   20:41 How say they? [POs legousin;]. The Pharisees had rallied in glee
   and one of their number, a lawyer, had made a feeble contribution to
   the controversy which resulted in his agreement with Jesus and in
   praise from Jesus (Mr 12:28-34; Mt 27:34-40). Luke does not give this
   incident which makes it plain that by "they say" [legousin] Jesus
   refers to the Pharisees (rabbis, lawyers), carrying on the discussion
   and turning the tables on them while the Pharisees are still gathered
   together (Mt 22:41). The construction with [legousin] is the usual
   infinitive and the accusative in indirect discourse. By "the Christ"
   [ton Christon] "the Messiah" is meant.

   20:42 For David himself [autos gar Daueid]. This language of Jesus
   clearly means that he treats David as the author of Ps 110). The
   inspiration of this Psalm is expressly stated in Mr 12:36; Mt 22:43
   (which see) and the Messianic character of the Psalm in all three
   Synoptics who all quote the LXX practically alike. Modern criticism
   that denies the Davidic authorship of this Psalm has to say either that
   Jesus was ignorant of the fact about it or that he declined to disturb
   the current acceptation of the Davidic authorship. Certainly modern
   scholars are not agreed on the authorship of Ps 110). Meanwhile one can
   certainly be excused for accepting the natural implication of the words
   of Jesus here, "David himself." In the book of the Psalms [en biblOi
   PsalmOn]. Compare 3:4 "in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet."

   20:44 David therefore [Daueid oun]. Without [ei] as in Mt 22:45. On the
   basis of this definite piece of exegesis [oun], therefore) Jesus
   presses the problem [pOs], how) for an explanation. The deity and the
   humanity of the Messiah in Ps 110 are thus set forth, the very problems
   that disturbed the rabbis then and that upset many critics today.

   20:45 In the hearing of all the people [akouontos pantos tou laou].
   Genitive absolute, "while all the people were listening" (present
   active participle). That is the time to speak. The details in this
   verse and verse 47 are precisely those given in Mr 12:38f., which see
   for discussion of details. Mt 23:1-39 has a very full and rich
   description of this last phase of the debate in the temple where Jesus
   drew a full-length portrait of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and
   scribes in their presence. It was a solemn climax to this last public
   appearance of Christ in the temple when Jesus poured out the vials of
   his indignation as he had done before (Mt 16:2; Lu 11:37-54; 12-1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 21

   21:1 And he looked up [Anablepsas de]. He had taken his seat, after the
   debate was over and the Sanhedrin had slunk away in sheer defeat, "over
   against the treasury" (Mr 12:41). The word for "treasury"
   [gazophulakion] is a compound of [gaza] (Persian word for royal
   treasury) and [phulake] guard or protection. It is common in the LXX,
   but in the N.T. only here and Mr 12:41,43; Joh 8:20). Jesus was
   watching (Mr 12:41) the rich put in their gifts as a slight diversion
   from the intense strain of the hours before.

   21:2 Poor [penichran]. A rare word from [penes] [penomai], to work for
   one's living). Latin penuria and Greek [peinaO], to be hungry are kin
   to it. Here only in the N.T. Mr 12:42 has [ptOche], a more common word
   from [ptOssO], to be frightened, to strike and hide from fear, to be in
   beggary. And Luke uses this adjective also of her in verse 3.

   21:3 More than they all [pleion pantOn]. Ablative case after the
   comparative [pleion].

   21:4 All these did cast [pantes houtoi ebalon]. Constative second
   aorist active indicative covering the whole crowd except the widow.
   Living [bion]. Livelihood as in Mr 12:44, not [zOen], principle of
   life.

   21:5 As some spake [tinOn legontOn]. Genitive absolute. The disciples
   we know from Mr 13:1; Mt 24:1. How [hoti]. Literally, "that." It was
   adorned [kekosmetai]. Perfect passive indicative, state of completion,
   stands adorned, tense retained in indirect discourse, though English
   has to change it. [KosmeO], old and common verb for orderly arrangement
   and adorning. With goodly stones and offerings [lithois kalois kai
   anathemasin]. Instrumental case. Some of these stones in the
   substructure were enormous. "The columns of the cloister or portico
   were monoliths of marble over forty feet high" (Plummer). Cf. Josephus,
   War, V.5. The word [anathema] (here only in the N.T.) is not to be
   confused with [anathema] from the same verb [anatithemi], but which
   came to mean a curse (Ga 1:8; Ac 23:14). So [anathema] came to mean
   devoted in a bad sense, [anathema] in a good sense. "Thus knave, lad,
   becomes a rascal; villain, a farmer, becomes a scoundrel; cunning,
   skilful, becomes crafty"(Vincent). These offerings in the temple were
   very numerous and costly (2Macc. 3:2-7) like the golden vine of Herod
   with branches as tall as a man (Josephus, Ant.XV. ii.3).

   21:6 As for these things [tauta]. Accusative of general reference. One
   stone upon another [lithos epi lithOi]. Stone upon stone (locative).
   Here both Mr 13:2; Mt 24:2 have [epi lithon] (accusative). Instead of
   [ouk aphethesetai] (future passive) they both have [ou me aphethei]
   (double negative with aorist passive subjunctive). It was a shock to
   the disciples to hear this after the triumphal entry.

   21:8 That ye be not led astray [me planethete]. First aorist passive
   subjunctive with [me] (lest). This verb [planaO] occurs here only in
   Luke though often in the rest of the N.T. (as Mt 24:4, 5, 11, 24, which
   see). Our word planet is from this word. The time is at hand [ho kairos
   eggiken]. Just as John the Baptist did of the kingdom (Mt 3:2) and
   Jesus also (Mr 1:15). Go ye not after them [me poreuthete opisO autOn].
   First aorist passive subjunctive with [me]. A needed warning today with
   all the false cries in the religious world.

   21:9 Be not terrified [me ptoethete]. First aorist passive subjunctive
   with [me] from [ptoeO] an old verb to terrify, from [ptoa], terror. In
   the N.T. only here and Lu 24:37. First [PrOton]. It is so easy to
   forget this and to insist that the end is "immediately" in spite of
   Christ's explicit denial here. See Mt 24:4-42; Mr 13:1-37 for
   discussion of details for Lu 21:8-36, the great eschatological
   discourse of Jesus

   21:11 Famines and pestilences [loimoi kai limoi]. Play on the two words
   pronounced just alike in the Koine (itacism). And terrors [phobethra
   te]. The use of [te ... te] in this verse groups the two kinds of woes.
   This rare word [phobethra] is only here in the N.T. It is from
   [phobeO], to frighten, and occurs only in the plural as here.

   21:12 But before all these things [pro de toutOn pantOn]. In Mr 13:8;
   Mt 24:8 these things are termed "the beginning of travail." That may be
   the idea here. Plummer insists that priority of time is the point, not
   magnitude. Bringing you [apagomenous]. Present passive participle from
   [apagO], an old verb to lead off or away. But here the participle is in
   the accusative plural, not the nominative like [paradidontes] (present
   active participle, delivering you up), agreeing with [humas] not
   expressed the object of [paradidontes], "you being brought before or
   led off." "A technical term in Athenian legal language" (Bruce).

   21:13 It shall turn unto you [apobesetai humin]. Future middle of
   [apobainO]. It will come off, turn out for you (dative of advantage).
   For a testimony [eis marturion]. To their loyalty to Christ. Besides,
   "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church."

   21:14 Not to meditate beforehand [me promeletain]. The classical word
   for conning a speech beforehand. Mr 13:11 has [promerimnaO], a later
   word which shows previous anxiety rather than previous preparation. How
   to answer [apologethenai]. First aorist passive infinitive. It is the
   preparation for the speech of defence (apology) that Jesus here
   forbids, not the preparation of a sermon.

   21:15 Your adversaries [hoi antikeimenoi humin]. Those who stand
   against, line up face to face with (note [anti-]. To withstand or to
   gainsay [antistenai e anteipein]. Two second aorist active infinitives
   with [anti-] in composition again. But these "antis" will go down
   before the power of Christ.

   21:16 Shall they cause to be put to death [thanatOsousin]. Future
   active of [thanatoO], to put to death or to make to die (causative).
   Either makes sense here. Old and common verb.

   21:17 Not a hair of your head shall perish [thrix ek tes kephales humOn
   ou me apoletai]. Only in Luke. Second aorist middle subjunctive of
   [apollumi] with [ou me] (double negative). Jesus has just said that
   some they will put to death. Hence it is spiritual safety here promised
   such as Paul claimed about death in Php 1:21.

   21:19 Ye shall win [ktesesthe]. Future middle of [ktaomai], to acquire.
   They will win their souls even if death does come.

   21:20 Compassed with armies [kukloumenen hupo stratopedOn]. Present
   passive participle of [kukloO], to circle, encircle, from [kuklos],
   circle. Old verb, but only four times in N.T. The point of this warning
   is the present tense, being encircled. It will be too late after the
   city is surrounded. It is objected by some that Jesus, not to say Luke,
   could not have spoken (or written) these words before the Roman armies
   came. One may ask why not, if such a thing as predictive prophecy can
   exist and especially in the case of the Lord Jesus. The word
   [stratopedOn] [stratos], army, [pedon], plain) is a military camp and
   then an army in camp. Old word, but only here in the N.T. Then know
   [tote gnOte]. Second aorist active imperative of [ginOskO]. Christians
   did flee from Jerusalem to Pella before it was too late as directed in
   Lu 21:21; Mr 13:14f.; Mt 24:16f.

   21:22 That may be fulfilled [tou plesthenai]. Articular infinitive
   passive to express purpose with accusative of general reference. The
   O.T. has many such warnings (Ho 9:7; De 28:49-57, etc.).

   21:24 Edge of the sword [stomati machaires]. Instrumental case of
   [stomati] which means "mouth" literally (Ge 34:26). This verse like the
   close of verse 22 is only in Luke. Josephus (War, VI. 9.3) states that
   1,100,000 Jews perished in the destruction of Jerusalem and 97,000 were
   taken captive. Surely this is an exaggeration and yet the number must
   have been large. Shall be led captive [aichmalOtisthesontai]. Future
   passive of [aichmalOtizO] from [aichme], spear and [halOtos]
   [haliskomai]. Here alone in the literal sense in the N.T. Shall be
   trodden under foot [estai patoumene]. Future passive periphrastic of
   [pateO], to tread, old verb. Until the times of the Gentiles be
   fulfilled [achri hou plerOthOsin kairoi ethnOn]. First aorist passive
   subjunctive with [achri hou] like [heOs hou]. What this means is not
   clear except that Paul in Ro 11:25 shows that the punishment of the
   Jews has a limit. The same idiom appears there also with [achri hou]
   and the aorist subjunctive.

   21:25 Distress [sunoche]. From [sunechO]. In the N.T. only here and 2Co
   2:4. Anguish. In perplexity [en aporiai]. State of one who is [aporos],
   who has lost his way [a] privative and [poros]. Here only in the N.T.
   though an old and common word. For the roaring of the sea [echous
   thalasses]. Our word echo (Latin echo) is this word [echos], a
   reverberating sound. Sense of rumour in Lu 4:37. Billows [salou]. Old
   word [salos] for the swell of the sea. Here only in the N.T.

   21:26 Men fainting [apopsuchontOn anthrOpOn]. Genitive absolute of
   [apopsuchO], to expire, to breathe off or out. Old word. Here only in
   N.T. Expectation [prosdokias]. Old word from [prosdokaO], to look for
   or towards. In the N.T. only here and Ac 12:11. The world [tei
   oikoumenei]. Dative case, "the inhabited" (earth, [gei].

   21:27 And then shall they see [kai tote opsontai]. As much as to say
   that it will be not till then. Clearly the promise of the second coming
   of the Son of man in glory here (Mr 13:26f.; Mt 24:30f.) is pictured as
   not one certain of immediate realization. The time element is left
   purposely vague.

   21:28 Look up [anakupsate]. First aorist active imperative of
   [anakuptO], to raise up. Here of the soul as in Joh 8:7, 10, but in Lu
   13:11 of the body. These the only N.T. examples of this common verb.
   Redemption [apolutrOsis]. Act of redeeming from [apolutroO]. The final
   act at the second coming of Christ, a glorious hope.

   21:29 The fig tree, and all the trees [ten suken kai panta ta dendra].
   This parable of the fig-tree (Mr 13:28-32; Mt 24:32-35) Luke applies to
   "all the trees." It is true about all of them, but the fig tree was
   very common in Palestine.

   21:30 Shoot forth [probalOsin]. Second aorist active subjunctive of
   [proballO], common verb, but in the N.T. only here and Ac 19:33. Summer
   [theros]. Not harvest, but summer. Old word, but in the N.T. only here
   (Mr 13:28; Mt 24:32).

   21:31 Coming to pass [ginomena]. Present middle participle of [ginomai]
   and so descriptive of the process. Nigh [eggus]. The consummation of
   the kingdom is here meant, not the beginning.

   21:32 This generation [he genea haute]. Naturally people then living.
   Shall not pass away [ou me parelthei]. Second aorist active subjunctive
   of [parerchomai]. Strongest possible negative with [ou me]. Till all
   things be accomplished [heOs an panta genetai]. Second aorist middle
   subjunctive of [ginomai] with [heOs], common idiom. The words give a
   great deal of trouble to critics. Some apply them to the whole
   discourse including the destruction of the temple and Jerusalem, the
   second coming and the end of the world. Some of these argue that Jesus
   was simply mistaken in his eschatology, some that he has not been
   properly reported in the Gospels. Others apply them only to the
   destruction of Jerusalem which did take place in A.D. 70 before that
   generation passed away. It must be said for this view that it is not
   easy in this great eschatological discourse to tell clearly when Jesus
   is discussing the destruction of Jerusalem and when the second coming.
   Plummer offers this solution: "The reference, therefore, is to the
   destruction of Jerusalem regarded as the type of the end of the world."

   21:33 My words shall not pass away [hoi logoi mou ou me pareleusontai].
   Future middle indicative with [ou me], a bit stronger statement than
   the subjunctive. It is noteworthy that Jesus utters these words just
   after the difficult prediction in verse 32.

   21:34 Lest haply your hearts be overcharged [me pote barethOsin hai
   kardiai humOn]. First aorist passive subjunctive of [bareO], an old
   verb to weigh down, depress, with [me pote]. With surfeiting [en
   krepalei]. A rather late word, common in medical writers for the nausea
   that follows a debauch. Latin crapula, the giddiness caused by too much
   wine. Here only in the N.T. Drunkenness [methei]. From [methu] (wine).
   Old word but in the N.T. only here and Ro 13:13; Ga 5:21. Cares of this
   life [merimnais biOtikais]. Anxieties of life. The adjective [biOtikos]
   is late and in the N.T. only here and 1Co 6:3f. Come on you [epistei].
   Second aorist active subjunctive of [ephistemi], ingressive aorist.
   Construed also with [me pote]. Suddenly [ephnidios]. Adjective in
   predicate agreeing with [hemera] (day). As a snare [hOs pagis]. Old
   word from [pegnumi], to make fast a net or trap. Paul uses it several
   times of the devil's snares for preachers (1Ti 3:7; 2Ti 2:26).

   21:36 But watch ye [agrupneite de]. [AgrupneO] is a late verb to be
   sleepless [a] privative and [hupnos], sleep). Keep awake and be ready
   is the pith of Christ's warning. That ye may prevail to escape [hina
   katischusete ekphugein]. First aorist active subjunctive with [hina] of
   purpose. The verb [katischuO] means to have strength against (cf. Mt
   16:18). Common in later writers. [Ekphugein] is second aorist active
   infinitive, to escape out. To stand before the Son of man [stathenai
   emprosthen tou huiou tou anthrOpou]. That is the goal. There will be no
   dread of the Son then if one is ready. [Stathenai] is first aorist
   passive infinitive of [histemi].

   21:37 Every day [tas hemeras]. During the days, accusative of extent of
   time. Every night [tas nuktas]. "During the nights," accusative of
   extent of time. Lodged [eulizeto]. Imperfect middle, was lodging,
   [aulizomai] from [aule] (court).

   21:38 Came early [Orthrizen]. Imperfect active of [orthrizO] from
   [orthros], late form for [orthreuO], to rise early. Only here in the
   N.T.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 22

   22:1 The Passover [pascha] Both names (unleavened bread and passover)
   are used here as in Mr 14:1. Strictly speaking the passover was Nisan
   14 and the unleavened bread 15-21). This is the only place in the N.T.
   where the expression "the feast of unleavened bread" (common in LXX,
   Ex. 23:15, etc.) occurs, for Mr 14:1 has just "the unleavened bread."
   Mt 26:17 uses unleavened bread and passover interchangeably. Drew nigh
   [eggizen]. Imperfect active. Mr 14:1; Mt 26:2 mention "after two days"
   definitely.

   22:2 Sought [ezetoun]. Imperfect active of [zeteO], were seeking,
   conative imperfect. How they might put him to death [to pOs anelOsin
   auton]. Second aorist active deliberative subjunctive (retained in
   indirect question) of [anaireO], to take up, to make away with, to
   slay. Common in Old Greek. Luke uses it so here and in 23:32 and
   eighteen times in the Acts, a favourite word with him. Note the
   accusative neuter singular article [to] with the whole clause, "as to
   the how, etc." For they feared [ephobounto gar]. Imperfect middle
   describing the delay of the "how." The triumphal entry and the temple
   speeches of Jesus had revealed his tremendous power with the people,
   especially the crowds from Galilee at the feast. They were afraid to go
   on with their plan to kill him at the feast.

   22:3 Satan entered into Judas [eiselthen eis Ioudan]. Ingressive aorist
   active indicative. Satan was now renewing his attack on Jesus suspended
   temporarily (Lu 4:13) "until a good chance." He had come back by the
   use of Simon Peter (Mr 8:33; Mt 16:23). The conflict went on and Jesus
   won ultimate victory (Lu 10:18). Now Satan uses Judas and has success
   with him for Judas allowed him to come again and again (Joh 13:27).
   Judas evidently opened the door to his heart and let Satan in. Then
   Satan took charge and he became a devil as Jesus said (Joh 6:70). This
   surrender to Satan in no way relieves Judas of his moral
   responsibility.

   22:4 Went away [apelthOn]. Second aorist active participle of
   [aperchomai]. He went off under the impulse of Satan and after the
   indignation over the rebuke of Jesus at the feast in Simon's house (Joh
   12:4-6). Captains [strategois]. Leaders of the temple guards (Ac 4:1),
   the full title, "captains of the temple," occurs in verse 52. How he
   might deliver him unto them [to pOs autois paradOi auton]. The same
   construction as in verse 2, the article [to] with the indirect question
   and deliberative subjunctive second aorist active [paradOi].

   22:5 Were glad [echaresan]. Second aorist passive indicative of
   [chairO] as in Mr 14:11. Ingressive aorist, a natural exultation that
   one of the Twelve had offered to do this thing. Covenanted
   [sunethento]. Second aorist indicative middle of [suntithemi]. An old
   verb to put together and in the middle with one another. In the N.T.
   outside of Joh 9:22 only in Luke (here and Ac 23:20; 24:9). Luke only
   mentions "money" [argurion], but not "thirty pieces" (Mt 26:15).

   22:6 Consented [exOmologesen]. Old verb, but the ancients usually used
   the simple form for promise or consent rather than the compound. This
   is the only instance of this sense in the N.T. It is from [homologos]
   [homos], same, and [legO], to say), to say the same thing with another
   and so agree. Opportunity [eukarian]. From [eukairos] [eu, kairos], a
   good chance. Old word, but in the N.T. only here and parallel passage
   Mt 26:16. In the absence of the multitude [ater ochlou]. [Ater] is an
   old preposition, common in the poets, but rare in prose. Also in verse
   35. It means "without," "apart from," like [chOris]. The point of Judas
   was just this. He would get Jesus into the hands of the Sanhedrin
   during the feast in spite of the crowd. It was necessary to avoid
   tumult (Mt 26:5) because of the popularity of Jesus.

   22:7 The day of unleavened bread came [elthen he hemera tOn azumOn].
   The day itself came, not simply was drawing nigh (verse 1. Must be
   sacrificed [edei thuesthai]. This was Nisan 14 which began at sunset.
   Luke is a Gentile and this fact must be borne in mind. The lamb must be
   slain by the head of the family (Ex 12:6). The controversy about the
   day when Christ ate the last passover meal has already been discussed
   (Mt 26:17; Mr 14:12). The Synoptics clearly present this as a fact.
   Jesus was then crucified on Friday at the passover or Thursday (our
   time) at the regular hour 6 P.M. (beginning of Friday). The five
   passages in John (13:1f.; 13:27; 18:28; 19:14; 19:31) rightly
   interpreted teach the same thing as shown in my Harmony of the Gospels
   for Students of the Life of Christ (pp.279-284).

   22:8 Peter and John [Petron kai IOanen]. Mr 14:13 has only "two" while
   Mt 26:17 makes the disciples take the initiative. The word passover in
   this context is used either of the meal, the feast day, the whole
   period (including the unleavened bread). "Eat the passover" can refer
   to the meal as here or to the whole period of celebration (Joh 18:28).

   22:9 Where wilt thou that we make ready? [Pou theleis hetoimasOmen;].
   Deliberative first aorist active subjunctive without [hina] after
   [theleis], perhaps originally two separate questions.

   22:10 When you are entered [eiselthontOn humOn]. Genitive absolute.
   Meet you [sunantesei humin]. An old verb [sunantaO] (from [sun], with,
   and [antaO], to face, [anti] with associative instrumental [humin]. See
   on Mr 14:13 about the "man bearing a pitcher of water."

   22:11 Goodman of the house [oikodespotei]. Master of the house as in Mr
   14:14; Mt 10:25. A late word for the earlier [despotes oikou]. I shall
   eat [phagO]. Second aorist futuristic (or deliberative) subjunctive as
   in Mr 14:14.

   22:12 And he [k'akeinos]. [Kai] and [ekeinos] [crasis] where Mr 14:15
   has [kai autos]. Literally, And that one. See on Mark for rest of the
   verse.

   22:13 He had said [eirekei]. Past perfect active indicative of [eipon]
   where Mr 14:16 has [eipen] (second aorist).

   22:14 Sat down [anepesen]. Reclined, fell back (or up). Second aorist
   active of [anapiptO].

   22:15 With desire I have desired [epithumiai epethumesa]. A Hebraism
   common in the LXX. Associative instrumental case of substantive and
   first aorist active indicative of same like a cognate accusative.
   Peculiar to Luke is all this verse. See this idiom in Joh 3:29; Ac
   4:17. Before I suffer [pro tou me pathein]. Preposition [pro] with
   articular infinitive and accusative of general reference, "before the
   suffering as to me." [Pathein] is second aorist active infinitive of
   [paschO].

   22:16 Until it be fulfilled [heOs hotou plerOthei]. First aorist
   passive subjunctive of [pleroO] with [heOs] [hotou], the usual
   construction about the future. It seems like a Messianic banquet that
   Jesus has in mind (cf. 14:15).

   22:17 He received a cup [dexamenos poterion]. This cup is a diminutive
   of [poter]. It seems that this is still one of the four cups passed
   during the passover meal, though which one is uncertain. It is
   apparently just before the formal introduction of the Lord's Supper,
   though he gave thanks here also [eucharistesas]. It is from this verb
   [eucharisteO] (see also verse 19) that our word Eucharist comes. It is
   a common verb for giving thanks and was used also for "saying grace" as
   we call it.

   22:18 The fruit of the vine [tou genematos tes ampelou]. So Mr 14:25;
   Mt 26:29 and not [oinos] though it was wine undoubtedly. But the
   language allows anything that is "the fruit of the vine." Come
   [elthei]. Second aorist active subjunctive with [heOs] as in verse 16.
   Here it is the consummation of the kingdom that Jesus has in mind, for
   the kingdom had already come.

   22:19 Which is given for you [to huper humOn didomenon]. Some MSS. omit
   these verses though probably genuine. The correct text in 1Co 11:24 has
   "which is for you," not "which is broken for you." It is curious to
   find the word "broken" here preserved and justified so often, even by
   Easton in his commentary on Luke, p. 320). In remembrance of me [eis
   ten emen anamnesin]. Objective use of the possessive pronoun [emen],
   not the subjective. This do [touto poieite]. Present active indicative,
   repetition, keep on doing this.

   22:20 After the supper [meta to deipnesai]. Preposition [meta] and the
   accusative articular infinitive. The textual situation here is
   confusing, chiefly because of the two cups (verses 17, 20). Some of the
   documents omit the latter part of verse 19 and all of verse 20). It is
   possible, of course, that this part crept into the text of Luke from
   1Co 11:24f. But, if this part is omitted, Luke would then have the
   order reversed, the cup before the bread. So there are difficulties
   whichever turn one takes here with Luke's text whether one cup or two
   cups. The New Covenant [he kaine diatheke]. See on Mt 26:28; Mr 14:24
   for "covenant." Westcott and Hort reject "new" there, but accept it
   here and in 1Co 11:25. See on Lu 5:38 for difference between [kaine]
   and [nea]. "The ratification of a covenant was commonly associated with
   the shedding of blood; and what was written in blood was believed to be
   indelible" (Plummer). Poured out [ekchunnomenon]. Same word in Mr
   14:24; Mt 26:28 translated "shed." Late form present passive participle
   of [ekchunnO] of [ekcheO], to pour out.

   22:21 That betrayeth [tou paradidontos]. Present active participle,
   actually engaged in doing it. The hand of Judas was resting on the
   table at the moment. It should be noted that Luke narrates the
   institution of the Lord's Supper before the exposure of Judas as the
   traitor while Mark and Matthew reverse this order.

   22:22 As it hath been determined [kata to hOrismenon]. Perfect passive
   participle of [horizO], to limit or define, mark off the border, our
   "horizon." But this fact does not absolve Judas of his guilt as the
   "woe" here makes plain.

   22:23 Which of them it was [to tis ara eie ex autOn]. Note the article
   [to] with the indirect question as in verses 2, 4. The optative [eie]
   here is changed from the present active indicative [estin], though it
   was not always done, for see [dokei] in verse 24 where the present
   indicative is retained. They all had their hands on the table. Whose
   hand was it?

   22:24 Contention [philoneikia]. An old word from [philoneikos], fond of
   strife, eagerness to contend. Only here in the N.T. Greatest [meizOn].
   Common use of the comparative as superlative.

   22:25 Have lordship over [kurieuousin]. From [kurios]. Common verb, to
   lord it over. Benefactors [euergetai]. From [eu] and [ergon]. Doer of
   good. Old word. Here only in the N.T. Latin Benefactor is exact
   equivalent.

   22:26 Become [ginesthO]. Present middle imperative of [ginomai]. Act
   so. True greatness is in service, not in rank.

   22:27 But I [EgO de]. Jesus dares to cite his own conduct, though their
   leader, to prove his point and to put a stop to their jealous
   contention for the chief place at this very feast, a wrangling that
   kept up till Jesus had to arise and give them the object lesson of
   humility by washing their feet (Joh 13:1-20).

   22:28 In my temptations [en tois peirasmois mou]. Probably "trials" is
   better here as in Jas 1:2 though temptations clearly in Jas 1:13ff.
   This is the tragedy of the situation when Jesus is facing the Cross
   with the traitor at the table and the rest chiefly concerned about
   their own primacy and dignity.

   22:29 And I appoint unto you [k'agO diatithemai humin]. They had on the
   whole been loyal and so Jesus passes on to them [diathemai] verb from
   which [diatheke] comes).

   22:30 And ye shall sit [kathesesthe]. But Westcott and Hort read in the
   text [kathesthe] (present middle subjunctive with [hina]. The picture
   seems to be that given in Mt 19:28 when Jesus replied to Peter's
   inquiry. It is not clear how literally this imagery is to be taken. But
   there is the promise of honour for the loyal among these in the end.

   22:31 Asked to have you [exeitesato]. First aorist indirect middle
   indicative of [exaiteO], an old verb to beg something of one and
   (middle) for oneself. Only here in the N.T. The verb is used either in
   the good or the bad sense, but it does not mean here "obtained by
   asking" as margin in Revised Version has it. That he might sift you
   [tou siniasai]. Genitive articular infinitive of purpose. First aorist
   active infinitive of [siniazO], to shake a sieve, to sift, from
   [sinion], a winnowing fan. Later word. Here only in the N.T.

   22:32 That thy faith fail not [hina me eklipei he pistis mou]. Second
   aorist active subjunctive of purpose with [hina] after [edeethen] (I
   prayed) of [ekleipO], old verb. Our word eclipse is this word.
   Evidently Jesus could not keep Satan from attacking Peter. He had
   already captured Judas. Did he not repeatedly attack Jesus? But he
   could and did pray for Peter's faith and his praying won in the end,
   though Peter stumbled and fell. And do thou [kai su]. The words single
   out Peter sharply. Once thou hast turned again [pote epistrepsas].
   First aorist active participle of [epistrephO], common verb to turn to,
   to return. But the use of this word implied that Peter would fall
   though he would come back and "strengthen thy brethren."

   22:33 To prison and to death [eis phulaken kai eis thanaton]. Evidently
   Peter was not flattered by the need of Christ's earnest prayers for his
   welfare and loyalty. Hence this loud boast.

   22:34 Until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me [heOs tris me
   aparnesei eidenai]. "Thrice" is in all four Gospels here for they all
   give this warning to Peter (Mr 14:30; Mt 26:34; Lu 22:34; Joh 18:38).
   Peter will even deny knowing Jesus [eidenai].

   22:35 Without purse [ater ballantiou]. Money bag or purse. Old word,
   but in the N.T. only in Luke (10:4; 12:33; 22:35ff.). Wallet [peras].
   See on Mt 10:10). Lacked ye anything [me tinos husteresate;]. Answer No
   expected [outhenos] below). Ablative case after [hustereO].

   22:36 Buy a sword [agorasatO machairan]. This is for defence clearly.
   The reference is to the special mission in Galilee (Lu 9:1-6; Mr
   6:6-13; Mt 9:35-11:1. They are to expect persecution and bitter
   hostility (Joh 15:18-21). Jesus does not mean that his disciples are to
   repel force by force, but that they are to be ready to defend his cause
   against attack. Changed conditions bring changed needs. This language
   can be misunderstood as it was then.

   22:38 Lord, behold, here are two swords [kurie idou machairai hOde
   duo]. They took his words literally. And before this very night is over
   Peter will use one of these very swords to try to cut off the head of
   Malchus only to be sternly rebuked by Jesus (Mr 14:47; Mt 26:51f.; Lu
   22:50f.; Joh 18:10f.). Then Jesus will say: "For all that take the
   sword shall perish with the sword" (Mt 26:52). Clearly Jesus did not
   mean his language even about the sword to be pressed too literally. So
   he said: "It is enough" [Hikanon estin]. It is with sad irony and
   sorrow that Jesus thus dismisses the subject. They were in no humour
   now to understand the various sides of this complicated problem. Every
   preacher and teacher understands this mood, not of impatience, but of
   closing the subject for the present.

   22:39 As his custom was [kata to ethos]. According to the custom (of
   him). It was because Judas knew the habit of Jesus of going to
   Gethsemane at night that he undertook to betray him without waiting for
   the crowd to go home after the feast.

   22:40 At the place [epi tou topou]. The place of secret prayer which
   was dear to Jesus. Pray that ye enter not into temptation
   [proseuchesthe me eiselthein eis peirasmon]. "Keep on praying not to
   enter (ingressive aorist infinitive, not even once) into temptation."
   It is real "temptation" here, not just "trial." Jesus knew the power of
   temptation and the need of prayer. These words throw a light on the
   meaning of his language in Mt 6:13. Jesus repeats this warning in verse
   46.

   22:41 About a stone's throw [hOsei lithou bolen]. Accusative of extent
   of space. Luke does not tell of leaving eight disciples by the entrance
   to Gethsemane nor about taking Peter, James, and John further in with
   him. Kneeled down [theis ta gonata]. Second aorist active participle
   from [tithemi]. Mr 14:35 says "fell on the ground" and Mt 26:39 "fell
   on his face." All could be true at different moments. Prayed
   [proseucheto]. Imperfect middle, was praying, kept on praying.

   22:42 If thou be willing [ei boulei]. This condition is in the first
   petition at the start. Be done [ginesthO]. Present middle imperative,
   keep on being done, the Father's will.

   22:43 An angel [aggelos]. The angels visited Jesus at the close of the
   three temptations at the beginning of his ministry (Mt 4:11). Here the
   angel comes during the conflict.

   22:44 In an agony [en agOniai]. It was conflict, contest from [agOn].
   An old word, but only here in the N.T. Satan pressed Jesus harder than
   ever before. As it were great drops of blood [hOsei thromboi haimatos].
   Thick, clotted blood. An old word [thromboi] common in medical works,
   but here only in the N.T. This passage (verses 43, 44) is absent from
   some ancient documents. Aristotle speaks of a bloody sweat as does
   Theophrastus.

   22:45 Sleeping for sorrow [koimOmenous apo tes lupes]. Luke does not
   tell of the three turnings of Jesus to the trusted three for human
   sympathy.

   22:46 Why sleep ye? [Ti katheudete;]. This reproach Luke gives, but not
   the almost bitter details in Mr 14:37-42; Mt 26:40-46).

   22:47 Went before them [proercheto]. Imperfect middle. Judas was
   leading the band for he knew the place well (Joh 18:2).

   22:48 With a kiss [philemati]. Instrumental case. Jesus challenges the
   act of Judas openly and calls it betrayal, but it did not stop him.

   22:49 What would follow [to esomenon]. Article and the future middle
   participle of [eimi], to be. Shall we smite with a sword? [ei pataxomen
   en machairei;]. Note [ei] in a direct question like the Hebrew. Luke
   alone gives this question. Instrumental use of [en]. They had the two
   swords already mentioned (22:38).

   22:50 His right ear [to ous autou to dexion]. Mark 14:47; Mt 26:51 do
   not mention "right," but Luke the Physician does. Joh 18:10 follows
   Luke in this item and also adds the names of Peter and of Malchus since
   probably both were dead by that time and Peter would not be involved in
   trouble.

   22:51 Suffer us thus far [eate heOs toutou]. Present active imperative
   of [eaO], to allow. But the meaning is not clear. If addressed to Peter
   and the other disciples it means that they are to suffer this much of
   violence against Jesus. This is probably the idea. If it is addressed
   to the crowd, it means that they are to excuse Peter for his rash act.
   He touched his ear and healed him [hapsamenos tou otiou iasato auton].
   Whether Jesus picked up the piece of the ear and put it back is not
   said. He could have healed the wound without that. This miracle of
   surgery is given alone by Luke.

   22:52 As against a robber? [hOs epi leisten;]. They were treating Jesus
   as if he were a bandit like Barabbas.

   22:53 But this is your hour [all' haute estin humOn he hOra]. So Jesus
   surrenders. The moral value of his atoning sacrifice on the Cross
   consists in the voluntariness of his death. He makes it clear that they
   have taken undue advantage of him in this hour of secret prayer and had
   failed to seize him in public in the temple. But "the power of
   darkness" [he exousia tou skotous], had its turn. A better day will
   come. The might, authority of darkness.

   22:54 Into the high priest's house [eis ten oikian tou archiereOs].
   Luke alone mentions "the house." Though it is implied in Mr 14:53; Mt
   26:57. Followed [ekolouthei]. Imperfect, was following, as Mt 26:58;
   Joh 18:15. Curiously Mr 14:54 has the aorist.

   22:55 When they had kindled a fire [periapsantOn pur]. Genitive
   absolute, first aorist active participle of [periaptO], an old verb,
   but here only in the N.T. Kindle around, make a good fire that blazes
   all over. It was April and cool at night. The servants made the fire.
   And had sat down together [kai sunkathisantOn]. Genitive absolute
   again. Note [sun-] (together), all had taken seats around the fire.
   Peter sat in the midst of them [ekatheto ho Petros mesos autOn].
   Imperfect tense, he was sitting, and note [mesos], nominative predicate
   adjective with the genitive, like Joh 1:26, good Greek idiom.

   22:56 In the light [pros to phOs]. Facing [pros] the light, for the
   fire gave light as well as heat. Mr 14:65 has "warming himself in the
   light," John (Joh 18:18,25) "warming himself." Looking steadfastly
   [atenisasa]. Favourite word in Luke (4:20, etc.) for gazing steadily at
   one. This man also [kai houtos]. As if pointing to Peter and talking
   about him. The other Gospels (Mr 14:67; Mt 26:69; Joh 18:25) make a
   direct address to Peter. Both could be true, as she turned to Peter.

   22:57 I know him not [ouk oida auton]. Just as Jesus had predicted that
   he would do (Lu 22:34).

   22:58 After a little while another [meta brachu heteros]. Mt 26:71
   makes it after Peter had gone out into the porch and mentions a maid as
   speaking as does Mr 14:69, while here the "other" [heteros] is a man
   (masculine gender). It is almost impossible to co-ordinate the three
   denials in the four accounts unless we conceive of several joining in
   when one led off. This time Peter's denial is very blunt, "I am not."

   22:59 After the space of about one hour [diastases hOsei hOras mias].
   Genitive absolute with second aorist active participle feminine
   singular of [diistemi]. This classical verb in the N.T. is used only by
   Luke (22:59; 24:51; Ac 27:28). It means standing in two or apart, about
   an hour intervening. Confidently affirmed [diischurizeto]. Imperfect
   middle, he kept affirming strongly. An old verb [dia, ischurizomai], to
   make oneself strong, to make emphatic declaration. In the N.T. only
   here and Ac 12:15. For he is a Galilean [kai gar Galilaios estin]. Mt
   26:73 makes it plain that it was his speech that gave him away, which
   see.

   22:60 I know not what thou sayest [ouk oida ho legeis]. Each denial
   tangles Peter more and more. While he yet spake [eti lalountos autou].
   Genitive absolute. Peter could hear the crowing all right.

   22:61 The Lord turned [strapheis ho kurios]. Second aorist passive
   participle of [strephO], coming verb. Graphic picture drawn by Luke
   alone. Looked upon Peter [eneblepsen tOi PetrOi]. Ingressive aorist
   active indicative of [enblepO], an old and vivid verb, to glance at.
   Remembered [hupemnesthe]. First aorist passive indicative of
   [hupomimneskO], common verb to remind one of something [hupo] giving a
   suggestion or hint). The cock crowing and the look brought swiftly back
   to Peter's mind the prophecy of Jesus and his sad denials. The mystery
   is how he had forgotten that warning.

   22:62 And he went out and wept bitterly [kai exelthOn exO eklausen
   pikrOs]. A few old Latin documents omit this verse which is genuine in
   Mt 26:75. It may be an insertion here from there, but the evidence for
   the rejection is too slight. It is the ingressive aorist [eklausen], he
   burst into tears. "Bitter" is a common expression for tears in all
   languages and in all hearts.

   22:63 That held [hoi sunechontes]. See on 8:45; 19:43 for this verb
   [sunechO]. Here alone in the N.T. for holding a prisoner (holding
   together). The servants or soldiers, not the Sanhedrin. Mocked
   [enepaizon]. Imperfect active, were mocking, inchoative, began to mock,
   to play like boys. And beat him [derontes]. Present active participle
   of [derO], to flay, tan, or hide. Literally, "beating."

   22:64 Blindfolded [perikalupsantes]. First aorist active participle of
   [perikaluptO], old verb, to put a veil around. In the N.T. only here
   and Mr 14:65. See Mr 14:65; Mt 26:67f. for further discussion.

   22:65 Many other things [hetera polla]. These are just samples.

   22:66 As soon as it was day [hOs egeneto hemera]. Mr 15:1 (Mt 27:1) has
   "morning." The assembly of the people [to presbuterion tou laou]. The
   technical word for "the eldership" (from [presbuteros], an old man or
   elder) or group of the elders composing the Sanhedrin. The word occurs
   in the LXX for the Sanhedrin. In the N.T. occurs only here and Ac 22:5
   of the Sanhedrin. In 1Ti 4:14 Paul uses it of the elders in a church
   (or churches). The Sanhedrin was composed of the elders and scribes and
   chief priests (Mr 15:1) and all three groups are at this meeting.
   Luke's language (both chief priests and scribes, [te . . . kai] seems
   to apply the word [presbuterion] to the whole Sanhedrin. Sadducees
   (chief priests) and Pharisees (scribes) were nearly equally
   represented. Into their council [eis to sunedrion autOn]. The place of
   the gathering is not given, but Jesus was led into the council chamber.

   22:67 If thou art the Christ [Ei su ei ho Christos]. The Messiah, they
   mean. The condition is the first class, assuming it to be true. If I
   tell you [Ean humin eipO]. Condition of the third class, undetermined,
   but with likelihood of being determined. This is the second appearance
   of Jesus before the Sanhedrin merely mentioned by Mr 15:1; Mt 27:1 who
   give in detail the first appearance and trial. Luke merely gives this
   so-called ratification meeting after daybreak to give the appearance of
   legality to their vote of condemnation already taken (Mr 14:64; Mt
   26:66). Ye will not believe (ou me pisteusete]. Double negative with
   the aorist subjunctive, strongest possible negative. So as to verse 68.

   22:69 The Son of man [ho huios tou anthrOpou]. Jesus really answers
   their demand about "the Messiah" by asserting that he is "the Son of
   man" and they so understand him. He makes claims of equality with God
   also which they take up.

   22:70 Art thou the Son of God? [Su oun ei ho huios tou theou;]. Note
   how these three epithets are used as practical equivalents. They ask
   about "the Messiah." Jesus affirms that he is the Son of Man and will
   sit at the right hand of the power of God. They take this to be a claim
   to be the Son of God (both humanity and deity). Jesus accepts the
   challenge and admits that he claims to be all three (Messiah, the Son
   of man, the Son of God). Ye say [Humeis legete]. Just a Greek idiom for
   "Yes" (compare "I am" in Mr 14:62 with "Thou has said" in Mt 26:64).

   22:71 For we ourselves have heard [autoi gar ekousamen]. They were
   right if Jesus is not what he claimed to be. They were eternally wrong
   for he is the Christ, the Son of man, the Son of God. They made their
   choice and must face Christ as Judge.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 23

   23:1 The whole company [hapan to plethos]. All but Nicodemus and Joseph
   of Arimathea who were probably not invited to this meeting.

   23:2 Began to accuse [erxanto kategorein]. They went at it and kept it
   up. Luke mentions three, but neither of them includes their real reason
   nor do they mention their own condemnation of Jesus. They had indulged
   their hatred in doing it, but they no longer have the power of life and
   death. Hence they say nothing to Pilate of that. We found [heuramen].
   Second aorist active indicative with first aorist vowel [a]. Probably
   they mean that they had caught Jesus in the act of doing these things
   (in flagrante delicto) rather than discovery by formal trial.
   Perverting our nation [diastrephonta to ethnos hemOn]. Present active
   participle of [diastrephO], old verb to turn this way and that,
   distort, disturb. In the N.T. only here and Ac 13:10). The Sanhedrin
   imply that the great popularity of Jesus was seditious. Forbidding to
   give tribute to Caesar, [kOluonta phorous kaisari didonai]. Note object
   infinitive [didonai] after the participle [kOluonta]. Literally,
   hindering giving tribute to Caesar. This was a flat untruth. Their
   bright young students had tried desperately to get Jesus to say this
   very thing, but they had failed utterly (Lu 20:25). Saying that he
   himself is Christ a king [legonta hauton Christon basilea einai]. Note
   the indirect discourse here after the participle [legonta] with the
   accusative [hauton] where [auton] could have been used), and the
   infinitive. This charge is true, but not in the sense meant by them.
   Jesus did claim to be the Christ and the king of the kingdom of God.
   But the Sanhedrin wanted Pilate to think that he set himself up as a
   rival to Caesar. Pilate would understand little from the word "Christ,"
   but "King" was a different matter. He was compelled to take notice of
   this charge else he himself would be accused to Caesar of winking at
   such a claim by Jesus.

   23:3 Thou sayest [su legeis]. A real affirmative as in 22:70). The
   Gospels all give Pilate's question about Jesus asking of the Jews in
   precisely the same words (Mr 15:2; Mt 27:11; Lu 23:3; Joh 18:33).

   23:4 The multitude [tous ochlous]. The first mention of them. It is now
   after daybreak. The procession of the Sanhedrin would draw a crowd
   (Plummer) and some may have come to ask for the release of a prisoner
   (Mr 15:8). There was need of haste if the condemnation went through
   before friends of Jesus came. I find no fault [ouden heuriskO aition].
   In the N.T. Luke alone uses this old adjective [aitios] (Lu 23:4,14,22;
   Ac 19:40) except Heb. 5:9. It means one who is the author, the cause of
   or responsible for anything. Luke does not give the explanation of this
   sudden decision of Pilate that Jesus is innocent. Evidently he held a
   careful examination before he delivered his judgment on the case. That
   conversation is given in Joh 18:33-38. Pilate took Jesus inside the
   palace from the upper gallery (Joh 18:33) and then came out and
   rendered his decision to the Sanhedrin (Joh 18:38) who would not go
   into the palace of Pilate (Joh 18:28).

   23:5 But they were the more urgent [hoi de epischuon]. Imperfect active
   of [epischuO], to give added [epi] strength [ischuO]. And they kept
   insisting. Evidently Pilate had taken the thing too lightly. He stirred
   up the people [anaseiei ton laon]. This compound is rare, though old
   (Thucydides), to shake up (back and forth). This is a more vigorous
   repetition of the first charge (verse 2, "perverting our nation").
   Beginning from Galilee [arxamenos apo tes Galilaias]. These very words
   occur in the address of Peter to the group in the house of Cornelius
   (Ac 10:37). The idiomatic use of [arxamenos] appears also in Ac 1:22.
   Galilee (Grote) was the mother of seditious men (see Josephus).

   23:6 A Galilean [Galilaios]. If so, here was a way out for Herod
   without going back on his own decision.

   23:7 When he knew [epignous]. Second aorist active participle from
   [epiginOskO], having gained full [epi], added knowledge). Of Herod's
   jurisdiction [ek tes exousias HerOidou]. Herod was naturally jealous of
   any encroachment by Pilate, the Roman Procurator of Judea. So here was
   a chance to respect the prerogative [exousia] of Herod and get rid of
   this troublesome case also. Sent him up [anepempsen]. First aorist
   active indicative of [anapempO]. This common verb is used of sending
   back as in verse 11 or of sending up to a higher court as of Paul to
   Caesar (Ac 25:21). Who himself also was [onta kai auton]. Being also
   himself in Jerusalem. Present active participle of [eimi].

   23:8 Was exceeding glad [echare lian]. Second aorist passive indicative
   of [chairO], ingressive aorist, became glad. Of a long time [ex hikanOn
   chronOn]. For this idiom see 8:27; 20:9; Ac 8:11. He hoped [elpizen].
   Imperfect active. He was still hoping. He had long ago gotten over his
   fright that Jesus was John the Baptist come to life again (9:7-9). Done
   [ginomenon]. Present middle participle. He wanted to see a miracle
   happening like a stunt of a sleight-of-hand performer.

   23:9 He questioned [eperOta]. Imperfect active, kept on questioning. In
   many words [en logois hikanois]. Same use of [hikanos] as in verse 8.

   23:10 Stood [histekeisan]. Second perfect active intransitive of
   [histemi] with sense of imperfect. They stood by while Herod quizzed
   Jesus and when he refused to answer, they broke loose with their
   accusations like a pack of hounds with full voice [eutonOs], adverb
   from adjective [eutonos], from [eu], well, and [teinO], to stretch,
   well tuned). Old word, but in the N.T. only here and Ac 18:28.

   23:11 Set him at nought [exouthenesas]. First aorist active participle
   from [exoutheneO], to count as nothing, to treat with utter contempt,
   as zero. Arraying him in gorgeous apparel [peribalOn estheta lampran].
   Second aorist active participle of [periballO], to fling around one.
   [Lampran] is brilliant, shining as in Jas 2:2, so different from the
   modest dress of the Master. This was part of the shame.

   23:12 For before they were at enmity between themselves [prouperchon
   gar en echthrai ontes pros heautous]. A periphrastic imperfect of the
   double compound [prouperchO], an old verb, to exist [huparchO]
   previously [pro-], here alone in the N.T., with [ontes] (participle of
   [eimi] added.

   23:13 Called together [sunkalesamenos]. First aorist middle participle
   (to himself). Pilate included "the people" in the hope that Jesus might
   have some friends among them.

   23:14 As one that perverteth the people [hOs apostrephonta ton laon].
   Pilate here condenses the three charges in verse 2 into one (Plummer).
   He uses a more common compound of [strephO] here, [apostrephO], to turn
   away from, to seduce, to mislead, whereas [diastrephO] in verse 2 has
   more the notion of disturbing (turning this way and that). Note the use
   of [hOs] with the particle, the alleged reason. Pilate understands the
   charge against Jesus to be that he is a revolutionary agitator and a
   dangerous rival to Caesar, treason in plain words. Having examined him
   before you [enOpion humOn anakrinas]. Right before your eyes I have
   given him a careful examination [ana] up and down, [krinO], to judge,
   sift. Old and common verb in the general sense and in the forensic
   sense as here and which Luke alone has in the N.T. (Lu 23:14; 4:9;
   12:19; 28:18; Ac 24:8) except 1Co 9:3. Whereof [hOn]. Attraction of the
   relative [ha] to the case (genitive) of the unexpressed antecedent
   [toutOn].

   23:15 No nor yet [all' oude]. But not even. Hath been done by him
   [estin pepragmenon autOi]. Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of
   [prassO], common verb, to do. The case of [autOi] can be regarded as
   either the dative or the instrumental (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 534,
   542).

   23:16 Chastise [paideusas]. First aorist active participle of
   [paideuO], to train a child [pais], and then, as a part of the
   training, punishment. Our English word chasten is from the Latin
   castus, pure, chaste, and means to purify (cf. Heb 12:6f.). Perhaps
   Pilate may have split a hair over the word as Wycliff puts it: "I shall
   deliver him amended." But, if Jesus was innocent, Pilate had no doubt
   to "chastise" him to satisfy a mob. Verse 17 is omitted by Westcott and
   Hort as from Mr 15:6; Mt 27:15.

   23:18 All together [panplethei]. An adverb from the adjective
   [panplethes], all together. Used by Dio Cassius. Only here in the N.T.
   Away [aire]. Present active imperative, Take him on away and keep him
   away as in Ac 21:36; 22:22, of Paul. But release [apoluson] is first
   aorist active imperative, do it now and at once.

   23:19 Insurrection [stasin]. An old word for sedition, standing off,
   the very charge made against Jesus (and untrue). If Jesus had raised
   insurrection against Caesar, these accusers would have rallied to his
   standard. And for murder [kai phonon]. They cared nought for this. In
   fact, the murderer was counted a hero like bandits and gangsters today
   with some sentimentalists. Was cast [en bletheis]. Periphrastic aorist
   passive indicative of [ballO], a quite unusual form.

   23:21 But they shouted [hoi de epephOnoun]. Imperfect active of
   [epiphOneO], to call to. Old verb and a verb pertinent here. They kept
   on yelling. Crucify, crucify [staurou, staurou]. Present active
   imperative. Go on with the crucifixion. Mr 15:13 has [staurOson] (first
   aorist active imperative), do it now and be done with it. No doubt some
   shouted one form, some another.

   23:22 Why, what evil? [Ti gar kakon;]. Note this use of [gar]
   (explanatory and argumentative combined).

   23:23 But they were instant [hoi de epekeinto]. Imperfect middle of
   [epikeimai], an old verb for the rush and swirl of a tempest. With loud
   voices [phOnais megalais]. Instrumental case. Poor Pilate was
   overwhelmed by this tornado. Prevailed [katischuon]. Imperfect active
   of [katischuO] (see Mt 16:18; Lu 21:36). The tempest Pilate had invited
   (23:13).

   23:24 Gave sentence [epekrinen]. Pronounced the final sentence. The
   usual verb for the final decision. Only here in the N.T.

   23:25 Whom they asked for [hon eitounto]. Imperfect middle, for whom
   they had been asking for themselves. Luke repeats that Barabbas was in
   prison "for insurrection and murder." To their will [tOi thelemati
   autOn]. This is mob law by the judge who surrenders his own power and
   justice to the clamour of the crowd.

   23:26 They laid hold [epilabomenoi]. Second aorist middle participle of
   the common verb [epilambanO]. The soldiers had no scruples about taking
   hold of any one of themselves (middle voice). Mr 15:21; Lu 27:32 use
   the technical word for this process [aggareuO], which see for
   discussion and also about Cyrene. Laid on him [epethekan]. [K] first
   aorist of [epitithemi]. To bear it [pherein]. Present infinitive, to go
   on bearing.

   23:27 Followed [ekolouthei]. Imperfect active, was following. Verses
   27-32 are peculiar to Luke. Bewailed [ekoptonto]. Imperfect middle of
   [koptO], to cut, smite, old and common verb. Direct middle, they were
   smiting themselves on the breast. "In the Gospels there is no instance
   of a woman being hostile to Christ" (Plummer). Luke's Gospel is
   appropriately called the Gospel of Womanhood (1:39-56; 2:36-38;
   7:11-15, 37-50; 8:1-3; 10:38-42; 11:27; 13:11-16). Lamented
   [ethrenoun]. Imperfect active of [threneO], old verb from [threomai],
   to cry aloud, lament.

   23:28 Turning [strapheis]. Luke is fond of this second aorist passive
   participle of [strephO] (7:9, 44, 55; 10:23). If he had been still
   carrying the Cross, he could not have made this dramatic gesture. Weep
   not [me klaiete]. Present active imperative with [me], Stop weeping.

   23:29 Blessed [makariai]. A beatitude to the barren, the opposite of
   the hopes of Jewish mothers. Childless women are commiserated (1:25,
   36). To the hills [tois bounois]. A Cyrenaic word. In the N.T. only
   here and 3:5. Quotation from Ho 10:8.

   23:31 In the green tree [en hugrOi xulOi]. Green wood is hard to burn
   and so is used for the innocent. In the dry [en tOi xerOi]. Dry wood
   kindles easily and is a symbol for the guilty. This common proverb has
   various applications. Here the point is that if they can put Jesus to
   death, being who he is, what will happen to Jerusalem when its day of
   judgment comes? What shall be done [ti genetai]. Deliberative
   subjunctive.

   23:32 Were led (egonto). Imperfect passive of [agO], were being led.
   Malefactors [kakourgoi]. Evil [kakon], doers (work, [ergon]. Old word,
   but in the N.T. only in this passage (32, 33, 39) and 2Ti 2:9. Luke
   does not call them "robbers" like Mr 15:27; Mt 27:38,44. To be put to
   death [anairethenai]. First aorist passive infinitive of [anaireO], old
   verb, to take up, to take away, to kill.

   23:33 The skull [to kranion]. Probably because it looked like a skull.
   See on Mt 27:33; Mr 15:22. There they crucified him [ekei estaurOsan].
   There between the two robbers and on the very cross on which Barabbas,
   the leader of the robber band, was to have been crucified. One [hon
   men], the other [hon de]. Common idiom of contrast with this old
   demonstrative [hos] and [men] and [de].

   23:34 Father forgive them [Pater, aphes autois]. Second aorist active
   imperative of [aphiemi], with dative case. Some of the oldest and best
   documents do not contain this verse, and yet, while it is not certain
   that it is a part of Luke's Gospel, it is certain that Jesus spoke
   these words, for they are utterly unlike any one else. Jesus evidently
   is praying for the Roman soldiers, who were only obeying, but not for
   the Sanhedrin. Cast lots [ebalon kleron]. Second aorist active
   indicative of [ballO]. See Mr 15:24; Mt 27:35. Joh 19:23f. shows how
   the lot was cast for the seamless garment, the four soldiers dividing
   the other garments.

   23:35 The people stood beholding [histekei]. Past perfect active of
   [histemi], intransitive and like imperfect. A graphic picture of the
   dazed multitude, some of whom may have been in the Triumphal Entry on
   Sunday morning. Scoffed [exemukterizon]. Imperfect active, perhaps
   inchoative, began to turn up (out, [ex] at the dying Christ. The
   language comes from Ps 22:7. The Christ of God [ho Christos tou theou].
   He had claimed to be just this (22:67, 70). The sarcastic sneer (he
   saved others; let him save others, for himself he cannot save) is in Mr
   15:31; Mt 27:42. Luke alone gives the contemptuous use of [houtos]
   (this fellow) and the fling in "the elect" [ho eklektos]. These rulers
   were having their day at last.

   23:36 Mocked [enepaixan]. Even the soldiers yielded to the spell and
   acted like boys in their jeers. Aorist tense here and different verb
   also from that used of the rulers. They were not so bitter and
   persistent.

   23:37 If [ei]. Condition of the first class as is text in verse 35 used
   by the rulers. The soldiers pick out "the king of the Jews" as the
   point of their sneer, the point on which Jesus was condemned. But both
   soldiers and rulers fail to understand that Jesus could not save
   himself if he was to save others.

   23:38 A superscription [epigraphe]. Mr 15:26 has "the superscription of
   his accusation" Mt 27:37, "his accusation," Joh 19:19 "a title." But
   they all refer to the charge written at the top on the cross giving, as
   was the custom, the accusation on which the criminal was condemned,
   with his name and residence. Put all the reports together and we have:
   This is Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews. This full title
   appeared in Latin for law, in Aramaic for the Jews, in Greek for
   everybody (Joh 19:20).

   23:39 Railed [eblasphemei]. Imperfect active, implying that he kept it
   up. His question formally calls for an affirmative answer [ouchi], but
   the ridicule is in his own answer: "Save thyself and us." It was on a
   level with an effort to break prison. Luke alone gives this incident
   (39-43), though Mr 15:32; Mt 27:44 allude to it.

   23:40 Rebuking [epitimOn]. From what Mark and Matthew say both robbers
   sneered at Jesus at first, but this one came to himself and turned on
   his fellow robber in a rage. Dost thou not even fear God? [Oude phobei
   ton theon;]. [Oude] here goes with the verb. [Phobei] (second person
   singular present indicative middle of [phobeomai]. Both of you will
   soon appear before God. Jesus has nothing to answer for and you have
   added this to your other sins.)

   23:41 Nothing amiss [ouden atopon]. Nothing out of place [a] privative,
   [topos], place). Old word, three times in the N.T. (Lu 23:44; Ac 28:6;
   2Th 3:2). This can only mean that this robber accepts the claims of
   Jesus to be true. He is dying for claiming to be Messiah, as he is.

   23:42 In thy kingdom [eis ten basileian sou], text of Westcott and Hort
   or [en tei basileiai sou], margin). Probably no difference in sense is
   to be found, for [eis] and [en] are essentially the same preposition.
   He refers to the Messianic rule of Jesus and begs that Jesus will
   remember him. It is not clear whether he hopes for immediate blessing
   or only at the judgment.

   23:43 Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise [Semeron met' emou esei
   en tOi paradeisOi]. However crude may have been the robber's Messianic
   ideas Jesus clears the path for him. He promises him immediate and
   conscious fellowship after death with Christ in Paradise which is a
   Persian word and is used here not for any supposed intermediate state;
   but the very bliss of heaven itself. This Persian word was used for an
   enclosed park or pleasure ground (so Xenophon). The word occurs in two
   other passages in the N.T. (2Co 12:4; Re 2:7), in both of which the
   reference is plainly to heaven. Some Jews did use the word for the
   abode of the pious dead till the resurrection, interpreting "Abraham's
   bosom" (Lu 16:22f.) in this sense also. But the evidence for such an
   intermediate state is too weak to warrant belief in it.

   23:45 The sun's light failing [tou heliou ekleipontos]. Genitive
   absolute of the present active participle of [ekleipO], an old verb, to
   leave out, omit, pass by, to fail, to die. The word was used also of
   the eclipse of the sun or moon. But this was impossible at this time
   because the moon was full at the passover. Hence many documents change
   this correct text to "the sun was darkened" [eskotisthe ho helios] to
   obviate the difficulty about the technical eclipse. But the sun can be
   darkened in other ways. In a London fog at noon the street lights are
   often turned on. The Revised Version translates it correctly, "the
   sun's light failing." Leave the darkness unexplained. In the midst
   [meson]. In the middle. Mr 15:38; Mt 27:51 have "in two" [eis duo].

   23:46 Father [Pater]. Jesus dies with the words of Ps 31:5 on his lips.
   Gave up the ghost [exepneusen]. First aorist active indicative of
   [ekpneO], to breathe out, to expire, old word, but in the N.T. only
   here and Mr 15:37,39. There is no special reason for retaining "ghost"
   in the English as both Mt 27:50 (yielded up his spirit, [apheken to
   pneuma] and Joh 19:30 (gave up his spirit, [paredOken to pneuma] use
   [pneuma] which is the root of [ekpneO], the verb in Mark and Luke.

   23:47 Glorified [edoxazen]. Imperfect active. Began to glorify
   (inchoative) or kept on glorifying.

   23:48 Certainly [ontOs]. Really, old adverb from the participle [on]
   from [eimi], to be. Used also in 24:34 of the resurrection of Jesus. A
   righteous man [dikaios]. Mr 15:39 (Mt 27:54) which see, represents the
   centurion as saying [theou huios] (God's Son) which may mean to him
   little more than "righteous man." That came together
   [sunparagenomenoi]. Double compound [sun], together, [para], along),
   that came along together. To this sight [epi ten theOrian tauten]. This
   spectacle [theOrian] from [theOreO], verse 35). Returned
   [hupestrephon]. Imperfect active of [hupostrephO]. See them slowly
   wending their way back to the city from this Tragedy of the Ages which
   they had witnessed in awe.

   23:49 Stood afar off [histekeisan apo makrothen]. Same verb as in verse
   35. Melancholy picture of the inner circle of the acquaintances of
   Jesus and the faithful band of women from Galilee. Seeing these things
   [horOsai tauta]. And helpless either to prevent them or to understand
   them. They could only stand and look with blinded eyes.

   23:51 He had not consented to their counsel and deed [houtos ouk en
   sunkatatetheimenos tei boulei kai tei praxei autOn]. This parenthesis
   is given by Luke alone and explains that, though a councillor
   [bouleutes], Mr 5:43) he had not agreed to the vote of the Sanhedrin.
   It is fairly certain that both Joseph and Nicodemus were suspected of
   sympathy with Jesus and so were not invited to the trial of Jesus. Was
   looking for [prosedecheto]. Imperfect middle. Mr 15:43 has the
   periphrastic imperfect [en prosdechomenos].

   23:52 Asked for [eitesato]. First aorist middle (indirect) indicative
   as in Mr 15:43; Mt 27:58. The middle voice shows that Joseph of
   Arimathea asked the body of Jesus as a personal favour.

   23:53 Took it down [kathelOn]. Second aorist active participle of
   [kathaireO] as in Mr 15:46. Wrapped [enetulixen], as in Mt 27:59 where
   Mr 15:46 has [eneilesen] (wound), which see. Joh 19:40 has "bound"
   [edesan]. See Matt. and Mark also for the linen cloth [sindoni]. Hewn
   in stone [laxeutOi]. From [laxeuO] [las], a stone, [xeO], to polish).
   In the LXX and here only in the N.T. Nowhere else so far as known. See
   the usual Greek verb [latomeO] in Mr 15:46; Mt 27:60). Where never man
   had yet lain [hou ouk en oudeis oupO keimenos]. Triple negative and
   periphrastic past perfect passive in sense [keimai], though
   periphrastic imperfect passive in form. Same item in Joh 19:40 who uses
   [en tetheimenos] (periphrastic past perfect passive in form).

   23:54 The day of the Preparation [hemera paraskeues]. The technical
   Jewish phrase for the day before the sabbath for which see discussion
   on Mt 27:62. Drew on [epephOsken]. Imperfect active, began to dawn or
   give light. However, it was sundown, not sunrise when the Jewish
   sabbath (twenty-four-hour day) began. The confusion is to us, not to
   the Jews or the readers of the Greek New Testament. Luke is not
   speaking of the twelve-hour day which began with sunrise, but the
   twenty-four-hour day which began with sunset.

   23:55 Had come with him [esan suneleluthuiai]. Periphrastic past
   perfect active of [sunerchomai]. Followed after [katakolouthesasai].
   Aorist active participle of [katakoloutheO], an old verb, but in the
   N.T. only here and Ac 16:17. It is possible that they followed after
   Joseph and Nicodemus so that they "beheld the tomb," [etheasanto to
   mnemeion], and also "how his body was laid" [hOs etethe to sOma autou].
   First aorist passive indicative of [tithemi]. They may in fact, have
   witnessed the silent burial from a distance. The Syriac Sinaitic and
   the Syriac Curetonian give it thus: "and the women, who came with Him
   from Galilee went to the sepulchre in their footsteps, and saw the body
   when they had brought it in there." At any rate the women saw "that"
   and "how" the body of Jesus was laid in this new tomb of Joseph in the
   rocks.

   23:56 On the sabbath they rested [to sabbaton hesuchasan]. They
   returned and prepared spices before the sabbath began. Then they rested
   all during the sabbath (accusative of extent of time, [to sabbaton].
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 24

   24:1 At early dawn [orthrou batheos]. Genitive of time. Literally, at
   deep dawn. The adjective [bathus] (deep) was often used of time. This
   very idiom occurs in Aristophanes, Plato, et cetera. Joh 20:1 adds
   "while it was yet dark." That is, when they started, for the sun was
   risen when they arrived (Mr 16:2). Which they had prepared [ha
   hetoimasan]. Mr 16:1 notes that they bought other spices after the
   sabbath was over besides those which they already had (Lu 23:56).

   24:2 Rolled away [apokekulismenon]. Perfect passive participle of
   [apokuliO], late verb and in the N.T. only in this context (Mr 16:3; Mt
   28:2) while Joh 20:1 has [ermenon] (taken away).

   24:3 Of the Lord Jesus [tou kuriou Iesou]. The Western family of
   documents does not have these words and Westcott and Hort bracket them
   as Western non-interpolations. There are numerous instances of this
   shorter Western text in this chapter. For a discussion of the subject
   see my Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament, pp.
   225-237. This precise combination (the Lord Jesus) is common in the
   Acts, but nowhere else in the Gospels.

   24:4 While they were perplexed thereabout [en tOi aporeisthai autas
   peri toutou]. Luke's common Hebraistic idiom, [en] with the articular
   infinitive (present passive [aporeisthai] from [aporeO], to lose one's
   way) and the accusative of general reference. Two men [andres duo].
   Men, not women. Mr 16:5 speaks of a young man [neaniskon] while Mt 28:5
   has "an angel." We need not try to reconcile these varying accounts
   which agree in the main thing. The angel looked like a man and some
   remembered two. In verse 23 Cleopas and his companion call them
   "angels." Stood by [epestesan]. Second aorist active indicative of
   [ephistemi]. This common verb usually means to step up suddenly, to
   burst upon one. In dazzling apparel [en estheti astraptousei]. This is
   the correct text. This common simplex verb occurs only twice in the
   N.T., here and Lu 17:24 (the Transfiguration). It has the same root as
   [astrape] (lightning). The "men" had the garments of "angels."

   24:5 As they were affrighted [emphobOn genomenOn autOn]. Genitive
   absolute with second aorist middle of [ginomai], to become. Hence, when
   they became affrighted. They had utterly forgotten the prediction of
   Jesus that he would rise on the third day.

   24:6 He is not here, but is risen [ouk estin hOde, alla egerthe].
   Another Western non-interpolation according to Westcott and Hort. The
   words are genuine at any rate in Mr 16:6; Mt 28:7. The third day rise
   again [tei tritei hemerai anastenai]. See 9:22; 18:32, 33 where Jesus
   plainly foretold this fact. And yet they had forgotten it, for it ran
   counter to all their ideas and hopes.

   24:9 From the tomb [apo tou mnemeiou]. Some documents omit these words.
   This word for tomb is like our "memorial" from [mimneskO], to remind.
   Told [apeggeilan]. It was a wonderful proclamation. Luke does not
   separate the story of Mary Magdalene from that of the other women as
   John does (Joh 20:2-18).

   24:11 As idle talk [hOs leros]. Old word for nonsense, only here in the
   N.T. Medical writers used it for the wild talk of those in delirium or
   hysteria. Disbelieved (epistoun). Imperfect active of [apisteO], old
   verb from [apistos], without confidence or faith in. They kept on
   distrusting the story of the women.

   24:12 This entire 9 is a Western non-interpolation. This incident is
   given in complete form in Joh 18:2-10 and most of the words in this 9
   are there also. It is of a piece with many items in this chapter about
   which it is not easy to reach a final conclusion. Stooping and looking
   in [parakupsas]. First aorist active participle of [parakuptO], to
   stoop besides and peer into. Old verb used also in Joh 20:5,11; Jas
   1:25; 1Pe 1:12. By themselves [mona]. Without the body. To his home
   [pros hauton]. Literally, "to himself."

   24:13 Were going [esan poreuomenoi]. Periphrastic imperfect middle of
   [poreuomai]. Sixty stadia [stadious hexekonta]. About seven miles.

   24:14 They communed [hOmiloun]. Imperfect active of [homileO], old and
   common verb (from [homilos], in company with). In the N.T. only here
   (and verse 15) and Ac 20:11; 24:26. Our word homiletics is derived from
   this word for preaching was at first largely conversational in style
   and not declamatory.

   24:15 While they communed and questioned together [en tOi homilein
   autous kai sunzetein]. Same idiom as in verse 14, which see. Note
   [sunzetein]; each questioned the other. Jesus himself [autos Iesous].
   In actual person. Went with them [suneporeueto autois]. Imperfect
   middle, was going along with them.

   24:16 Were holden that they should not know him [ekratounto tou me
   epignOnai auton]. Imperfect passive of [krateO], continued being held,
   with the ablative case of the articular infinitive, "from recognizing
   him," from knowing him fully [epi-gnOnai], ingressive aorist of
   [epiginOsko]. The [me] is a redundant negative after the negative idea
   in [ekratounto].

   24:17 That you have with another [hous antiballete pros allelous].
   [Anti-ballO] is an old verb and means to throw in turn, back and forth
   like a ball, from one to another, a beautiful picture of conversation
   as a game of words. Only here in the N.T. They stood still
   [estathesan]. First aorist passive of [histemi], intransitive. They
   stopped. Looking sad [skuthrOpoi]. This is the correct text. It is an
   old adjective from [skuthros], gloomy and [ops], countenance. Only here
   in the N.T.

   24:18 Dost thou alone sojourn? [su monos paroikeis;]. [Monos] is
   predicate adjective. "Hast thou been dwelling alone (all by thyself)?"
   And not know? [kai ouk egnOs;]. Second aorist active indicative and
   difficult to put into English as the aorist often is. The verb
   [paroikeO] means to dwell beside one, then as a stranger like
   [paroikoi] (Eph 2:19). In Jerusalem everybody was talking about Jesus.

   24:21 But we hoped [hemeis de elpizomen]. Imperfect active, we were
   hoping. Note emphasis in [hemeis] (we). Redeem [lutrousthai]. From the
   bondage of Rome, no doubt. Yea and beside all this [alla ge kai sun
   pasin toutois]. Particles pile up to express their emotions. Yea [alla]
   here affirmative, as in verse 22, not adversative) at least [ge] also
   [kai] together with all these things [sun pasin toutois]. Like Pelion
   on Ossa with them in their perplexity. Now the third day [triten tauten
   hemeran agei]. A difficult idiom for the English. "One is keeping this
   a third day." And he is still dead and we are still without hope.

   24:22 Amazed us [exestesan hemas]. First aorist active (transitive)
   indicative with accusative [hemas] of [existemi]. The second aorist
   active is intransitive. Early [orthrinai]. A poetic and late form for
   [orthrios]. In the N.T. only here and Re 24:22. Predicate adjective
   agreeing with the women.

   24:23 Had seen [heOrakenai]. Perfect active infinitive in indirect
   assertion after [legousai]. Same construction for [zein] after
   [legousin]. But all this was too indirect and uncertain (women and
   angels) for Cleopas and his companion.

   24:25 Foolish men [anoetoi]. Literally without sense [nous], not
   understanding. Common word. Slow of heart [bradeis tei kardiai]. Slow
   in heart (locative case). Old word for one dull, slow to comprehend or
   to act. All that [pasin hois]. Relative attracted from the accusative
   [ha] to the case of the antecedent [pasin] (dative). They could only
   understand part of the prophecies, not all.

   24:26 Behooved it not? [ouchi edei;]. Was it not necessary? The very
   things about the death of Jesus that disturbed them so were the
   strongest proof that he was the Messiah of the Old Testament.

   24:27 Interpreted [diermeneusen]. First aorist active (constative
   aorist) indicative of [diermeneuO] (Margin has the imperfect
   [diermeneuen], intensive compound [dia] of [hermeneuO], the old verb to
   interpret from [hermeneus], interpreter, and that from [Hermes], the
   messenger of the gods as the people of Lystra took Paul to be (Ac
   14:12). But what wonderful exegesis the two disciples were now hearing!
   Concerning himself [peri heauton]. Jesus found himself in the Old
   Testament, a thing that some modern scholars do not seem able to do.

   24:28 Made as though [prosepoiesato]. First aorist active middle (Some
   MSS. have [prosepoieito] imperfect) indicative of [prospoieO], old verb
   to conform oneself to, to pretend. Only here in the N.T. Of course he
   would have gone on if the disciples had not urged him to stay.

   24:29 Constrained [parebiasanto]. Strong verb [parabiazomai], to compel
   by use of force (Polybius and LXX). In the N.T. only here and Ac 16:15.
   It was here compulsion of courteous words. Is far spent [kekliken].
   Perfect active indicative of [klinO]. The day "has turned" toward
   setting.

   24:30 When he had sat down [en tOi kataklithenai auton]. Luke's common
   idiom as in verses 4, 15. Note first aorist passive infinitive (on the
   reclining as to him). Gave [epedidou]. Imperfect, inchoative idea,
   began to give to them, in contrast with the preceding aorist
   (punctiliar) participles.

   24:31 Were opened [dienoichthesan]. Ingressive first aorist passive
   indicative of [dianoigO]. Knew [epegnOsan]. Effective first aorist
   active indicative fully recognized him. Same word in verse 16. Vanished
   [aphantos egeneto]. Became invisible or unmanifested. [Aphantos] from
   [a] privative and [phainomai], to appear. Old word, only here in the
   N.T.

   24:32 Was not our heart burning? [Ouchi he kardia hemOn kaiomene en;].
   Periphrastic imperfect middle. Spake [elalei]. Imperfect active, was
   speaking. This common verb [laleO] is onomatopoetic, to utter a sound,
   [la-la] and was used of birds, children chattering, and then for
   conversation, for preaching, for any public speech. Opened [dienoigen].
   Imperfect active indicative of the same verb used of the eyes in verse
   31.

   24:33 That very hour [autei tei hOrai]. Locative case and common Lukan
   idiom, at the hour itself. They could not wait. Gathered
   [ethroismenous]. Perfect passive participle of [athroizO], old verb
   from [athroos] (copulative [a] and [throos], crowd). Only here in the
   N.T.

   24:34 Saying [legontas]. Accusative present active participle agreeing
   with "the eleven and those with them" in verse 33. Indeed [ontOs].
   Really, because "he has appeared to Simon" [Opthe SimOni]. First aorist
   passive indicative of [horaO]. This is the crucial evidence that turned
   the scales with the disciples and explains "indeed." Paul also mentions
   it (1Co 15:5).

   24:35 Rehearsed [exegounto]. Imperfect middle indicative of
   [exegeomai], verb to lead out, to rehearse. Our word exegesis comes
   from this verb. Their story was now confirmatory, not revolutionary.
   The women were right then after all. Of them [autois]. To them, dative
   case. They did not recognize Jesus in his exegesis, but did in the
   breaking of bread. One is reminded of that saying in the Logia of
   Jesus: "Raise the stone and there thou shalt find me, cleave the wood
   and there am I."

   24:36 He himself stood [autos este]. He himself stepped and stood. Some
   documents do not have "Peace be unto you."

   24:37 Terrified [ptoethentes]. First aorist passive participle of
   [ptoeO], old verb and in the N.T. only here and Lu 21:9 which see.
   Affrighted [emphoboi genomenoi]. Late adjective from [en] and [phobos]
   (fear). Both these terms of fear are strong. Supposed [edokoun].
   Imperfect active of [dokeO], kept on thinking so.

   24:38 Why are ye troubled? [ti tetaragmenoi este;]. Periphrastic
   perfect passive indicative of [tarassO], old verb, to agitate, to stir
   up, to get excited.

   24:39 Myself [autos]. Jesus is patient with his proof. They were
   convinced before he came into the room, but that psychological shock
   had unnerved them all. Handle [pselaphesate]. This very word is used in
   1Jo 1:1 as proof of the actual human body of Jesus. It is an old verb
   for touching with the hand. Flesh and bones [sarka kai ostea]. At least
   this proves that he is not just a ghost and that Jesus had a real human
   body against the Docetic Gnostics who denied it. But clearly we are not
   to understand that our resurrection bodies will have "flesh and bones."
   Jesus was in a transition state and had not yet been glorified. The
   mystery remains unsolved, but it was proof to the disciples of the
   identity of the Risen Christ with Jesus of Nazareth.

   24:40 Another Western non-interpolation according to Westcott and Hort.
   It is genuine in Joh 20:20).

   24:41 Disbelieved for joy [apistountOn autOn apo tes charas]. Genitive
   absolute and a quite understandable attitude. They were slowly
   reconvinced, but it was after all too good to be true. Anything to eat
   [brOsimon]. Only here in the N.T., though an old word from [bibrOskO],
   to eat.

   24:42 A piece of broiled fish [ichthuos optou meros]. [Optos] is a
   verbal from [optaO], to cook, to roast, to broil. Common word, but only
   here in the N.T. The best old documents omit "and a honeycomb" [kai apo
   melissiou keriou].

   24:44 While I was yet with you [eti On sun humin]. Literally, Being yet
   with you. The participle [On] takes the time of the principal verb.

   24:45 Opened he their mind [dienoixen autOn ton noun]. The same verb as
   that in verses 31, 32 about the eyes and the Scriptures. Jesus had all
   these years been trying to open their minds that they might understand
   the Scriptures about the Messiah and now at last he makes one more
   effort in the light of the Cross and the Resurrection. They can now see
   better the will and way of God, but they will still need the power of
   the Holy Spirit before they will fully know the mind of Christ.

   24:46 It is written [gegraptai]. Perfect passive indicative of
   [graphO], to write, the usual phrase for quoting Scripture. Jesus now
   finds in the Old Testament his suffering, his resurrection, and the
   preaching of repentance and forgiveness of sins to all nations. Note
   the infinitives [pathein, anastenai, keruchthenai].

   24:47 Beginning [arxamenoi]. Aorist middle participle of [archO], but
   the nominative plural with no syntactical connection (an anacoluthon).

   24:49 Until ye be clothed [heOs hou endusesthe]. First aorist middle
   subjunctive of [enduO] or [endunO]. It is an old verb for putting on a
   garment. It is here the indirect middle, put on yourselves power from
   on high as a garment. They are to wait till this experience comes to
   them. This is "the promise of the Father." It is an old metaphor in
   Homer, Aristophanes, Plutarch, and Paul uses it often.

   24:50 Over against Bethany [heOs pros Bethanian]. That is on Olivet. On
   this blessed spot near where he had delivered the great Eschatological
   Discourse he could see Bethany and Jerusalem.

   24:51 He parted from them [dieste ap' autOn]. Second aorist active
   (intransitive) indicative of [diistemi]. He stood apart [dia] and he
   was gone. Some manuscripts do not have the words "and was carried into
   heaven." But we know that Jesus was taken up into heaven on a cloud (Ac
   1:9).

   24:52 Worshipped him [proskunesantes auton]. Here again we have one of
   Westcott and Hort's Western non-interpolations that may be genuine or
   not. With great joy [meta charas megales]. Now that the Ascension has
   come they are no longer in despair. Joy becomes the note of victory as
   it is today. No other note can win victories for Christ. The bells rang
   in heaven to greet the return of Jesus there, but he set the carillon
   of joy to ringing on earth in human hearts in all lands and for all
   time.
