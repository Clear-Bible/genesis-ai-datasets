PREFACE
THE agreement to prepare the volumes on the Minor Prophets for this series was entered into in 1890,— fourteen years ago. I did not then anticipate the serious obligations which were shortly to be assumed in other directions. But in all these years of administrative concern I have had recourse for change, comfort, and courage to my work on the Twelve Prophets. A large portion of the work had been finished as early as 1897, when the essential results on the structure of Amos appeared in Zhe Biblical World. It is a significant fact that during these fourteen years there have been given to the world the noteworthy contributions of Oort (1890), Mitchell (1893; 1900), Miiller (1896), Cheyne (in W. R. Smith, Prophets’, 1895), Nowack (1897, 1903), George Adam Smith (1896), Volz (1897), Driver (1897), Wellhausen (3d ed., 1898), Budde (1899), Lohr (xg01), Sievers (1901), Baumann (1903), Meinhold (1903), and Marti (1903).
The plan originally included two volumes for the Minor Prophets; this has been enlarged to three, of which the pres- ent volume, containing Amos and Hosea, is the first. Vol. II. will include Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Obadiah ; Vol. III., Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Joel, Jonah. It is hoped that the second and third volumes will appear within the next two years.
It cannot be said that the Twelve Prophets lack, either in the comprehensive relation which they sustain to the entire history of Hebrew life and thought, in the interest of the prob- lems which they suggest, or in the almost infinite variety of these problems. In every field of study, the textual, the literary, the historical, the archaeological, and the theological, they fur- nish facts and suggest questions than which few others, perhaps, possess gredter significance. One need only mention, by way

of illustration, the questions involved in determining the place of Amos in the development of Hebrew thought, the problems of criticism and interpretation which are suggested by the early chapters of Hosea, the text and historical distribution of the chapters now joined together under the name of Micah, the complexity of the data included in the several portions of Zechariah, not to speak of the fragmentary character of Oba- diah, the peculiar phenomena presented in Jonah, and many other equally puzzling but significant aspects of literary and theological inquiry. These facts and problems connect them- selves with every important phase of the Old Testament activity between goo B.c. and 300 B.C., in other words, with the entire creative period.
The books which occupy our attention in this first volume go well together, not only because one follows the other chrono- logically, but also because one supplements the other logically, the two presenting a totality of expression in the light of which each receives a clearer interpretation. It seemed necessary to take up, in connection with these first two of the immortal Twelve, many questions that concern just as closely the others. Especially was the force of this point felt in the Introduction ; for an introduction to Amos and Hosea is really an introduction to Prophecy.
Nowhere is it more necessary to distinguish sharply between the actual words of an author and those that have been added by later writers than in the case of Amos and Hosea. The his- tory of the Messianic idea, in whatever sense we employ that term, is fundamentally involved in this distinction. Care has been taken, therefore, to keep separate the quite considerable proportion of material (ascribed by tradition to these authors) which may confidently be treated as of later origin. This in the case of Amos is about one-fifth of the whole, and in the case of Hosea about one-fourth.
It is unquestionably the first duty of a commentator to recon- struct the text as best he may. The contributions to the text- criticism of Amos and Hosea, made within two decades, are striking; but not more so than the unanimity with which the more important emendations have received acceptance. More-

over, many of the changes originally suggested, perhaps on one or another basis (e.g. grammar, history, the versions, or the strophic structure), have later received corroboration on other grounds than those on which they rested primarily. This has frequently occurred in my own experience ; and when I recall how often a twofold or even threefold substantiation of a con- jecture has thus taken place, I am compelled to defend myself, and others like myself, against Professor Driver’s suggestion that “it is precarious to base textual and critical inferences ”’ upon the “strophe.”* I venture to suggest that in the near future this comparatively new phase of critical study will be “brought forth into a large place.”{ It is worthy of notice surely that nearly every important piece of work on the Twelve Prophets in fifteen years has taken into consideration the ques- tion of the measure and strophic arrangement (pp. clxv f.). My own interest in this subject was aroused in 1887 by the articles of Professor Briggs in Hebraica. No one can doubt the good results in general which have followed the turning of attention in this direction. It is unnecessary, and in a com- mentary impossible, to take up this phase of treatment in all the detail worked out by Sievers; but it is equally impossible now to study the thought of these prophetic sermons without recognizing fully this fundamental factor in their form of com- position. As a matter of fact, “ strophic structure” is only another name for “ logical structure.”
The textual notes preceding the general treatment and the grammatical and philological notes following it have been in- tended to furnish the student of ordinary advancement the more important data with which to reach his own conclusions. I fear that in some cases these suggestions are too elementary in their character; but I have had in mind that student of Sacred Scripture who, with such help, might enter into a fairly critical appreciation of the points raised; and I have felt that I might advantageously omit a portion of this kind of material in the succeeding volumes. The presentation of different read- ings which are not accepted, as well as of all the principal

interpretations in every case, seemed to me to be required by the emphasis which the editors of the series have placed upon the importance of providing the history of the interpretation. I am perfectly aware that the history of interpretation does not consist in placing one after another a series of differing interpre- tations ; but it is quite clear that space would not permit a fuller discussion in every place, nor was such discussion necessary. At the same time, upon the basis of the interpretations as thus given, even when no comment is added, it is not difficult for one to construct the history. I have endeavored to note all Opinions really worthy of consideration; and I trust that the fulness of citation in some passages may not prove too weari- some to the reader who is not a student,
It is a source of great satisfaction to make acknowledgment of the indebtedness which I owe to those who have preceded me ; and especially to Baur, Wiinsche, Cheyne, Wellhausen, W. Rob- ertson Smith, Nowack, Driver, George Adam Smith, Budde, and Kautzsch (v. his article, “Religion of Israel,” in Hast- ings’s Dictionary of the Bible). 1 have tried in each important instance to indicate the position taken by those who have dis- cussed that particular case; and likewise to recognize the author who first suggested a reading or interpretation after- ward adopted by others. I regret that my manuscript was already almost wholly in type before the appearance of No- wack’s second edition and of Marti’s commentary. Use has been made of these volumes in the revision of the sheets. I ought perhaps to mention that a considerable portion of my manuscript has been thrown out because I had transgressed the limits set for the volume.
A word more concerning the Introduction seems to be neces- sary. It appeared to me that a brief summary of pre-prophetism was required as the basis on which to place the work of Amos and Hosea. This would have been unnecessary if it were cer- tain that all Hebrew thought really began with Amos. But this view I cannot accept, and so I have enlarged the Introduction to include a résumé of the pre-prophetic activity. In the pres- entation of this I have found myself greatly embarrassed for lack of space.
PREFACE xi
The list of literature will be found fairly exhaustive as far as half a century back. Lists of the literature before that time are accessible in Gunning’s De Godspraken van Amos, Driver’s article on Amos in Smith’s Dictionary of the Bible (2d ed.), Wiinsche’s Hosea, and in Lange’s Commentary, Vol. XVI. The reader is requested to note the Addenda and Corrigenda on pp. xv, xvi, as well as the abbreviations on pp. xvii ff.
In conclusion, I wish particularly to acknowledge the help which has been given me in the preparation of the volume by my former pupil, now my colleague, Dr. John M. P. Smith. The assistance which he has rendered in gathering material, in verifying references, and in revising the manuscript and the printer’s sheets, and the suggestions which he has made from time to time upon the subject-matter itself, have been of the greatest value. Without this help I doubt whether I should have been able to bring the work to a completion. My thanks are due also to my former pupil, Professor George R. Berry of Colgate University, for aid furnished, and to my colleague, Professor George S. Goodspeed, for important suggestions in connection with the historical material in Amos.
The publishers have codperated most generously in securing a typographical excellence which, I am confident, will be greatly appreciated.
I think that I realize most keenly some of the defects of this commentary. Doubtless many that I do not perceive will be pointed out to me. I shall hope to make good use of all such criticisms and suggestions in connection with the two remaining volumes.

INTRODUCTION.
A. FACTORS IN THE PRE-PROPHETIC MOVEMENT. § 1. THE PRE-PROPHETIC MOVEMENT IN GENERAL.
For a proper understanding of the place of Amos and Hosea in connection with Hebrew prophecy it is necessary to consider briefly the principal manifestations, during the two preceding cen- turies, of what may be called “ pre-prophetism” ;* the basis of this movement and its chief characteristics ; likewise its funda- mental thought (concerning God, man, worship, life, and the future), as wrought out in this period. In the same connec- tion some attention must be given to Assyria, which in these times touches Israel so closely and exercises so marked an in- fluence upon the development of Israelitish thought. { With some of the data relating to these subjects in our possession, we shall be better prepared to take up the subjects connected with Amos and Hosea, viz. in each case the personal life, the message, the public ministry ; likewise the literary form of the prophetic work,
 
* The distinction between prophetism proper (¢.e. written prophecy) and that out of which it sprang is important, and may be maintained by using for the latter the word “ pre-prophetism.” For the same reason, we may use nadhe’ (pl. mebhi’im) in speaking of those (not seevs) who preceded Amos. Cf. the use of the terms Nebtismus and Prophetismus by R. Kraetzschmar in Prophet und Seher im Alten Israel (1901).
+ In other words, the theology of these times, as it has been preserved in con- temporaneous writings and in tradition.
tA striking characteristic of Israel, in comparison with its sister nations, was a readiness to receive, from the outside, contributions in the form of new institutions and new thought. Much of this was bad and in time was lost; but much of it, being good, was retained. The gradual accumulation and assimilation of this outside material, under the guidance of an all-wise Providence, ultimately lifted Israel to a position of influence in world-history.

Xxxii INTRODUCTION
the versions in which it has come down to us, and the more important literature.*
The spirit of pre-prophetism was always alert and aggressive. Its manifes- tations were frequent, strong, and of a unique character. These manifesta- tions were factors in preparing the way for that “point in the history of prophecy at which this great religious phenomenon rises — apparently, but surely not really—on a sudden to a higher level” (Che. ZB. 3855); in other words, the point at which Amos and Hosea appear upon the scene of action. Unless a better explanation of the forward step taken at this time by the so-called writing prophets can be furnished than that which Budde (Fe/. 131) proposes (viz. their utter failure to impress the people by oral speech), the question is to be regarded as a problem still unsolved.
§ 2. PRE-PROPHETIC PARTICIPATION IN THE REVOLT OF JeRozoamM I.
The participation of the medhz’¢m in the revolt which resulted in the disruption of the united kingdom may be assumed, not- withstanding the late date of those portions of the narrative { in which this participation is especially described.
* Much is gained in thinking of Amos and Hosea as together presenting a single unit of thought; for, while each is in sharp contrast with the other in tempera- ment and in message, neither, by himself, is complete, They must both be taken to secure the whole idea,
+ Kue. (fed. I. 198 f.) says, ‘‘ The revolt of the ten tribes from the royal house of David was undoubtedly countenanced by the prophets, especially by those of Ephraim” ; We. (Prod. 458), declares that they “ actually suggested and promoted it”; Kit. (Hist. 11.188) says, “ Jeroboam was supported in his enterprise by a prophet, Ahijah of Shiloh”; Kent (/zs¢. II. 20) maintains that it was supported by prophets who selected the leader. So also Gu. (GV/. 130-132), Wade (0.7. Hist. 313), Paton (Ast. 191). Cf. Che. (#2. 2406), who, though treating the narratives as unhistorical, regards it as possible that Jeroboam had friendly relations with Ahijah who lived at Shiloh, and certain that the northern prophets were on Jero- boam’s side; and contra Winckler (G/. I. 159f., II. 273) and H. P. Smith (0.7. Hist. 1903, pp. 177-80), who make no reference to prophetic influence; Sta. (GV. I. 306f.), who declares the narratives concerning the prophets to be without historical basis.
{ There are four stories: (1) Ahijah, 1 K. 112940, of which vs.2931 may be early (so Kit. and Skinner) ; but all is considered late by WkI. ( Untersuch. 8 f.), Kamp- hausen, Benz., and Sta. (SBOT.) ; (2) Shemaiah, 1 K, 1222-4, clearly late; (3) “the man of God out of Judah” and ‘the old prophet at Bethel,” 1 K. 131-82, all of which is late; (4) the visit of Jeroboam’s wife to Ahijah, 1 K. 141-18, which, if early, has
been thoroughly worked over by a later editor, the Hebrew text seeming to be a late recension of ©,
PRE-PROPHETISM AND THE REVOLT OF JEROBOAM I. xxxiii
This assumption is based upon (1) the fact that the early prophets in their intense conservatism stand opposed to every advance of civilization; cf. the general policy of Elijah (p. xxxvi), the attitude of the Judean narrative toward the beginnings of civilization in Gn. 4!¢*4, and the opposition of Isaiah (26f 318) to everything that seemed to favor luxury in life; not to speak of the representation of this same idea by the Nazirites and Rechabites who were closely associated with edA2ism and prophetism (p. xxxi); (2) the probabil- ity that the spirit which later actuated Elijah (as well as Amos and especially Hosea) in reference to the acknowledgment of other gods existed, at least in germ, in the minds of these earlier nebhi’im (so eg. WRS. Proph. 48 ff. Bu. £el. 102); (3) the consistency of this pre-prophetic action with that of Elijah and Elisha in the conspiracy against the dynasty of Omri, as well as with the alleged conspiracy of Amos himself (Am. 710-13) against Jeroboam ILI., at which time the prophetic temper was at all events regarded as revolu- tionary; and (4) the extreme likelihood that the prophetic stories, while late, represent in the main a true tradition, since they, at least, indicate one school of later opinion, the other school, led by Hosea (cf. Ho. 84 13") regarding the revolt or schism as a great blunder.
The effect of the disruption, in so far as the pre-prophetic movement is concerned, appears (1) in the fact that this move- ment takes place in the North, rather than under the Davidic dynasty in the South,* for until the last twenty years or so before the end of the Northern kingdom (721 B.c.) Judah produced little or nothing except the Judean narrative (p. lxix). This was true in part, because (2) a much greater liberty existed in the North, as a consequence of the failure of the Solomonic régime to maintain in Israel the obligations which it succeeded in imposing upon Judah ; and with this liberty, there was possible also (3) a far greater simplicity of life than in the South; there existed, in fact, a more democratic atmosphere, the extreme class distinctions being less emphasized ;¢ while (4) there was less interference from outside influence than would have been felt under a con- tinuation of the Solomonic policy; likewise, (5) the disruption,
* Che. (ZB. 3863), after making the words “Gilgal,” ‘‘ Carmel,” ‘‘ Ephraim,” “Jordan,” “ Ramoth-gilead,” etc, (as they occur in the narrative), corruptions of the all-pervading Yerahmeel of North Arabia, and after assigning the homes of Elijah and Elisha, as well as of Amos, to this region, says, ‘‘ We cannot therefore be certain that there were any settlements of prophets in Northern Israel.”
+ Meinhold (p. 25) suggests that Yahweh was the champion of every Israelite against the despotism of Solomon, and that the zadfz’, therefore, as in later times the prophet, took the side of the deity against the despot,
XXXIV INTRODUCTION
in spite of the calves of Jeroboam, contributed very largely toward preparing the way for that ultimate separation of Yahweh from a place among the gods of the nations, and his elevation into the god of the heavens.* The revolt, in a word, was in some slight sense an anticipation of the later and more radical steps taken by Elijah and Elisha.
§ 3. THE PRE-PROPHETIC MANIFESTATION UNDER ELIJAH’S LEADERSHIP.
1. Prophetic interference in the affairs of state took place under Elijah’s leadership in the days of Ahab (ca. 875-850 B.C.). In estimating the importance of this very notable and unique manifestation of the pre-prophetic spirit, account must first be taken of the different strata of material preserved. On this point students are practically agreed.
Certain stories come from about 800 B.c., ze. from within fifty years or so of Elijah’s own times, vz. (a) the early trouble with Ahab and the drought ; the contest on Carmel; and the visit to Horeb (1 K. 17!-189% 8 1892b_1994-118-21); (5) the story of Naboth’s vineyard (1 K. 21}%2 27); (c) Elijah’s encounter with Ahaziah’s messengers (2 K. 1745), From a period twenty-five to fifty years later comes the account of Elijah’s last days with Elisha and his translation (2 K. 2-%). To a much later time belong the story of Elijah’s treatment of the companies sent out by Ahaziah (2 K. 1918) and certain additions to the early stories (eg. 1 K. 183? 431. 82@ yo9b-lla 219%. %6.28f; Benzinger makes 2 K. 15% also late, and Kamphausen the entire account, 2 K, 1-18), So substantially Kit., Benz., Kamphausen, Burney, and Skinner ; but Sta. (SBO7T.) calls all the Elijah and Elisha material late except 1 K, 1881-824 1992.10. M1a.c. 21200.21f% 2 K, 2la25d (cf, GVJ, I 522, note); Meinhold (pp. 17-21) places the stories about 750 B.c. on the ground that such legends could not have developed in fifty years ; and Todd (Politics and Religion in Ancient Isr. (1904), 195 ff.) minimizes Elijah’s significance and makes the entire Baal-story an allegory coming from Manasseh’s times.
2. In the interpretation of these stories, the earlier, as well as the later, must be acknowledged to show two tendencies of a decided character. The narrator’s point of view is one strongly biassed by the attitude toward Baalism which prevailed in the times succeeding
 
* Cf. K. DB. V. 646 f.
PRE-PROPHETISM UNDER ELIJAH’S LEADERSHIP xxxv
Jehu. The picture of Ahab and his relation to Baalism is greatly overdrawn, a very large legendary element having entered into it.* Besides this, Elijah, called xadfz’, or prophet, only once in the entire narrative (viz. 1 K. 18% where no other designation could have been employed), is everywhere (especially in 1 K. 17°“ 2 K, 1°” 2°) represented as possessed of magical powers.t
3- But after making full allowance for these elements, we may feel confident that Elijah represents a true historical character of a remarkable type, and that a proof of his greatness is this very “stupendous and superhuman” image of him here sketched. f{ We are not compelled to choose between the two extreme views, according to one of which, the prophet Elijah, while above the level of the xebhz’im of his time, is presented in greatly magnified form, the prophets of this period having had no such prominence as the narratives assign to them ; § while the other treats him as a Titanic character creating a new epoch in Israel’s history, to be placed side by side with Moses himself. || His proper place may be determined by observing certain secondary points in connec- tion with his contest with Ahab regarding Baalism, and with Ahab’s relations to Naboth, and all of this must be studied in the light of the issue of the whole matter as it appears in the case of Jehu under Elisha’s ministry.
Among other points, outside of the two main stories, the following should not be overlooked: (1) Elijah (ws.) is not called abhi’, because even at this time he is recognized as something different. He may not, however, be placed in the class of the writing prophets, because, unlike them, he has left

XXXVI INTRODUCTION
nothing in written form; and unlike them, he is closely associated with man- ticism and magic. On the other hand, the facts seem to make him both seer and abhi’. Witness the point already suggested in reference to manticism and magic, and, in addition, the fact of his close relationship with the societies of nebhi’im, and his apparent leadership among them, his farewell visit to the vari- ous headquarters of these societies, their strong interest in the occasion and the manner of his final departure; and, still further, those great characteristics of sturdiness, strength, and courage which bespeak for him a place side by side with the seers of the past, viz. Moses, Joshua, Samuel. (2) The sud- denness of his appearances and disappearances, so frequently a subject of comment (1 K. 17! 187 # 2 K. 2!6), is to be attributed to the /acunae of the narrative, rather than to any effort upon the part of the writer to cultivate an atmosphere of mystery.
(3) The impression of a magical personality (cf. the story of Samuel and the witch of Endor) is conveyed, not only in the miraculous power ascribed to him in general, but also in his special power over dew and rain (1 K. 172 181. 41-45), the deference paid to him by Obadiah (1 K. 187#-), the use of an extra quantity of water to prevent suspicion (183 #-), the physical performance in connection with his premonition of rain (184%), the ecstatic condition in which he ran five hours from Carmel to Jezreel (184), the magical power ascribed to his mantle (1919, cf. 2 K. 28-18), which Elisha may not resist, and with which the waters are divided; and especially in the account of his marvellous translation by means of a chariot and horses of fire (2K. 2!!*), a later expression of the feeling that his activity was enduring, and that his fellowship with God was “so close that its interruption seemed inconceiv- able” (K. D&. V. 655). In close connection with all this is (4) the strongly pronounced nomadic spirit, which, naturally, stands opposed to everything that indicates progress in civilization. This spirit appears in the simplicity of his food and dress (1 K. 198-18 2 K. 18), in his isolation from his fellows, and in his opposition to the religious policy of Ahab (v.z.). Perhaps this furnishes the explanation, also, of the sudden character of his appearances and disappearances (v.s.): it is surely in accord with this that he is repre- sented as living by the brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan (1 K. 177-7); sojourning outside of his own country at Zarephath in Phoenicia (1 K. 178); paying a visit to Horeb, after a journey of forty days and forty nights (1 K. 195%); and moving about from place to place (2 K. 1, 2); cf, the nomadic character of the Rechabites (p. lii), who arose about this time (v.z.). (5) Not a little light is thrown upon the story of pre-prophetism by the two incidents in Elijah’s life, in connection with which he left his native land and visited foreign countries. The earlier sojourn in Phoenicia, at Zarephath, together with the nature of the work performed, indicates, on his part, not only the nomadic tendency (in this case encouraged, doubtless, by fear of Ahab), but also an attitude toward non-Israelites which is broad and liberal, in spite of the narrow and intense zeal ordinarily attributed to him; and besides, a leniency which meant that the hatred shown in connection
PRE-PROPHETISM UNDER ELIJAH’S LEADERSHIP XXXVil
with Baalism was not against that religion in itself, but only against its encroachment upon the realm of Yahweh (Sm. Rel? 178; Co. Proph, 31), who had now become recognized as, indeed, the god of the land of Israel, although not god also of Phoenicia. The visit to Horeb (1 K. 19° #), while illustrative of many elements in the prophet’s character (e.g. the longing for solitude characteristic of the nomad, and a deep spiritual nature, as well as a tendency to deep despondency), also calls attention to the prophet’s idea of Yahweh’s original home and dwelling-place, z.e. the place in which one can most easily secure his oracle; and is better understood in the light of Ju. 5° (cf. also Dt. 33? Hb. 3 Ps. 688). This journey, although undertaken in a fit of discouragement, and because of Jezebel’s inimical attitude, cannot be easily explained on any other supposition than that the af’, in accordance with the general conviction, makes this pilgrimage, in the fashion of all ages, to a place regarded as sacred from the oldest times, because there Yahweh had dwelt in the beginning (Bu. Re/. 18; K. DB. V. 626 f.; Barton, Semitec Origins, 277; Sta. GVZ, I. 130 ff.).
(6) The chief elements in certain situations described in the Elijah-stories had already been anticipated in earlier history, eg. Solomon had erected sanctuaries for his foreign wives (1 K. 117) just as Ahab does for Jezebel (v.i.), and probably this constituted one of the charges in the prophetic indictment of that monarch. Even earlier, Nathan had taken precisely the same stand against the abuse of royal power (2S. 12115) as that taken by Elijah in the case of Ahab. Still further, the thought of Yahweh’s using Syria (1 K. 19!-17) in order to punish Israel for wrong-doing, does not, of itself, imply that Yahweh is other than a national god, as is clear from the presence of this same conception not only in earlier Israelitish times (Nu. 14 f. [J, E] Jos. 7 [J]}, but also among other nations (cf. the part played by the gods in the fall of Babylon in the Cyrus Cylinder,* and the representa- tions concerning Yahweh’s power at the time of the Exodus [J, E], and in the confusion of tongues at Babel [in J]; cf. Meinhold, 30f.). On the further bearing of this, v.z. (7) Much turns upon the exact meaning assigned to the utterances concerning Yahweh and the Baalim in 1 K, 18% 27. 37.3% (Sm, Rel? 178), v.2.
4. The uncertainty of the facts in the story of Elijah’s struggle with Ahab and the priests of Baal explains, if it does not justify, the varying interpretations which have been founded upon them. We may consider here those points which relate to the form of
 
* The words of Sennacherib’s general (2 K. 1825 = Is. 3619) might also be cited, were it not probable that they represent a later Israelitish view rather than the thought of the Assyrian (cf. Sta., Benz., Marti, Duhm, éz /oc.). It is hardly likely that the haughty Assyrian would represent himself as acting in obedience to the command of the god of a small, despised people.
XXXVIli INTRODUCTION
the story, the actual facts as nearly as they can be determined, and the problems raised by these facts. But since Elijah’s contest is only part (or perhaps the beginning) of the great struggle which was closed, under the direction of Elisha, by Jehu, we shall state the problems and reserve a decision upon them until the additional help has been gained which is furnished by the events of Elisha’s career and a consideration of the actual denouement (pp. xlviii f.).
(1) Reference has been made to the date of the material (v.s.), as well as to its prejudiced character. We cannot fail to note also its fragmentary form, eg. its failure to furnish any introduction to the story of the challenge, from which an adequate knowledge of the events leading up to it may be obtained; the lack, also, of the end of the story, in which one might have expected to find out how Elijah executed the commission given him at Horeb, for surely 1 K. 19!9 20 cannot be accepted as a fitting conclusion; and, still further, the absence of anything that will throw light on the fulfilment of the prediction in 1 K.191”. Perhaps the story of Naboth was intended, as Wellhausen sug- gests, to be the beginning of the judgment which overtook the worshippers of Baal. (2) The facts in the story itself are not always mutually consistent, and the statement throughout bears evidence of being too strongly colored against Ahab. The formal charge in 1 K. 163088 represents him as being actually the greatest sinner that has yet occupied Israel’s throne. But every accusation made, except that of building an altar in the house of Baal (v.22), comes from the Deuteronomic period, nearly two and a half centuries later, when the official spirit had altogether changed. Was the extension of this courtesy to his wife worse than the similar act of Solomon? And then, we may not think that Ahab had altogether forsaken Yahweh, or that Yahwism was in so bad a state, when we learn that of Ahab’s children, three (1 K. 224 2K, 31 $18 %) were given names containing the word Yahweh as one element; that Ahab is able to find four hundred Yahweh prophets in one place, when there is occasion for their service (1 K. 22°); and that the number of those who had not bowed the knee to Baal was seven thousand, while, on the other hand, all of the Baal adherents are able a little later to be accommo- dated in one house (2 K, 107-23), If, now, we add to this the statement of Jehu that Ahab served Baal only a little (2 K. 1018), and the evidence that Jezebel was, indeed, a malicious and vindictive woman, we may well suppose not only that the situation was less serious than it is represented, but also that Jezebel, rather than Ahab, was the chief sinner. Ahab, follow- ing the policy of David and Solomon, sought to strengthen his throne and benefit the nation by alliance with outside powers, and did not appreciate the full meaning of the struggle as it presented itself to Elijah. He regarded the question as one in which the royal authority was involved, and, encouraged doubtless by the Tyrian influence, acted accordingly (WRS. Proph. 76 ff.). But, on the other hand, Jezebel was zealous and persistent in her efforts to
PRE-PROPHETISM UNDER ELIJAH’S LEADERSHIP xxxix
build up the Baal-party, for political as well as for religious purposes. The Tyrian Baal-worship threatened to a greater or less degree the Israelitish Yahweh-worship. (3) But these facts, even in this simpler and less sensational form, represent a contest. What was the point at issue ?
The question, in general, is this: Does Elijah here draw the line between the spiritual Israel (z.e. the seven thousand), and Israel of the flesh, who, though of the nation, are not members of the elect, known later as “the remnant” ?* Are the spiritual and the worldly here for the first time brought into conflict ?{ Does Elijah, then, give evidence of a conception of God higher than any that has yet been held? Or, on the other hand, shall we throw out this entire narrative of the Baal-struggle as absolutely unhistorical;{ and understanding that it had its origin a century or a century and a half later than was indicated above, regard it as consequently the expression of a time not earlier than that of Amos and Hosea ? In either case may we suppose that, after all, Elijah’s position is nothing more than Ahijah might have taken against Solomon, the fact being that the struggle is on behalf of the old idea, viz. an undefiled cultus, through a correct performance of which Yahweh’s demands are satisfied, § and not in behalf of the new idea, empha- sized by the writing prophets, that Yahweh’s religion was something other than a cult? Does Elijah represent Yahweh as about to bring great punishment on Israel, through Syria, because of failure to observe a pure cult, or because of ethical shortcomings ? This is the question at issue. The answer to it is of great con- cern in determining the value of the contribution of Amos and Hosea.
5. The Naboth story is perhaps more significant than anything else connected with the life of Elijah, for here there is spoken the condemnation of governmental unrighteousness which receives so large a notice from later prophets.
Some difficulties exist, likewise, in the form, as it is given us, of this story (1 K. 21). It is easy to see that it interrupts the connection of chaps. 20 and 22. If to this we add that in @ it immediately follows chap. 19, and that it has many points of affinity with the narrative in chaps. 17, 19 (eg. the

xl INTRODUCTION
representation of Ahab as a weak man controlled by Jezebel; also the appar- ent dependence of 21204 upon 1817), sustaining no relation to chaps. 20, 22, we have a fairly strong case for the order given in @ (v.s.). But now, if we put together the fact that Elijah is being introduced again by the same writer after his successor has been appointed (1 K. 191); the fact that the murder of Naboth contributed more largely to the ruin of Ahab’s house than did his religious policy (Ew. Hist. IV. 71,107; Co. Proph. 31 ff.; Skinner, 255); and the better understanding gained of the Carmel episode if we suppose the murder of Naboth to have preceded it, and to have excited the feeling of the people against Ahab (Skinner, 255; WRS. ZB. 2670), — we are compelled to assume either that chap. 21 originally stood between vs.}8#"419 of chap. 19, or that it is an independent document (cf. its resemblance to 14!""6, and the view of Burney that it belongs to the same source as 2 K. 91-1078) ,*
Keeping in mind the difficulties which the form of the story presents, we may note in reference to its content: (a) that the main point, rebuke of the king for an outrageous act, is the same as that found in the Nathan-David story (v.s.), and forms one of the principal topics in the discourses of Amos and Hosea ; (4) that, after all, Ahab’s act was not an unusual thing for an oriental monarch (v.s.) ; but, in this case, the ancient spirit of freedom is again aroused (as in the days of the disruption) against a personal despotism ; (c) that it was this crime (v.s.), rather than Ahab’s defence of Baalism, that cost him his throne, a significant fact in the history of national ethics and of a true conception of religion. In this same connection we may observe further: (@) the thing which Yahweh is here represented as doing is something quite unusual; the threat that Ahab’s house is to be destroyed by a foreign power, viz. Syria, plainly makes Yahweh something other than a merely national god (v.z.) ; (4) the Naboth-story is to receive practically the same interpretation, whether we suppose it
* To this may still be added the lack of harmony between chap. 21 and 2 K. 9; cf. the position of Naboth’s “field” in 2 K. 9l6f., a little way from Jezreel, and Naboth’s “vineyard” close to Ahab’s palace (in Samaria?), 1 K. 2118, and the variants of @ in v.1; the visit of Ahab to his ill-gotten prize on the day after the murder in 2 K.9%6, but apparently on the same day in 1 K. 21; also, the words of Jehu in 2 K. 96 tell us a fact not in 1 K. 21-16, viz, that Naboth’s sons were killed. On the basis of these and other facts chap. 21 is assigned to an independent source, as an appendix to chaps, 17-1921, by Kue. Zzné. III. 78; Meinhold, 12ff.; Gunkel, Preussische Fahrb. XXVII. (1897), 18 ff.; Skinner; but cf. We. Hex. 283 ff.; WRS., art. ‘‘ Kings,” #2. 2670; Kit. 159-162; Benz. in loc,

to have preceded the Carmel event, and to be closely connected therewith (furnishing, in fact, the basis of that popular uprising), or to have followed it and been entirely independent of it. In either case it is a cry for justice to those oppressed. Upon the whole, something tangible is gained if the two stories are joined together ; (c) with both stories there may be connected logically the opening message of Elijah to Ahab (1 K. 171) containing the threat of drought ; for, after all, this is the question at issue ; Who grants ran? Who is God? Yahweh or Baal? The chief purpose of this threat was “to demonstrate that the God, whose servant is Elijah, is the sole ruler of nature, against whose will no power in heaven or earth can prevail” (Skinner). This, in brief, was Elijah’s great message (v.s.).
§ 4. PRE-PROPHETIC INFLUENCES IN THE TIME OF ELISHA.
1. Close codperation of the prophet with the government, a conspiracy against the government and its overthrow by the insti- gation of the prophet, —all this took place in the days of Elisha (ca. 850-800 B.c.). In this we have the completion of the work initiated by Elijah.
The portions of 2 K. concerned with the life of Elisha may be classified: (1) 2% 41-628 81-15 1314-21, a series of early prophetic narratives of a personal or biographical character, loosely strung together and laying special emphasis on Elisha’s activity as a wonder-worker (to be designated by the symbol E>); (2) 3477 674-77 o}-6. 11-2. 30_1 027, 4 different collection of early prophetic narra- tives giving special attention to Elisha’s influence in affairs of state and in the campaigns against Syria and other nations (E?); (3) 318 71820 816-24. 25-29 g7-10 10%-41. 32-36, a series of later additions chiefly from the pen of the Deuteronomic compiler of Kings. Cf. the comm. of Kit., Benz., Burney, Skinner; and Kue. Einl. T- 80 ff.; We. Hex. 286-90; Addis, art. “Elisha,” £2.; Dr. LOT. 196f.; WRS. and K., art. “ Kings,” ZB,
This material presents some of the characteristics named above, notably, eg. (@) the magical element (strikingly similar, and even stronger), but there is little or no basis for the opinion (H. P. Smith, O. 7. Hist., p. 194, and others; cf. contra, Addis, ZB, 1276; Strachan, art. “ Elijah,” D&.; and the comm. of Kit., Benz., and Skinner) that the Elisha-memoirs are in large part a duplication of those of Elijah, and consequently unhistorical. (4) The lack of chronological order, as well as of chronological indication; and the result of this is to create a wrong impression of Elisha’s career (cf. Addis, EB. 1276;
xlii INTRODUCTION
Strachan, DB. I. 694; Benz.129; Kit. 185); for who really gathers from the narrative that Elisha lived forty-five years after the revolt of Jehu? A true conception of the case is prevented by the placing of this story at the end,
with all the anecdotes but one preceding.
2. The following points, although of secondary interest, may not be ignored :—
(1) The first meeting, at which the call was extended (by Elijah, it would seem, rather than by Yahweh himself),* took place at the home of Elisha’s family (which must have possessed substance; and consequently Elisha, like Amos, was not an ordinary zadhi’), some time after Elijah’s visit to Horeb,t
perhaps six or seven years before Elijah’s final disappearance, f in all a dozen _ years or so before the great revolution which unseated the dynasty of Omri. Elisha differed greatly from Elijah in appearance (cf. the phrase hairy man, 2 K. 18 [unless with Kittel, Benzinger, and Skinner, we refer this to the hairy mantle], with the epithet da/d-head, 2 K. 2”8) and in dress (cf. the mantle, 1 K. 19}%, which Elisha does not seem to have worn in later life; note 0°23, 2 K. 4). He used a staff, which, with the mantle, served him in his work as a magician. In a true sense he was a swccessor, since he it was who gave political effect to Elijah’s teaching,§ or, in other words, faithfully and resolutely carried out the policy of annihilating Baal and all that belonged to Baal, which was Elijah’s great legacy to the nation.|| In this case there is no exegetical nor historical sense in calling Elisha a “ demagogue, conspirator, revolutionist, and agitator” (Co. Proph. 33); the phrase “ father and guide of the Northern kingdom” (Addis, 2. 1276) seems more appropriate (p. xliv). (2) The story of the separation is late, and exhibits some peculiarities, two or three of which deserve mention; eg. how comes it that Elijah, who has always lived a solitary life, now sustains close personal relations with the pro- phetic societies? Perhaps he sees fit to change his habits now that the end is coming (Ew. Hist, IV. 80); or does this document present a different conception of Elijah (Skinner)? It is, rather, Elijah’s emphatic way of intro- ducing his successor, to whom he intrusts a task so terrible in its seriousness. The passage, therefore, has closer connection with the “ Elisha-stories” than with the “Elijah-stories.’ The “double portion” (2%) is not the portion of the first-born, Dt. 2117 (Thenius, Benz., Kit., Skinner, z doc. ; and Addis, EB. 1277); nor may we follow the literalizing view of Sirach (that Elisha performed twice as‘ many miracles as did Elijah); but rather it expresses Elisha’s desire that, having an even larger enduement of the divine spirit than his master, he may be able to carry the struggle of Yahweh begun by

Elijah to a successful issue (Maybaum, Propk. 76). On the purpose of the picture, as a whole, v.s., p. xxxvi. (3) The fact that Elisha’s habits were those of an agriculturalist at first, and later of a city dweller (in Jericho, 2 K, 218, Samaria, 682, Dothan, 6/8, Shunem, 4), Damascus, 87), plays an important part in contrast with Elijah’s nomadic manner of life (p. xxxvi), It is not enough to observe simply that here, as frequently, those are associated who differ greatly from each other (eg. Amos and Hosea, Isaiah and Micah); or that one kind of mind is needed for initiation, another for final execution. The case is incomplete, unless we realize the full significance, in this long ministry of, perhaps, fifty years, of Elisha’s “easy familiarity” and gentle manners, not only when he is sought out by kings (2 K. 621 1314), but also when he is visited on new moon or Sabbath (2 K. 4”) by the people who trust him implicitly. Was this demagoguery? Then Jesus also must have been a demagogue. Elijah’s whole career was a protest against civilization. Not so Elisha’s ; but rather an example of wise and effective adjustment, in spite of his strict religious views, to the new environment created by Ahab. This suggests (4) other points of character which come out in connection with some of the smaller events, such as the remarkable spirit of toleration (cf, Elijah during his residence in Zarephath) in the advice given Naaman the Syrian (Strachan, DB. I. 694); of humaneness, in his attitude toward the Syrian captives (6%); of intense love for Israel, in his reply to Hazael’s question, Why does my lord weep ? (81-18); * of widely recognized sympathy, as shown by the coming to him of widows and orphans (41); of the tremendous energy and fruitfulness of his work, if we may accept the estimate placed in the mouth of king Joash (134), for had he not been more to Israel than its chariots and horsemen?+ It will be noted that the data suggestive of these elements in Elisha’s character lie, for the most part, outside of the field of his political activity, and the circumstances connected with the revolution, on which v2.
3. Nothing in prophecy, or indeed in the entire Old Testament scripture, is more suggestive of wonderland than the stories which recount Elisha’s miracles. This idealization finds explanation in more than a single way; ¢.g. the writer thus makes expression of the profound feeling of love and esteem entertained by the people for Elisha, as well as of an equally profound belief in the love of Yahweh for his people, a love exhibited in the beneficent activity of the great representative, Elisha. Whether emphasis is to be placed upon the first or the second of these ideas will be determined by one’s fina! estimate of Elisha’s work as a whole.

xliv INTRODUCTION
We cannot fail to make three comparisons: (1) Of these miracles with those of Elijah (v.s. p. xxxvi); but here we should regard Elisha’s miracles neither, on the one hand, as grotesque and vulgar in so far as they are not pure imitation, and as altogether lacking in sanctification and grandeur,* nor, on the other, as something altogether ideal and above criticism of any sort.t (2) Of Elisha’s relation to Samaria during the Syrian wars, with Isaiah’s relation to Jerusalem in 701 B.C, during Sennacherib’s invasion ; but in making this comparison, we must remember that a century and a half full of good teaching for Israel has elapsed, and that while Elisha, as a matter of course, appears to less advantage than does Isaiah, it may well be questioned whether, upon the whole, the latter event was more critical than the former, and whether, likewise, the doctrine of Zion’s inviolability established in connec- tion with Isaiah’s preaching in 701 B.C. was not far more injurious to the Ysrael of the future, both ethically and politically, than the severe and, indeed, terrible measures apparently sanctioned by Elisha in the uprooting of Baalism. (3) Of Elisha’s miracles with those of Jesus Christ; were they not of the same general character ? Omitting the treatment of the children slain by bears, do they not represent the single idea of beneficence, that is, love ? From no other source does prophecy receive a contribution which so defi- nitely represents or anticipates the Christlike element (Addis, ZB. 1277). Surely this thought of love is a new idea in Israel’s religion. But is it just to attribute it to Elisha ? His life and work furnished the conception. Even if the stories are very late, and even if little historical fact may be found in them, they, at all events, reproduced Elisha’s character as it appeared to the people of his own times and of those that followed.
Much in these miracles relates to the pre-prophetic societies (§ 5). Elisha was strengthening and developing these societies for purposes of propaganda (Che. ZB. 3863). These societies were capable of exercising great influence on Israel. This method of warfare was more diplomatic than that of Elijah. It does not mean, however, that Elisha lacked courage (2 K. 3%). It is probable that in view of his feeling toward Joram, he did not use his house in Samaria to any great extent until after Jehu’s accession, but lived much of the time with the societies. This work was to have great significance in the further development of prophecy.
4. The political activity of Elisha is full of interesting problems. (1) Pre-prophetism, acting through him, now controlled the state. He was not merely an adviser like Isaiah. He was himself an active participant in the affairs of administration, “a decisive power in court and camp ” (Addis, 22.1277). In this he followed the example of a/ his predecessors. The time had not yet quite

come for the introduction of a new policy, viz. that of non-inter- ference except in so far as moral suasion might exert an influence. (2) His relations with foreign kings and potentates are of a re- markable nature. They seek him out. His reputation must have been widespread. Meinhold is right in pointing out that Well- hausen underestimates the influence of the prophets in these times. It is quite inconceivable how certain writers * count Elisha as of so small a value to Israelitish thought. Greater justice is shown him by others.f
(3) The account of the Moabite campaign of the king of Israel (2 K. 347) with his vassal kings of Judah and Edom possesses for us a larger interest even than that which its relation to the well-known Mesha inscription (a voucher for the historicity of this story) occasions, ¢ because, being evidently from the series of political stories (p. xli), it assigns to Elisha an important réle as political adviser, and, besides, refers to certain facts in connection with the prophet which aid us in formulating our estimate of him. We observe (@) the custom of making inquiry of the ebh2’im concerning war (cf. 1 K. 226f.) and when we recall the times of Saul and the beginning of the work of the nebhVim, we find ground for the supposition that the primary aim of these dervishes was to awaken the spirit of the nation for purposes of war (Schwally, Semitische Kriegsaltertiimer, 1. (1901), 103 ff.; K. D&B. V. 653); but (4) Eli- sha being discovered in the camp, the mere mention of his relation to Elijah (as the pourer of water on the hands = servitor) gives him standing in the eyes of the king of Judah, who in 1 K. 22 seems not to have known the Northern prophets. There is to be noted next (c) the statement of the king of Israel (v.*) which implies that the kings, in this case as in 1 K. ZZ, have undertaken this expedition by prophetic advice for which Yahweh was responsible; but (@) Elisha, following Elijah’s policy, will have no dealings with the king of Israel (whichever king it was) §; for the sake, however, of Judah’s king he will speak. But he cannot speak except in trance, and so (¢) as was his custom (mm, and it used to de, is frequentative), he asks for a musician (v.15) in order by the influence of music to excite himself into the ecstatic condition. This act, attested by 1 S. 10°, alluded to frequently in Arabian literature (WRS. Proph. 392), and recognized to-day as a powerful incentive to religious emotion (cf. the influence of music on Saul’s evil spirit, 1 S. 1616), seems to bear witness to three things : that Elisha (contra Elijah)

xlvi INTRODUCTION
is in close companionship with the medhi’im, that, while the spirit of Yahweh takes hold of Elijah spontaneously, artificial means are resorted to in Elisha’s case; and that consequently he belongs rather with those that preceded him in the prophetic work (¢.e. a lower order) than with those who followed (7.e. Amos and Hosea). The first of these all will accept; but are the other inferences strictly legitimate ? May not this act in his case have been merely the con- ventional way of announcing the oracle ? Is it really any more derogatory to his standing as a prophet than the ecstatic visions of Amos or Isaiah or Jere- miah or Ezekiel (v.z.)? (f) The method adopted to secure water (vs.16-19) was adapted to the possibilities of the locality (known for its sand-pits) ; cf. the plagues of Egypt. (g) The evident recognition (3%) of the efficacy of the sacrifice of the king’s own son to Chemosh is of interest in fixing the theological point of view of the writer.
(4) Evidence of Elisha’s political activity is seen, still further, in the stories of the healing of Naaman (5}-!%), of the entrapping of the Syrians in Samaria (688), of the siege of Samaria by Ben-hadad (624-720), with each of which important difficulties are connected ;* but, in general, they show the high esteem in which Elisha was held by all classes of men, his international as well as national reputation, his almost unlimited influence at home and abroad, and, at the same time, the great breadth of his mind, and his entire devotion to the nation’s God, Yahweh. We may not go so far as to infer that Elisha’s international greatness and his international relations furnished the basis for the idea of an international god, which, in turn, prepared the way for Amos’s position taken in chaps. 1 and 2; yet the high character of his work must be recognized.
5. The great revolution instigated by Elisha and executed by Jehu, described in 2 K. 9, 10, is one of the most important events in Israel’s history ; this importance relates to the political situation, but also, and especially, to the history of the pre-prophetic move- ment, the relation, in that movement, of both Elijah and Elisha to the history of Israel’s religion. This revolution placed on the throne the dynasty under which Amos and Hosea (in part) did their work.
That Omri’s dynasty had greatly strengthened Israel at home and ’ abroad is universally acknowledged.t That seed was sown in this revolution, which in the end proved Israel’s ruin, has not been denied since Hosea (1*) first announced it. We may call Jehu ambitious and bloodthirsty, and, since he undoubtedly believed
 
* E.g. the latter event is assigned to the reigns of Ahab (Benz.), Jehoram (We. ; H. P. Smith, O. 7. Hist. 196), Jehoahaz (Kue. Azmi, Ul 81 f.). ¢ Kit. Ast. II. 262; We. Prod. 458 f.; Sta. GV/. I. 518, 522.

himself to be acting for and in the name of Yahweh, a fanatic.* Sacred history fails to furnish a more ghastly series of official mur- ders, beginning with the shooting of Jehoram in his chariot, and closing with the horrible blood-bath of the Baal-worshippers in the temple. But there was prophetic precedent for the revolution, and the total destruction of the royal house, when dethroned, has been the regular routine in all Oriental revolutions.t Al- though by the revolution there was gained a destruction of the Baal cult, and although it was strictly in accord with Oriental policy, from the political point of view it was a blunder. t
It is more difficult to reach a decision as to the meaning of this event in connection with the pre-prophetic movement, and of the role played by the individual prophets. Apparently no great fault has ever been found with Elijah because of his share in it, and yet it was he who conceived and initiated the movement, indi- cated the exact lines of its execution, and selected specifically the agents who were to complete its execution. On whom, then, rests the responsibility ? If one may judge Elijah’s character by the impression which it produced upon his contemporaries and upon those immediately following him, he himself would have done, in detail, just what Jehu did; for did he not (1 K. 18*) actually slay the prophets of Baal (four hundred and fifty)? Did he not foretell the awful events which were to rid Israel of Baalism (197°) ? §
On the other hand, severe criticism has been meted out to

§ Bu. (Red. 122), concerning the reason for the prophets’ support of Jehu, says: ““There can be no doubt that the reason why Jehu was made the candidate of the prophets for succession to the throne was that he was known as a zealot for the pure worship of Yahweh. For this reason alone we might be sure that he and his Successors were unremitting in their zealous endeavor to maintain the worship of Yahweh in Israel pure and uncontaminated. This inference is fully confirmed — if we may trust the popular tales of the Second Book of Kings — by the fact that for full two generations the prophet is found firmly established alongside the king, as the bulwark of the throne.” Cf. also K. DB. V. 653.
xlvili INTRODUCTION
Elisha, who, it is maintained, is scarcely to be justified for his participation in the deeds of Jehu, even from the point of view of his own times.* It is suggested that he was entirely deceived as to Jehu’s character ; t or, in any event, though meaning well, lived on that lower plane of religious life which, as in the case of the patriarchs, did not forbid intrigue and bloodshed.}{ Now, in making our estimate of Elisha, let us recall (@) the lack of any word of disapproval from the pen of the narrators; (4) the won- derfully beautiful character portrayed by these writers, in which the features especially emphasized are humaneness, tenderness, compassion, and love,—the very opposite of those ascribed to Elijah (who can imagine Elisha as suggesting or favoring the policy of Jehu, except under the constraint of a controlling reli- gious conviction?); (¢) the strangely solemn circumstances of his appointment to office, and of his reception of Elijah’s legacy; (@) the opinion of Joash, when Elisha’s life is just closing, a strong testi- mony in favor of its magnificent value, while the estimate of Hosea is to be treated as we treat the anachronistic utterances of other prophets whose judgments concerning earlier events are deter- mined by the sympathies and antipathies of a later age.
With these points in mind, the question briefly stated is this: Was the religious crisis one of sufficient magnitude to justify the revolution? We do not wish, in any sense, to justify the intrigue and bloodshed connected with the revolution.
6. It remains to present, in the form of propositions, the answers to the questions that have thus far been raised (cf. pp. xxxviii ff. and xliv f.), all of which pertain to the significance of the revolution in connection with the progress of Israel’s religion.
(1) The contest, initiated by Elijah and completed by Jehu under Elisha’s direction, was one for which the higher prophetism of the period (860 to 800 B.c.) was responsible. It signified for pre-prophetism a great victory, and lifted it higher than it had before reached.
(2) The contest was a struggle, not so much with the old Canaanitish Baalism, which had largely disappeared, but with
 
* Co. Proph. 33; Addis, EB, 1278. t+ Cf, Kent, Hzs#. 11. 68. t Kent, Zoc. cit.
THE PRE-PROPHETIC SOCIETIES xlix
Phoenician Baalism, a new form of syncretism which, in view of all the circumstances, involved far greater danger to the interests of the Yahweh-religion (v.s.).*
(3) The point at issue was nothing more nor less than that of Yahweh’s existence; it was not simply that of giving him a lower place, but rather of his complete rejection; f for if Baalism had conquered, Yahwism would sooner or later have disappeared, just as Baalism disappeared after the victory of Yahwism.
(4) The conception of Yahweh which the prophets represent is higher than that of the past. For them he is, to be sure, a national God, but he sustains relations also to other nations, and exercises over them a large controlling influence. This is moving in the direction of an international God, although it has not reached that point.
(5) The religion for which they contend is something sites than a cult such as had existed in the past, but with its corruption eliminated. { It may be elected or rejected. It is one which makes ethical demands. Its ideal life for men is that of sympathy and love.
(6) The distinction is now for the first time drawn (though very vaguely) between the spiritual and the worldly, in other words between a true spiritual religion and nature-worship. §
The content of these propositions prepares the way for an examination of other pre-prophetic influences which antedated the work of Amos and Hosea; but before it receives a final formu- lation it requires a consideration of the other influences.
§ 5. THE PRE-PROPHETIC SOCIETIES.
1. The pre-prophetic societies constitute a phase in the devel- opment of pre-prophetism which bears closely on later prophecy. Omitting many points which do not stand in close relationship with the later development, the following may be regarded as the essential features for our immediate purpose, viz. (1) the numbers of the #ehz’7m, including the closely related sects of the Nazirites and Rechabites ; (2) the general purpose, character, and

1 INTRODUCTION
habits of these associations ; and (3) the question of their origin, their external and internal relations, and their place in history and prophecy.*
2. That these societies represented a large movement (whether patriotic, or religious, or both) is clear from the great numbers of nebhi’im referred to (viz. the one hundred hidden by Obadiah, 1 K. 18°; the four hundred in conference with Ahab, 1 K. 22°; the fifty or more residing at Jericho, 2 K. 2”"*), as well as the citation of some by name,t among whom we must select Micaiah ben Imlah for special mention, since a true estimate will place him side by side with Elijah and Elisha, and, in some respects, above both. These numbers signify not only deep interest in Yahweh-worship, but also an intense excitement because this worship was in danger from the Baalism of Tyre.
The failure of E?, which describes the public activity of the nebhi'im, to make any definite reference to the societies (but cf. 2 K. 9'=E?, and 1 K. 20%, probably late), as well as the silence of E> concerning any public activity on their part, is not to be interpreted either as destroying the value of the represen- tations made in each (for the narratives need not be taken as mutually exclusive {), nor as giving special weight to the opinion that the life of the societies was exclusively retired and devoted to worship and meditation, or, on the other hand, that it was largely public. As a matter of fact, it was both, the two narratives pre- senting different phases of the life of the zebhz’im.
From the lack of any mention of the societies between the days of Samuel and those of Elijah and Elisha, a period of more than one hundred and fifty years, we may not assume that with the pass- ing of the Philistine struggle they had died out and were later revived by Elijah. Against this may be urged, not only the num- bers just mentioned, but also the standing which they had in Ahab’s time as an order that must be consulted (1 K. 22°*).
* The most satisfactory treatments of this subject will be found in Kue. Proph- ets and Prophecy, 46 ff., and Rel. 1. 193-202, 316 ff.; WRS. Proph. 85 f., 389-392; GAS. I. 20-30; Maybaum, Die Entwickelung d. isr. Prophetenthums (1883), 30- 59: Da., art. ‘ Prophecy,” D&B. IV. tog f.; Bu. Red., 93-103; K. DB. V. 652 ff.

THE PRE-PROPHETIC SOCIETIES li
This silence may be accidental, or it may be due to the frag- mentary and incomplete character of the narratives as they have come down. So few are the names of preéxilic writing prophets preserved in the historical narratives (Isaiah alone, and in Je. 26"*, Micah) * that, but for the preservation of their utterances, one might deny their very existence.
In addition to the many nebhi’im, named and unnamed, and the societies which are so marked a feature of the times, cognizance must be taken of two sects, perhaps orders, vz. the Nazirites and Rechabites, the members of which, while not reckoned as nebht’im, share to some extent their ideas and their work as ser- vants of Yahweh.
The Nazirites (pp. 56f.), rarely mentioned, were individuals especially consecrated to Yahweh, the consecration taking the form of a vow or dedi- cation in which some restriction was assumed (eg. in the case of Samson, his unshorn hair, the possession of which secured to him Yahweh’s spirit ; note also the obligation placed upon his mother, during pregnancy, in refer- ence to wine and unclean food). We are not here interested in the later codification (Nu. 678-1321), but two things seem very suggestive: (@) the fact that Samson’s Nazirate involved exhibitions of great strength against Israel’s enemies, and was, in fact, a vow of abstinence solely for warlike purposes.f Was this perhaps the motive that led also to the organization of the bands of nebhi’im (v.i.)? (6) The reference of Amos (2!f) to Nazi- rites, in parallelism with prophets, who had been caused to drink wine, a sin as great as that which was committed in forbidding the prophets to prophesy. From this we must infer that the prohibition of wine (which was regarded by all nomadic tribes as a luxury belonging to agricultural life, t and was, like sensuality, a part of the routine of Baal-worship §), as well as that of cutting the hair was, at one time or another, the restriction assumed in the con- secration; but further, that this service was one which, like the prophetic service, received Yahweh’s approbation and was worthy of being cited along with it. Whether, now, this abstinence represented merely a service in war, uninterrupted by periods in which one yields himself to pleasure, that is, an absolutely unbroken service, || or rather (as with the Rechabites, v.72.) a sworn protest against Baalism (wine being a special product of Baal’s land),

lii INTRODUCTION
the general meaning is the same; for in both cases the purpose is protest, that is, consecration to war.
Another society or sect which seems to have been prominent in these times was that of the Rechabites, who appear and disappear in Israelitish history almost mysteriously. Assuming * that the Jehonadab whom Jehu took up into his chariot and thus joined with himself in his bloody work for Yahweh (2 K. 1015f) was the Jonadab cited in Jeremiah, chap. 35, as the ancestor of the Rechabites, who prohibited to his descendants the drinking of wine, we may make three assertions: (@) in Elisha’s times a sect or family or perhaps order existed, pledged not to drink wine (the symbol of a cor- rupted civilization), not to engage in agriculture or in the building of homes (that is, pledged to the primitive nomadic life); (4) this pledge was made in the service of Yahweh (cf. the names of those whom Jeremiah brought into a chamber of the temple, all of which end with Yah, and also Jeremiah’s closing words, viz. that for Yahweh’s service there shall always be sons of Jonadab); (c) the life of this society was a protest against luxury, intemperance, and idolatry, and against the Canaanitish civilization of the times; and was a reaction toward the primitive simplicity of Israel. We may leave unsettled the question whether this order was founded on the model of the Kenites ¢ (cf. 1 Ch. 255, Ju. 118, 1 S. 15°), or was really a family descended from them. “They represented in either case a type of anchoritism ” (Kautzsch) which was closely related in form, and especially in spirit, to that of the mebh?im and the Nazirites, the three together constituting a comparatively new and extraordinary propaganda for the old-fashioned idea of Yahweh as the god of the desert, and of storm and battle, —an idea which carried with it sim- plicity both of life and of cult.
3. A few points relating to the general character and the habits of these prophetic associations deserve consideration.
(1) While in Samuel’s time these societies were bands of men roving from place to place (probably in order to draw others into their association by the contagion of their enthusiasm), in Elisha’s time, they had adopted, more or less fully, a settled mode of life, their residences being at great sanctuaries like Gilgal (2 Kia), Bethel (2 K. 2°), or at political centres like Samaria, bands of fifty or more living together (2 K. 2’), and sometimes at a common table (2 K. 4%), while some among them were married (2 K. 4’).
(2) Samuel, although a prominent adviser, was probably never really a head (notwithstanding 1S. 19”), and surely never lived

with them (1 S. 19"), unless Naioth means “dwellings” ; * while it was a common custom for them to sz¢ defore (2 K. 4%, cf. 6") Elisha, as disciples before a master.
(3) These associations have been improperly mel “schools” ¢ since the members are already engaged in public work, and some of them are married, while no phrase occurs which would justify the use of the word. Moreover, the idiom of the title, sons of the nebhi’im, together with Semitic usage, requires the conception of guilds or corporations. Nevertheless, we are warranted in sup- posing that instruction was imparted (cf. 2 K. 4% 6); and proba- bly the prophetic technique and nomenclature which Amos found in existence had its origin among them. t{
(4) The members of the association did not prophesy as indi- viduals, but jointly in a body, and in their processions (1 S. 10°) they were, in fact, conducting a kind of public worship at the various high places or sanctuaries (ef. Is. 30”).
(5) The ecstasy (1 S. 19°) was the physical and psychological condition § in which they performed their service, “the hand of Yahweh” (1 K. 18“ 2 K. 3”) being upon them; and this “ holy frenzy,” which was frequently induced by music (cf. especially the case of Elisha), passed, according to E (Nu. 117**), in part, from Moses to the seventy elders, and lifted them into the condi- tion of ecstasy. Still further, it may be inferred from 1 K. 20% that the mebhi’tm bore a peculiar mark, which distinguished their service. ||
(6) In Samuel’s time this uprising had its occasion in the Philis- tine crisis, when Israel’s existence was threatened, and the result

was “a national religious enthusiasm,” which again came forward, perhaps more strongly, in the crisis of the Tyrian Baalism in the times of Elijah and Elisha. These national disasters are the expression of Yahweh’s anger; hence the reaction in the form of patriotic spirit, in other words, the spirit of battle.
(7) That Saul is thought to be insane, Elisha’s messenger “mad” (2 K. 9") ; that the word 99, 4 prophesy, means literally to drop (sc. foam), i.e. to foam at the mouth; and that the insane were looked upon in all Semitic antiquity with respect and awe as being controlled by demons (cf., ¢.g., David at the court of Achish, 1 S. 212), —all point to the presence of a large element of superstition upon the subject of prophecy, and also show its emo- tional and ecstatic character. With these facts before us, we may conclude in general that the spirit of these associations, while intense and upon the whole correct, was nevertheless as narrow as it was intense, as crude as it was correct; and that it partook largely of the spirit of the four hundred and fifty Baal-prophets, an association of very similar nature (v.2.).
4. The questions of their origin, their external and internal relations, are of great interest. (1) Concerning the origin we actually know little, but certain points may be grouped for consideration: The character of ancient Semitic life (v. eg. WRS. Sem.; We. SV. IIL; Barton, Sketch of Semitic Origins; Lagrange, Etudes sur les religions sémitiques), especially as seen in its purest form in Arabia,* was but slightly changed in these early days of Israel; and Palestine, like Arabia, with its desert life, its compulsory fasts (“in which the soul easily detaches itself and hunger lends the mind a curious passion, mixed of resignation and hot anger” [GAS. HG. 29; cf. Schultz, Theol. 1. 102 ff,]), its habit of continuous war, its uniformity of religious life (growing out of the exclusive attention to a tribal god), was well fitted to produce and develop fanaticism, as is shown by every century of past history, and by the presence to-day in the Mohammedan world of the dancing and howling dervishes, who, by a peculiar life and in strange ecstatic cries, seek to secure and to express their religious exaltation. Amid such surroundings the religious feeling, if at all awakened, becomes intense, and tends to an “entire self-surrender,” which finds concrete expression in a frenzied state, that sometimes involves self-mutilation, human sacrifice, and the tribute of maidens (Schultz, Zheol. I. 104).
 
* Every year since the work of WRS. brings Israel into closer relationship with Arabia; cf. the recent opinions of Barton, of. cét. 287 ff.; S. 1. Curtiss, Primitive
Semitic Religion To-day; and Che.’s Jerahmeelite hypothesis in £B., CB., and elsewhere.
THE PRE-PROPHETIC SOCIETIES ly
(2) The presence of Baal-prophets among the Tyrians, together with the facts that most of the growth in Israel’s ritual (and especially that of mantic and sorcery) came from the Canaanites, and that the idea of prophets or nebhi’im first appeared at this time, leads us to suppose that the pre-prophetic societies also were originally Canaanitish.* The occurrence of the word nadht’ in Phoenician, as well as in the Assyrian Nebo (= Hermes), points in the same direction. The Israelites, observing the prophesying (that is, the trans- port and frenzy) of the Canaanitish worshippers, adopted it, as they adopted many other rites (cf. the view that Yahweh himself was a Canaanitish god adopted by Israel; so Land, 727. II. 160 ff.; Wk]. Badel-Bibel und Brbel- Babel; but v. Kue. Rel. 1. 398 ff.; K6. Neue Rirchl. Zeitschrift, XIII. 828- 883). This, of course, implies merely that the external form, as in the case of circumcision, was taken by the Israelites, for within a short time it was spirit- ualized. The connection of all this with the spirit of war developed by the Philistine oppression has already been noted. Cf. 1 S. 10°, in which Saul is represented as entering into the state of frenzy at the very place in which the garrison (so AV., RV.), or pillar (so @, Thenius, Dr., Kit.; K. DB. V. 653), or administration (so H. P. Smith, BDB.) of the Philistines was placed.
(3) While in the earliest times, priest, seer, and zadh7’ were one, they now begin to differentiate. But, until later, the relation of priest and prophet was very close, as, in these early days, was that of priest and seer (cf. Samuel, and the Arabic £éhin, denoting seer, or soothsayer, probably, in early times, one in charge of ashrine). In later days, when there seems to have been antagonism between priest and prophet, this difference existed, not so much between the two orders, as between the priestly order and individual prophets who had risen above their fellows, and represented the prophetic order in general as being on the same low level with the priests (cf. WRS. Proph. 85, 105 ff.). In Isaiah’s time a priest (82) was selected to witness concerning a prophecy, while Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and other prophets of later times were themselves priests. It is probable, therefore, that in the early times the mebhi’7m were closely associated with the priests (McCurdy, YPAZ. § 488, note), as was true of the priests and prophets of Baal, and in Judah; cf. Je, 20!-? with 29% Lam, 2” (v.i.). The bearing of this upon the attitude of Amos and Hosea is significant ; cf, Am. 7}°-17 Ho. 4*° 5} 69.
(4) The unity, or joint action, of the mebhi’im has been mentioned (v.5.). This was an essential element in their strength. Elijah and especially Elisha seem to have worked harmoniously with the various societies, although they stood far above them. In Elisha’s own days, however, there lived a man who stood above and against his fellow-mebh2’im, and to whom the word prophet in its later and higher usage might well be given. This was Micaiah ben Imlah, whose story is told in 1 K. 228 (EP). The essential point for us in

lvi INTRODUCTION
this story is neither (a) the large number of prophets living at the time,* nor (5) the fact that the word of Yahweh is called for through the body of prophets as if it were a matter of regular routine; nor (c) the fact that their advice is asked in reference to a matter of war, and that they return a unani- mous answer. These things are interesting, but they do not constitute the essential element, which is (@) that Micaiah (who not infrequently prophesied in opposition to the king’s wishes, and was for that reason obnoxious to him), when sent for, delivers a message which is remarkable in the history of pre- prophetism. The position taken by Micaiah in opposition to the others deserves notice, since he is the first to break the unity which had thus far existed, — “a cleavage in the ranks of the prophetic body, which runs through the whole subsequent history of the movement” (Skinner, 7m /oc.). The significance of this cleavage is enhanced by certain features in the narrative, viz. the attitude of the king (already mentioned) (v.°); the earnest effort made by the messenger to bring Micaiah into harmony with those who have already spoken (v.18); the symbolical action of Zedekiah to corroborate and support the prediction of the four hundred (v.!2); the statement of Micaiah that he will speak what Yahweh has sent to him (v.!*) ; and his first utterance, which, after all, is identical with that already given, and promises success (v.}°). This was probably a piece of irony, and was so recognized by Ahab. When adjured to speak the whole truth, and with the background thus indicated, he announces two visions, the first, a prediction of Ahab’s death, and without special interest ; the second, a vision in which (a) he distinguishes between Yahweh on the one hand, and on the other a spirit, evidently recognized as a superhuman power, which produces the prophetic ecstasy; (8) he clearly recognizes the independence of this agent, but this spirit, we are told, be- comes a lying spirit in the mouths of the xedhz’im, and thus deceives them ; (y) he thus makes two strange representations, viz. that he, Micaiah, rather than the spirit, knows the will of. Yahweh; and further, that the falsehood which the four hundred have just spoken is to be charged, not “to the imper- fection of its human medium,” but to the superhuman agent acting with Yahweh’s approval (K. D&B. V. 656; Che. £2. 3859). In all this, however, it is to be understood that (6) he takes a position far above the ordinary nebhi’im, that knowledge comes to him which they do not share; in other words, that there are grades, or ranks, in the order, some higher and others lower. These “lower” or “narrow” or “ false” prophets are thus pointed out even at this early time, although they are still understood to be made use of by Yahweh (Volz, ZZ. 3874 f.). They have been called “ prophets of a narrow range of vision” (Volz), “the belated representatives of an earlier stage of
Ephraimite national narrative; it contains no reference to Elijah, and, in view of the four hundred prophets of v.6, contradicts the impression (1822) that Elijah was the only Yahweh-prophet left (cf. also 1818 1914),

prophetic development,” who “had closed their minds against the deepening of the idea of God to an unconditionally ethical conception, and were thus no longer able to penetrate into the depths of his counsel” (Bu. Rel. 1 31). We are immediately concerned with the bearing of this on the actual condition of the mebhi’im in the days of Elisha, and on Elisha himself (for if he occupies a high place, one, for example, side by side with Micaiah, how can he, neverthe- less, work harmoniously with the rest ?), and on the wedhi’im of Amos’s day. It is not quite fair to say that “ under the protection of Jehu’s dynasty proph- ecy so-called sank to depths of hypocrisy and formalism ” (WRS.). <A better statement would be that at this time pre-prophetism continued to occupy the low place which it had always occupied, save when some great personality like Elijah, or Elisha, or Micaiah was raised up; or, better still, let us dis- tinguish between prophecy, for which these great souls stood, and manticism (i.e. the nebhi’ismus), which is all that the others yet knew or cared for (Davidson, O. 7. Proph. 111 ff.; Kue. Rel. I. 196-7). Amos plainly shows his estimate of this crowd of edhz’im, when he maintains very forcibly that he is not one of them, and his words perhaps imply that it is no great honor to be regarded as one of their number (but z.7.).
5. It remains only to note the stages of this development and to indicate its place in the history of the pre-Amos time. Starting on the Israelitish side with sees (who are closely akin to priests), and on the Canaanitish side with zedhi’im (or dervishes), we see the two classes gradually growing together. From among them, or in close association with them, there arise from time to time certain great characters who share their peculiarities and adopt their methods, but at the same time reach far above them in their knowledge of the divine will. These men, not yet prophets in the technical sense, are the forerunners of the prophets, the connecting link between the old and the new, which begins with the writing prophets. This is their place in the development. What did these societies of nebhi’im do for the people among whom they lived? What influence did they exercise upon them?
It is certainly unjust to characterize them as “ hotbeds of sedition” and to limit their activity almost entirely to the sphere of politics (HPS. O. 7. fist. 193), or to consider them “a species of begging friars,” with but little influence among the people (Co. Proph. 13). It is with a truer appreciation of their services that Cheyne (Z&. 3857 f.) declares them to have been “a recognized sacred element in society, the tendency of which was to bind classes together by a regard for the highest moral and religious traditions.” Compare also the view of Kittel (ist, I. 266), that their chief interest was the “ fostering

of religious thought,” and that, as compared with the priests, they were “the soul, the latter the hand and arm, of religion”; the opinion of Marti (Rel. 81f.), that in times of peace they had little influence, but in national crises were invaluable in kindling a spirit of patriotism and devotion to Yahweh; the estimate of Wellhausen (Pro/. 461; similarly, WRS. Prop. 85 ff.), that they were not of “first-rate importance,” historical influence having been exercised only by exceptional individuals among them, who rose above their level and sometimes opposed them, though always using them as a base of operations.
They constituted one of Israel’s greatest institutions, which, like many others, came by adoption from the outside. But in its com- ing it was purified and spiritualized, and itself gave rise directly to an influence perhaps the most distinctive and the most elevating ever exerted on Israelitish life and thought.
§ 6. THe OLDER AND YOUNGER DECALOGUES.
Two important documents known as decalogues were formu- lated, and probably promulgated, in the pre-prophetic period. These decalogues now form a part of the Judaean and Ephraim- itic narratives, and might be considered in connection with those documents ; but they were originally independent of them, and their especial importance warrants a separate treatment. It is essential to ask: What was their origin? What was their message to the times in which they were published? What prophetic element do they contain? What is their relation to prophecy in general? We may not suppose that these, with the Book of the Covenant (§ 7), are the only laws of this early period that have been handed down ; others are probably to be found in Deuteron- omy and in the Holiness Code ; but these will be sufficient for the purpose we have in mind.
1. Zhe older decalogue,* found in Ex. 34”, consists, as recon- structed,t of ten regulations. These deal with the worship of

other gods, the making of molten images, the observance of three feasts and the sabbath, the offering of firstlings and first-fruits, and the avoidance of certain rites commonly practised in non-Israelitish religions.
This code, as well as the chapter of which it is a part, belongs to the Judaean narrative, but fits in badly with what precedes and follows it. It would seem to follow logically J’s introduction to the Sinaitic Covenant (Ex, 192-22 2), for one would scarcely expect new legislation to be given after orders had been received (cf. Ex, 3234 3318) to leave Horeb. In Ex. 34?8 it is called the ¢en words, and so naturally constitutes J’s decalogue, corresponding to that of E in Ex. 20 and Dt. 5. (The discovery of this decalogue was made by Goethe in Zwet wichtige bisher unerorterte Fragen, 1773 A.D.) While there may be some doubt whether this decalogue was a part of J from the beginning or found its present place in J at the hand of the editor who much later joined J and E, no one disputes its very primitive character, and, consequently, its early age. Arising in connection with some Judaean sanctuary (GFM. ZB. 1446), it represents a ritual of worship which is not only of an early age, but also indicative of a national religion. The very fact that it is so strongly ritualistic shows the pre- prophetic age ; and this is further attested by the pains taken to forbid cer- tain rites (¢.g. seething of a kid in its mother’s milk) which were common in non-Israelitish religions. It is, as Moore (ZB. 1446) says, “the earliest attempt with which we are acquainted to embody in a series of brief injunc- tions, formulated as divine commands, the essential observances of the religion of Yahweh.” But, on the other hand, it had its origin after the conquest of Palestine, because the background is agricultural throughout.
The message of the Judaean decalogue might thus be expressed : “Worship Yahweh, and Yahweh alone, without images (such as Northern Israel uses); let the worship be simple and in accord with the old usage ; forbear to introduce the practices of your Canaanitish neighbors.”
This message, notwithstanding its extremely ritualistic content, shows a perfect consistency with the pre-prophetic thought of 775-50 B.C.; for in three of the ten injunctions (viz. “Thou shalt worship no other gods,” “Thou shalt make thee no molten gods,” “Thou shalt not seethe a kid,” etc.) we have representations exactly in accord with the prevailing thought of the pre-prophetic reformers, while the other injunctions emphasize the simplicity of Yahweh’s requirements in contrast with the elaborate and sen- suous ritual of Baalism.
The earlier decalogue thus connects itself with the pre-prophetic

movement as it has thus far found expression, and prepares the way for a higher expression later on. At the same time it was not instituted as a measure of reform, but rather as the codification of existing practice. The publication, however, was not simply for the sake of providing a law-book ; it was rather an expression of the general prophetic (sometimes called historical) spirit illus- trated by J (cf. Gray, HB. 2732).
2. The younger decalogue, found in two forms, viz., Ex. 20 (E?) and Dt. 5 (D), presents a much larger field for conjecture and consideration.* This code consisted originally of ten injunctions, positive and negative, covering the relation of man to God and to his fellow-men.
In Ex. 19%- 919 we find, in a passage ascribed to E, the preparations lead- ing up to the giving of the laws, and in 2438 occurs the ratification of the same. The intervening chapters contain two important pieces of legislation, the decalogue (chap. 20) and the Book of the Covenant (chaps. 21-23).¢ In spite of the appropriateness of the present order (z.e. a body of general and fundamental principles, followed by a series of detailed laws dealing with the life of Israel in all its aspects), we are compelled to believe that the two codes have no direct relationship to each other, because (1) no such relationship is recognized in the historical part of the material; (2) chap. 20!*6 contains no reference to CC; (3) chap. 24 shows no evidence for connecting the two; (4) chaps. 32-34 make no mention of CC; (5) Dt., while it adopts the deca- logue as the basis of its code, shows no acquaintance with any other law given at Horeb; (6) Jos. 24 makes no reference to any other law. In view of these facts, it may be concluded that E’s original Horeb legislation was not CC, but the (later) decalogue.
But we are confronted with two or three important questions : (1) Is there other E material which could possibly have been connected with the Horeb legislation? (2) Is the decalogue in its present form (either Ex. 20 or Dt. 5) the original? (3) How
 
* That this decalogue was not an original constituent of the E narrative is held by Sta., Co., Carpenter and Battersby, who assign it to a Judaean recension of E; by Stark (Deuteronomium), who finds the original decalogue of E scattered through the Book of the Covenant; by Kue., We. (SV. 1. 68), Meissner (Der Dekalog), Bantsch, Sm. (Rel.2 273), Marti (Rel. 174), Addis (ZB. toyo), and Matthes (ZA W. XXIV. 17-41), who assign it to the seventh century. Holzinger (Zxod., in loc.) places it in the latter half of the eighth century.
+ This may be called the Covenant Code, and represented by the symbol CC.
THE OLDER AND YOUNGER DECALOGUES lxi
early in the history of E did the original decalogue occupy its present position?
(1) It is probably true * that there was an earlier legislation (E1) of which only fragments now exist, viz. the account of the tent of meeting (337), with, perhaps, an account of the construction of the tent (for which P’s elab- orate description was substituted), and of the ark for which the tent was made, together with the ritual found in 20%26, It will be noted that this earlier legislation of E, according to this hypothesis, was supplanted, partly by P’s material concerning the ark and the tent, partly by the decalogue (and the story of the golden calf, Ex. 32, which may be called E?), leaving certain fragments only (v.s.).
(2) The present form of the decalogue gives evidence of considerable expansion from the original ten words, eg. the very striking differences in the two versions as given in Ex. and Dt., the great difference in the length of the injunctions, and the internal character of the material itself. The original ten words, stripped of all these later additions, were probably as follows : —
Thou shalt have no other gods beside me.
Thou shalt not make for thyself any graven image.
Thou shalt not utter the name of thy God for an evil purpose. Remember the sabbath day to sanctify it.
Honor thy father and thy mother.
Thou shalt do no murder.
Thou shalt not commit adultery,
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house.

(3) How early, then, is the younger decalogue? (a) It cannot t+ come from the times of Moses, for tradition regards Ex. 34 as “the ten words”; it is unknown to CC; it is in a measure inconsistent with the ritualistic religion of the pre-prophetic time. (4) Is it then as late as the days of Manasseh (cf. Mi. 6&8), t and if so, is it the product of the ripest prophetic thought? The answer turns upon the fulness of interpretation given to the several command- ments, the turning-point in the whole matter being the specific prohibition of the use of images in the second commandment, and the alleged highly devel- oped ethical system underlying the whole. The former, it is claimed, cannot be earlier than the eighth century, for until this time there seems to have been no knowledge of such a prohibition. The latter must, it is thought, represent the

Ixii INTRODUCTION
result of the prophetic teaching at least down to and including Isaiah. The question, therefore, of the prophetic character of the decalogue and of its relation to prophecy depends wholly on the date, and this on the degree of ethical development which it is found to contain.
(c) We may not accept Eerdmans’s suggestion (747. XXXVII. 18 ff., made with a view to placing the original as early as Moses) that some other commandment originally stood in the place of what is now the second (the present second belonging to the seventh century), or that in the original form there were seven instead of ten; but the principle underlying this suggestion, which has been accepted by Kautzsch (DB. V. 633°), is sound and is to be allowed a controlling place in our decision; viz. that the commands and prohibitions of the decalogue “have not an absolute, but a relative scope” (K.). This means that the ethical conceptions which are connected with the decalogue in our modern times have been read into it, and were not originally so understood. The earlier thought was one not of morals but of rights. Eerdmans goes still further and limits the application of the commandments, eg. the killing to one’s countrymen, and the coveting to the appropriation of property that was ownerless. Nor is Wildeboer’s criticism ( 7%Sz., 1903, 109—- 118) of this valid when he says that thus the deeper moral sense of the decalogue is degraded.
(d) Concerning the second commandment in particular, it may be said in passing: Its close association with the chapter on the Northern calves (Ex. 32) has some significance. The fact that the central sanctuary in the times of Eli, David, and Solomon seems to have had no image indicates the presence of a strong sentiment opposed to image-worship, if not an actual prohibition. The non-observance of such a prohibition in Northern Israel is no evidence of the non-existence of the law. Account must also be taken of the sentiment in the South (as represented by Isaiah in his early ministry), which must have existed some time before Isaiah. The presence of a similar law in the older decalogue of J supports the early origin of the prohibition.
Upon the whole we shall be justified in assigning the formulation of the younger decalogue in its original form, even with the second commandment, to a period not much later than 750 B.c., the arguments for a still later date * not being convincing.f
The message of this younger decalogue to its times was three- fold: (1) Acknowledge (cf. in the older, worship) no other god, and follow not other religions in making images, or in using

the divine name for purposes of sorcery ; but observe the sabbath (as representing Yahweh’s ordinances), and pay respect to Yah- weh’s representatives. These are Yahweh’s rights; do not do violence to them. (2) Do not do violence to the rights of your neighbor, as they relate to his person, his wife, his property, or his reputation. Still further, (3) do not even ¢hink of doing violence to any of your neighbor’s rights.
The younger decalogue thus harmonizes completely with the growth of the prophetic thought as thus far (760 B.C.) developed. With the higher conception of God (v.7.) a more rigid adherence to him is demanded, and a more concrete separation from the ritual customs which had been in vogue. Still further, sorcery must be banished. While as a corollary it follows that the insti- tutions of Yahweh in their simplicity must be observed 3 and re- spect will be shown Yahweh by honoring those who, in his place, have power of life and death.* The prophetic element, in the first table, is clearly seen in the first, second, and third command- ments ; but did the prophets really advocate the observance of insti- tutions? Yes; for (1) they could not do away with a/ institutions, and in the very act of rooting out the Baal ritual, they must fall back on something; and besides (2) their connection with ritual is seen in J’s including the earlier decalogue, in E’s including another decalogue, in D’s including an enlarged code of ritual. As to the fifth commandment, while we are unable to distinguish the extent to which the spirit of ancestor-worship still influences opinion, it can hardly be supposed that all trace of it has yet disappeared.
The original obligation in the fourth commandment was (not that which P or D later inserted) to treat the Sabbath as Yahweh’s property, and therefore not put it to the profane uses which had formerly been customary in connection with the heathen cult t (cf. Am. 8° Ho. 2”).

t The need of such a law and the prophetic character of it at once become ap- parent, if the supposition be correct that the sabbath was taken over from the Canaanites, who had themselves gotten it from Babylonia (so Reu. Gesch. d. Alt. Test. § 73, Anm.; Sm. Re/.2 160; Now. Arch. I. 144; Benz. Arch. 202, 465; Holzinger, £xodus, 73). The task of prophecy was to purify it from its Canaanitish associa-
lxiv INTRODUCTION
In the commandments of the second table the case is even clearer. With the examples of David and Solomon and Ahab, in connection with whom the prophets have actually said the same things that are found in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth com- mandments, it is easy to see that a prophetic redaction after Elijah must contain just these points (v.s. as to meaning of each). The important step forward which the tenth commandment contains, viz. not to Zink of violating one’s neighbor’s rights, is noticeable, but, after all, in harmony with the active intellectual effort of the times which produced the philosophical work of J and E (v.2.).
(6) With this understanding of the message, and of the pro- phetic element in it, we can discover its close connection with the pre-prophetic movement. Its formulation can be ascribed to the intense religious feeling which is just beginning to recog- nize the rights of Yahweh and of men; it is in a sense the product of prophetic thought, but, more strictly, that of pre-prophetic thought.
§ 7. THE Book OF THE COVENANT.
The Book of the Covenant (= CC), to which reference has already been made, was promulgated, substantially in its present form, with prophetic sanction, as early as 800 B.C., or half a century before Amos and Hosea. We may ask, as before, as to its origin and marks of date, its message, the prophetic element in the message, and its relation to the pre-prophetic movement.
1. This book (Ex. 21-23) contains two kinds of material. The first part (212-22") is a series of “ hypothetical instructions, based presumably on precedent” (Gray, EB. 2734) ; in a single word, judgments (cf. Ex. 21", 24°, Nu. 35°), or judicial decéstons ; regu- lations, seemingly intended for the use of judges, and dealing with questions of civil and criminal law.* The second part (22¥%-23”) is a series (with some interruptions, ¢.g. 92 2 ath 00.12)

* The following subjects are treated in this portion: (1) Regulations regarding slaves, 212-11; (2) personal injuries, 2112-27; (3) injuries and damages in connection with cattle, 2128-86; (4) theft, 221-4; (5) damages to crops, 2256; (6) breaches of trust, 27-15; (7) seduction, 2216f

of precepts relating to life and worship,* evidently other than legal in character ; regulations of a moral and religious character, having especially to do with the deity and worship.f
2. An examination of the material soon discloses that (a) the original form of this material has suffered both in the way of mutilation and in actual loss, t for all of which full allowance must be made 3 while (4) a considerable amount of new material, joined with the original text, must be set aside (v.s.) if we are to reconstruct the original document or documents; still further, (©) the laws on ritual (2314419) are practically identical, even verbally, with 34388 (the earlier decalogue), and belonged originally in chap. 34, whence they have been transferred by an editor; § (@) the second part (2218-2319) is more diverse in character than the first, and is itself plainly a compilation of different elements, || some of which betoken a Deuteronomic origin; (¢) the narrative (23°08), which in its present form is late, contains old material that originally stood in close connection with CC, viz. vs.20-22- 25. 26, and especially vs.78-81; {| (/) the regulations in 2078-26 have no connection with the preceding decalogue (vs.-!7), and should be taken ** with the “words” (cf, 2278-81),
3. CC, with such modifications as are involved in the preceding (cf. 2), now suggests two series of questions: (1) Did the author of the Judgments also collect the frecepfis? or is CC, as we have it, a growth? Various schemes of reconstruction have been proposed,tft of which G, F, Moore’s is,

tt Sta. (GV, 1. 636) recognizes two divisions, viz, “words” and “judgments,” questions whether they originally had any connection with each other, and suggests that the words originally all stood together under their own superscription; and that when the latter was dropped the present confusion arose. Rothstein (Bundes- buch, 1888) regards CC as an expansion of the decalogue and attempts by a series of violent transpositions, resulting in worse confusion than that which now exists, to rearrange its contents in an order corresponding to that of the subject-matter in the decalogue. Stark (Deuteronomium, 1894, 32 ff.) finds three strata of laws: (1) six laws, somewhat later than the J decalogue, viz. 2112. W-19; (2) the “judgments” of

perhaps, the simplest, viz. there existed originally (@) a book of judgments; to this was added (4) the “ main stock” of 22182313, i.e. the Horeb legis- lation of E; then (c) the ritual 23/419 (taken from J, 3414f) was attached, probably by the editor who (¢ ) wrote the closing story (2338). In this case the substance of CC is as early as E (v.s.).
(2) Some suppose that CC formed a part of the original E; * in this case CC would be: (a) the law given at Horeb as the basis of the Sinaitic Cove- nant (but we have both what may fairly be regarded as the original basis (E), as well as the decalogue substituted (v.s.) for the original); or (4) a con- tinuation of the decalogue (Ex. 20!) and so a fart of the Sinaitic Covenant (u.s.); or (¢) the document which led up to the renewal of the covenant and so was connected with Moses’ parting words in the plains of Moabt; or (d) the “statute and ordinance” of Jos. 242-27, thus representing the law given as the basis of the covenant made at that time, whence it was removed by RD to its present position.{ But no one of these suggestions is free from difficulties, although the consideration in favor of the proposition is impor- tant, viz. the general similarity of CC to E.
It seems upon the whole easier to believe that CC was a separate book from E,§ inserted in E by the editor who was himself the compiler of CC.
 
212-2216, from a later date than the preceding; and (3) a group of ethical and reli- gious laws, a sort of programme of the prophetic activity, viz. 2024 ff. 2217. 20. 24f. 27 f. 231-8. 6f. 10-1214, Bertheau (Sieben Gruppen Mosaischer Gesetze, 1840) first arranged CC in decades, viz. (1) 20717; (2) 21711, (3) 211227, (4) 2128-2216 (5) 2217-30, (6) 231-8, (7) 231419; this involved the treatment of 2022-26 as four introductory com- mands, 239-18 as an interpolation, and 23768 as a closing decalogue of promises. Briggs (Hex, 211-232) includes in the original CC only four pentades and one decalogue of “words,” viz. 20°3-26 2271-29 231-8 236-9 2310-19, This was enlarged by the addition of two pentades, three decalogues, and a triplet of “judgments,” viz, 212-11 2118-25 2726-86 2137-203 2e4f 226-16. The remaining laws are later inser- tions showing traces of Deuteronomic redaction. Paton (JBL.

The material in this case may have had its origin as follows (v.s.) * : (a2) Ex. 234 = 34(J); (6) the judgments may have been a part of E standing after chap. 18, which itself originally stood later in the narrative; (c) the pre- cepis, now somewhat obscured in 2218 23, were probably that part of the Horeb legislation (E1) for which the decalogue (v.s.) was substituted.
It is to be observed that all of these various hypotheses agree in assigning to the substance of CC and in large measure to the form which we now have, an age contemporaneous with or preceding that of E (v.z.). CC embodies “the consuetudinary law of the early monarchy.” f
4. The presence of CC in E (or JE)is due toa religious purpose on the part of the author or editor ; this purpose, however, par- takes of the historical spirit rather than of the legal or reformatory spirit. In other words, no effort was being made, as later in the case of the Deuteronomic code or the Levitical code, to gain rec- ognition from the people for a new legislation. t This appears, not only from the small proportion of the whole of E which CC constitutes, but also from the fact that its laws are based on long- established usage, or codify moral precepts which had already been taught; the presence of CC indicates also, from the point of view of E (or the editor), a complete harmony of thought between the content of CC and the material of E; the message of CC, therefore, becomes a part of the larger message of E, and receives interpretation from the latter.
The regulations (“judgments” and “ precepts ") are entirely consistent (1) in treating the deity as the direct and exclusive source of judgment and authority; (2) in recognizing that a time has now come in the affairs of the nation when the rights of the community are to be considered, with a view to restricting the action of individuals in so far as they are injurious to the com- munity (cf. the decalogue); (3) in continuing to accept certain principles which have long prevailed in Semitic life, e.g. (@) that of retaliation, which included the ex falionis, (b) that of blood revenge, and money compensation for injuries committed, there Bile SIR LS UTR Re See ee

being no punishment by way of degradation ; (4) in having as a basis on which everything rests the agricultural form of life.
The regulations, as already indicated, (a) when studied from the point of view of worship, represent the customs of the past * in their comparative purity and simplicity, but at the same time emphasize the restriction of such worship to Yahweh (monolatry) ; nothing new is here presented; (4) when considered from the point of view of ethics, emphasize two or three important points, viz. the setting apart of the sabbath as a day of rest, the giving to the poor of the produce of the land during one year in seven, the distinction between murder and manslaughter, the securing of justice to the foreigner, the restoration of ox or ass to one’s enemy, the urgency against oppression and maladministration of office. ,
In general, then, the message was one of an elevating character in its moral attitude, advocating, as it does, absolute “ rectitude and impartiality” in methods of administration ; mildness, pro- tection and relief from severe life for the poor, the foreigner, and the slave; a generous attitude even toward one’s enemy (23"). t
5. The prophetic element is manifest ; so manifest, indeed, that many have regarded CC as the result of the later prophetic work. It is more correct, however, after making proper allowances for the Deuteronomic additions, to regard this as the expression of that religious and ethical development which had its source and strength in the movement of the times of Elijah and Elisha, and of J and E, and, therefore, as preparatory to the period of prophecy beginning with Amos and Hosea.§ This view is to be accepted because of (1) the marked linguistic and phraseological affinity of CC to E; (2) the large proportion of the code given to the treatment of secular matters (cf. the similar nature of the Code

of Hammurabi), a sign of a comparatively early date;* (3) the primitive character of many of the regulations and ideas, e.g. “ the conception of God as the immediate source of judgment” (Driver) ; the principle of retaliation and the law of blood revenge, ideas still dominant among the Bedouin; the more primitive tone of 22” as compared with 34”; and the conception of woman which appears in the provision for the estimate of a daughter’s dishonor, as so much damage to property, to be made good in cash (cf. the higher ideal of Hosea).
§ 8. THE JUDAEAN NARRATIVE (J).
This narrative of world- and nation-history had its origin within the century 850—750 B.c., and, with the closely related Ephraimitic narrative, is at once an expression of the pre-prophetic thought and the basis for a still higher development of that thought. What may be gathered from this most wonderful narrative, throughout prophetic in its character, for a better understanding of the pre- Amos period ?
1. Four propositions relating to the Hexateuch are now all but universally acknowledged and may be stated without discussion :—
(1) The Hexateuch is made up in general of three distinct elements, viz. the prophetic (JE), the prophetico-priestly, found mostly in Deuteronomy (D), and the priestly (P), these elements being joined together, first JE with D, and later JED with P.f
 
* It is still a question whether the relationship of CC to the Code of Hammurabi is (a) one of direct dependence (as close, indeed, as the relation of the early stories in Genesis to the Babylonian legends), since, in a number of cases, the laws are practically identical (so Johnston, Johns Hopkins University Circular, June, 1903) ; or (2) one of racial affinity, z.e. of common tradition, without any direct influence, much less, borrowing (so Cook, D. H. Miiller, Kohler); or, perhaps, (3) one of entire independence, with CC, however, greatly influenced by a Babylonian envi- ronment (so Johns, DZ. V. 610 ff.). While the existence of such a code as that of Hammurabi, at the early date of 2250 B.C., strengthens the arguments for an early date of CC, it does not furnish any proof that CC could have existed in its present form earlier than the stage of civilization (viz. the agricultural) in which it is plainly imbedded.
t The details do not concern us in this connection; for the most recent dis- cussion of these details, v.

F. Moore, Gray, Bertholet, Holzinger, and Driver.
\xx INTRODUCTION
(2) The prophetic element, with which alone we are now con- cerned, is itself the result of a union of two distinct documents ; and while these two documents may not be clearly distinguished from each other in certain phases, they nevertheless stand apart, in the greater portion of the material, to an extent which is no longer seriously questioned.*
(3) J is a Judaean narrative, having its origin in the king- dom of Judah, while E (v.z.) arose in Northern Israel. The evidence of J’s Southern origin is not so clear as is that of E’s Northern origin, but with the practical certainty of the latter, the probability of the former follows. This, moreover, is strengthened when we observe (a) the prominence attached to certain distinc- tively Southern sanctuaries in the patriarchal narratives; (4) the conspicuous place assigned to Judah among Jacob’s sons (Gn. 37% 43° 44° 49”), cf. the corresponding place assigned to Reuben and Joseph in E, and the absence in J of any very sure allusion to Joshua; (¢) the improbability that two such similar _ narratives as J and E circulated side by side in the Northern kingdom, and (@) the presence in Gn. 38 of traditions con- cerning families of Judah, which would have little interest for a non-Judahite.f
(4) J, although for the sake of convenience spoken of as a narrative, or indeed as a narrator, represents a school of writers covering a period of perhaps a century or more. It is necessary, therefore, in the use of J to distinguish with care the different strata. For practical purposes, however, we may speak of J’ as the original J, and of the material assigned to J? or J* as ad- ditions. {

THE JUDAEAN NARRATIVE Ixxi
The time relations of J! seem to be those of 850 to 750 B.C., or possibly a little later. Only a few would assign a later date.* This unanimity of opinion rests upon (@) the fact that the prophetic character of J is less definite than that of Amos and Hosea, seeming, therefore, to belong to a more primitive stage in the development of the spirit of prophecy; (4) the proba- bility that Am. 2° Ho. 9!° 123f12f are based upon the written narrative of J; (c¢) the literary style and the religious development found in Amos and his immediate successors imply the existence of religious writings with which they and their listeners were familiar; (ad) the fact that the narrative of J continues into the days of Joshua implies its post-Mosaic origin; (¢) the national spirit everywhere characteristic of it did not exist until the age of the monarchy, when Israel for the first time realized its unity; (/) the probability that the same school of writers has contributed to the Books of Samuel and Kings; (g) the friendly attitude toward the Philistines appearing in the narratives concerning the dealings of Abraham and Isaac with them could not have arisen until a long time after the hostilities of the reign of David; (4%) the reign of Solomon is evidently looked back upon as a sort of golden age (cf. Gn. 1518 and 1 K. 471; Gn. 97 and 1 K. 9?); (2) such names as Zaphenath-paneah and Poti-phera are unknown in Egyptian writings until the post-Solomonic period; (/) Jos. 6% points back to the reign of Ahab; cf. 1 K. 16%4,
2. The scope of J includes the history of the world from the creation of Adam down to Abraham, the history of Israel’s patriarchal ancestors from the selection of Abraham down to the residence in Egypt, the history of the nation under the leadership of Moses and Joshua(?) down to the conquest of Canaan. It is altogether probable that the same school (v.s.) of writers continued the work down through the times of the monarchy, giving us the earlier portions of Samuel and Kings.t

to the settlement in Canaan discloses a definite purpose in the mind of the author of this literary creation.* The purpose is twofold, relating on the one hand to the origin of Israel as a nation and Israel’s relation to the neighboring nations, and, on the other, to the close connection of Yahweh with this origin and development. Nearly every story in the long series finds its true interpretation from this point of view.t This is in perfect har- mony with the national motive which underlies the work of Elijah, Elisha, and other zedhz’2m (§§ 3-5), with the higher place which Israel is just at this period taking among the nations, and, like- wise, with the new ideas of Yahweh which were appealing with such force to those who breathed the prophetic inspiration (p. xlix). This religio-political motive includes also the desire to give expression to new and larger conceptions of God and man and life (zv.2.). This historical interest does not concern itself with matters of an institutional character (this was P’s great responsibility). It is the heroes of ancient history and the scenes of the olden times that the Judaean narrative delights in. For this reason practically no care is given to providing chronological indications, and hardly more to the chronological arrangement of the material. { It is the spirit that controls throughout, nowhere the letter. It is not difficult to connect this expression of a true religious spirit with the reformation in Judah, almost contempo- raneous (six years later) with that of Elisha and Jehu in Israel, which was, after all, only the conclusion of the former, resulting, as it did, in the overthrow of Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel.
3. One of the principal problems of the Judaean narrative requires at least a passing glance, viz. that of the world-stories with which the narrative of J opens.§ What was their origin? What was their place in the narrative as a whole? We cannot
 
* Reuss (Gesch. d. heil, Schrift d. A. T. § 214) not inappropriately characterizes J as a “national epic.” Dr. (Zhe Book of Genesis, p. xiv ) declares J to be “the most gifted and the most brilliant” of all the Hebrew historians,

longer deny the close formal connection of these traditions with the similar traditions of other peoples.* Nor can we suppose that the various forms which these same stories take on among other nations are derived from an original Israelitish form. Israel received this material from the same sources as those from which other nations received their stories. It is a heritage common to many nations. At the same time it is quite certain that Israel came into peculiar relations with the older Babylonian tradition, not so much in a direct way through the earliest ancestor Abraham,f as in a more indirect manner, viz. through the Canaanitish ele- ment, which itself contained much that was Babylonian.t The transformation which these stories have undergone is strictly in accordance with the spirit of the narrative as a whole, and might well be taken to represent the whole, since it shows the prophetic motive, not only in general, but in detail, and illustrates practi- cally every phase of that spirit. Moreover, these stories (found in Gn. 2-11) furnish not only the starting-point, but the basis, for the Judaean narrative, establishing at the very beginning the essential view-point of the narrative. This is seen especially (1) in the place assigned Yahweh in reference to the outside nations; (2) in the importance attached to the conception of sin, and likewise that of deliverance ; (3) in the attitude shown toward the progress of civilization; (4) in the preparation already made for giving Israel her place among the nations; and (5) in the details of prophetic method and procedure.
4. This prophetic factor appears in several of the most important characteristics of the narrative.§ Only a few of these may be mentioned : —
(1) The purpose and spirit (v.2.) are distinctly prophetic, since the writer assumes to be acquainted with the plans of the deity, and in fact to speak for that deity under all circumstances ; e.g. he declares the divine purpose in the creation of woman (Gn. 2°) ;

lxxiv - INTRODUCTION
he assigns the cause and motive of Yahweh’s act in sending the Deluge (Gn. 6'”) ; he knows the exact effect of Noah’s sacrifice upon the divine mind (Gn. 87); he sees the divine purpose in the confusion of tongues (Gn. 11°*) and in the selection of Abram (Gn. 12'*) ; he also describes the scene between Moses and Yahweh on the top of Pisgah (Dt. 34'**).
(2) The national element, so prophetic in its character, dis- plays itself (a) in the great prominence given to stories in which the principal heroes are reputed national ancestors, such as those concerning Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Joseph, Moses; (4) in the recital of events which had to do with the national progress, such as the journey into Egypt, the Exodus, the covenant at Sinai, the conquest, the settlement, — these being the very foundations of the national history; (¢) in the evident desire to represent Israel as unique among the nations, since she, a direct descendant (through Noah, Abraham, and others) of the first man Adam, had been definitely chosen by Yahweh as his own peculiar people ; and to represent the affairs of the world as arranged in such a way as to secure the best interest of a single people, Israel ; * (@) in the naive and primitive method adopted to show Israel’s superiority to their more closely related neighbors, viz. by connecting some form of reproach with the origin of the nation concerned, e.g. Canaan in the story of Noah (Gn. 9”*) as a slave to other peoples ; Moab and Ammon (Gn. 19%) as the offspring of Lot by incest ; ft Ishmael (Gn. 16"*) as the son of a handmaid ; Edom as inferior in ability and character from the beginning ; various Arabian tribes as being descended from Keturah, Abraham’s second wife, and as not receiving a share in Abraham’s property (Gn. 25'°).
(3) The predictive element is, of course, prophetic ; “ the patri- archal history is, in his (J’s) hands, instinct with the consciousness of a great future” (Driver). (@) The history of sin is pictured (Gn. 3”) with unerring accuracy, as a long and painful struggle
 
* This conception is clearly found in J (cf. 137 2218 264), although the word “choose”’ is used first of Israel in Dt. 487.
t Cf., however, Gunkel’s conjecture that this story is of Moab-Ammonite origin, and in early times bore no tinge of reproach; but on the contrary was a eulogy of the daughters of Lot, who took such heroic measures to secure children, and also preserved thereby the purity of the tribal blood.
THE JUDAEAN NARRATIVE Ixxv
between humanity and the influences which tempt man to evil, a struggle which in the very nature of the case must mean victory for humanity ;* (4) Israel’s relations to other peoples are pro- phetically interpreted in Gn. 9%”;f (¢) glimpses of Israel’s future numbers and power are given to the patriarchs, Isaac (Gn. 277%), Jacob (Gn. 48% 49°) ; while (@) a forecast of Israel’s future relations to the world at large is placed in the mouth of a foreign prophet (Nu. 24”).
These predictions represent the very thought of the prophet concerning the Israel of his own day, the position already gained, or that which, with the encouragement thus given (?.e. by the rhe- torical and homiletical use of prediction), may be expected. They are, in other words, “prophetical interpretations of history” (Driver).
(4) The prophetic element is seen also in the zdealism which permeates the narrative throughout. The writer makes word- pictures of events and characters in life, in order that his contem- poraries, observing the ideal life thus represented (whether it is an ideal of good or an ideal of bad), may lift their life from the lower plane to a higher.
The story of Abraham is a pen-portrait presenting the ideal of intimate acquaintance and communion with Yahweh, and consequent faithfulness and obedience (cf. Che. HB. 24). In the story of Joseph, he pictures the final victory of purity and integrity in spite of evil machinations on the part of those who are rich and powerful (cf. Dr. DB. II. 770). In the picture given us of Israel’s oppression in Egypt, and deliverance from the same by the out-
stretched hand of Yahweh, we see Israel as a nation brought face to face with the mightiest power on earth, and triumphing over that power with all its gods.
 
* This passage implies, if it does not promise, victory; cf. Dr. Genesis, 48, 57, and contra Holzinger, 7m loc., who denies to it ethical content and limits its meaning to an explanation of the well-known antipathy of man to the serpent family; also Gunkel, who interprets it as explaining the perpetual hostility of man and the serpent family, as a punishment for their league against Yahweh.
+ Whether we understand (1) as formerly (also recently by Dr. of, czt. p. 111) the three great powers of civilization, the Semitic, the Japhetic, and the Hamitic, or (2) with We., Sta., Bu., Meyer, Holzinger, merely Israel, Canaan, and Philistia or Phoenicia; or (3) with Gunkel (Shem =) the Aramaean-Hebrew peoples, and (Japhet =) the northern peoples (2.e. the Hittites).
t On the Musri hypothesis of the Exodus this exalted conception of Yahweh’s power disappears from the story in its original form, but, even if the hypothesis be accepted, the transformation into an Egyptian Exodus must have taken place prior to the times of J.
Ixxvi INTRODUCTION
Stories of this kind, and there were many such, were intended to lead men into a higher life, and to give the nation a confidence in its destiny.*
(5) A true prophetic conception expresses itself in the attitude of the Judaean narrative toward the progress of civilization. Here J follows in the footsteps of those who preceded him, and joins hands with the Nazirite and the Rechabite (v.s.).
This antagonism, a corollary of the views entertained concerning sin (v.2.), shows itself in connection with (a) the story of the murder which accompanied the building of the first city (Gn. 4216); (4) the beginnings of the arts, all of which led to the further spread of sin (Gn. 420% 111%); (c) the evident reproach joined to the beginning of the culture of the vine (Gn. 9°); and (d@) the beautiful representation everywhere made of the charm and simplicity of the pastoral life.
(6) The Judaean narrative clearly presents the prophetic idea of the covenant relation entered into between Yahweh and the people of Israel, with the circumstances leading up to the making of the covenant, the basis on which it was to rest, and its formal ratification (Ex. 19%” 24° 34°). We do not see the proof of the non-existence of this idea at this time in the assertion that the narratives (including that of E, cf. Ex. 20 and Dt. 5, and Ex. 24%) are legendary and self-contradictory, that the early writing prophets make no use of the conception, and that, conse- quently, we are to understand the entire covenant idea to be the result of prophetic teaching,t rather than one of its fundamental positions from the very beginning.
This question will come up again, but it is well at this point to observe with Giesebrecht (Die Geschichtlichkett d. Sinatbundes): (a) that while references to the fact of a Sinaitic covenant outside of JE are few and doubtful (e.g. 1 K. 19! 44, in which nna is probably a later insertion, cf. @; on Ho, 67 and 8! v, commentary zz Joc.) until Jeremiah’s time, this is not con- clusive that such a covenant was unknown; since (a) Hosea in chap. 1-3
* This work of ¢vansforming appears all the more clearly, if we understand with Paton (A/T. VIIL., Oct. 1904) that the real basis of these patriarchal stories is found in traditions concerning the relation and movements of the early tribes.

THE JUDAEAN NARRATIVE Ixxvii
plainly presents the fact of a covenant, although no name is used; (f) the pri- mary meaning of nv73 (cf. Val. Z4 W. XII. 1 ff, 224 ff., XIII. 245 ff.; Kratz- schmar, Die Bundesvorstellung im A. T.; K. DB. V. 6303; contra Schmidt, EB, 928 ff.) is covenant, agreement, the only way of putting a law into force being that of mutual agreement; (7) the lack of more frequent reference to the existence of the covenant is explained in part on the ground that no writ- ings from the older prophets have come down to us; in part, because few particular occasions called for such mention, and, besides, after the expiration of so long a period it was unnecessary to make allusion to the initial act, especially when, as history shows, every great change in the national situation was accompanied by a new pledge of Yahweh’s loyalty and love. Further- more, (4) the leaders, in their continuous effort to use the cultus as an example of the demands growing out of the covenant-relation, and at the same time to adapt the instruction to the changing needs of the people, emphasized the new relations, rather than the old covenant made by Moses. And if it is asked why should such emphasis have been placed on it in the days of Jere- miah, the answer is close at hand: Israel’s religion is preéminently an historical religion; the time had come when the covenant was to be broken; this fact necessarily brings the old covenant into great prominence. Concern- ing the relation of Amos and Hosea to this covenant-idea v.2.
(7) The prophetic element is seen still more strongly in the controlling place occupied in the narrative by the characteristic prophetic conception of sin and deliverance.* ‘This factor seems to underlie everything else, beginning, as it does, with the story of the origin of sin in Eden and the forecast of its struggle with humanity (p. lxxv), and continuing with each forward step in the progress of civilization, until because of its terrible growth the race itself (except a single family) must perish. Starting again in the new world, it reappears in the account of Noah’s vine-culture and in the scattering of the nations ; while the stories of the patriarchs, one after another, illustrate, for the most part, their deliverance by God’s grace from evil situations consequent upon sin ; and the national stories seem to be chronicles only of sin and deliverance from sin,—in other words, of disgraceful acts of rebellion and backsliding, and rescue from enemies who, because of such sin on Israel’s part, had temporarily become Israel’s masters.

(1) Yahweh, as a God who had controlled the affairs of human- ity, since he first brought humanity into existence; a God also who is celebrated for mercifulness and long-suffering, and for faithfulness (cf.

This life is intended to bring about the establish- ment of a holy people in the world (Gn. 18%*).
(4) A future mission zz the world (perhaps not yet 4 the world), where Israel is to be conspicuous by reason of the special privileges accorded. ‘These blessings will take the form of material pros- perity (cf. the spiritual gifts so great as to attract the envy of all nations, suggested later in Gn. 22”8 26* [R.]).
6. The place of the Judaean narrative in prophecy and its rela- tion to the later prophets may receive only a brief statement. (1) The ideas of Yahweh as just and hating sin, as merciful, and as faithful, are the very ideas afterward emphasized, respec- tively by Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah; the representation of him as all-powerful, and ever-present with his people, precedes Amos’s representation in chaps. 1, 2, and that of Isaiah’s Immanuel. (2) The conception of sin, and the statement of its evil effects, contain the very substance of all subsequent prophetic utterance. (3) The germ of the Messianic hope, here appearing, in later years is to occupy a large place in religious thought. (4) The concep- tion of Israel’s mission in the world ultimately develops into the doctrine of the servant of Yahweh.
Besides this, the more specific allusions to J which are found in Amos and Hosea may be noted, eg.: Am. 3’, cf. Gn. 18%;

§ 9. THe Epramire Narrative (E).
This narrative of Israel’s early history took form as early as 800 B.c., and, with the Judaean narrative already discussed, fur- nishes us a remarkable picture of the life and thought of the period.
1. Certain preliminary points concerning E require brief consideration : (1) The evidence of E’s Northern origin is found* in its interest in the sanctuaries of Northern Israel ; its assignment of the leadership in the Joseph story to Reuben (cf. J’s assignment of it to Judah); its giving of a conspicu- ous place o Joseph in Dt. 33, the account of his covenant with the tribes at Sheche and the interment of his bones at Shechem; the mention of the tombs of any prominent persons, especially those located in the North; some points of contact with Aramaic in its language; the prophetic spirit which breathes through it and is characteristic of the North, the home of prophecy. ¢
(2) The date of E is 800 B.c. to 750 B.c.{ The general historical situ- ation of the writers seems to be the same as in the case of J, namely, the period of the monarchy. But the general theological standpoint of E is unanimously conceded to be more advanced than that of J; e.g. the concep- tion of the deity is less anthropomorphic (cf. especially, Ex. 314); the idea of progress in revelation appears ; the whole representation of the method
 
* V. Carpenter and Battersby, Hex. 1. 116 f.; Dr. LOT, 122; Holzinger, Zzn/. 212 ff.
+ The oldest form of J has been assigned to the North by some scholars, e.g. Schra. in De Wette’s Zzz/.8 321; Reuss, Gesch. d. heil. Schriften d. A.T., § 213; Kue. Hex. 248 ff.; but this view does not commend itself.
{ That E was prior to J was the prevailing opinion until the appearance of We.'s Gesch. Isr. (1. 370 ff.) in which the opposite view was adopted, which is now gen- erally accepted. For the old view, v. Di. Num.-Dt.-Fos. 620 ff., 630 ff.; Kit. Hist. I. 76 ff. Kue. (Hex. 248-52) dates El about 750 and E# about 650 B.C.; so Co. Einl. 51. Sta. (GV/.1. 58 f.) places E about 750 B.C.,and maintains the possibility of additions to it after 722 B.C. (p. 582, note 1). Holzinger (Zzn/. 225 f.) puts E! in the latter half of the eighth century and E? early in the seventh century. Carpenter and Battersby assign E! to the first half of the eighth century, and “affirm that E, like J, contains elements of various date, some of which may have been contributed to it after it had been adopted into the record of history and law preserved in Judah”; similarly Steuernagel, Deuteronomium, etc., 282 f. Wildeboer puts El about 750 B.C. and E? somewhere before 621.
ixxxee iG INTRODUCTION
of the divine activity in the world is in the realm of the supernatural and superrational; the transcendent God makes known his will to men in dreams and visions and through angels, not by direct, personal speech as in J. Furthermore, in the case of stories common to J and E, not infrequently, the earlier form of the tradition is evidently that in J; eg. in Gn. 267% (J) and 212231 (E), according to E the covenant is binding upon posterity, the oath becomes one of exculpation, and seven lambs are introduced in an attempt to explain the origin of the name Beer-sheba (cf. also Gn. 301416 [J] with 30!7f [E],and 30% [J] with 30%[E]). For a terminus ad quem 722 B.C. is the lowest possible date, since nowhere in E is there any allusion to the overthrow of the state, which a Northern writer must have mentioned had he been through that experience. The same may safely be said of the events of 734 B.c. The whole character of E’s narrative reflects a period of prosperity such as the reign of Jeroboam II.; the tone is one of confidence and hope, with no consciousness of recent disasters nor premonitions of approaching misfortunes. The points of contact between Hosea and E (w.2.) also seem to point to the priority of the latter, and so confirm the assignment of E to the date 800-750 B.C.
(3) In comparing the scope of E with that of J, we observe (a) that in E the relation of Israel’s tradition to the outside world is altogether ignored, the barest allusion (e.g. Gn. 20% Jos. 24”) being made to the Mesopotamian antecedents of Abraham’s family ; but (4) the history of the family, and later of the nation, proceeds on lines quite parallel to those of J. The more inter- esting variations are (¢) the story of the intended sacrifice of Isaac (Gn. 22), the fuller statement of Jacob’s intercourse with Laban, the special attention given to the Joseph-episode, the very inde- pendent account of Moses and his times, as well as of the cere- mony at Horeb where the “ten words” are proclaimed and the covenant instituted, after which (Ex. 24*%) follow the reception of the tables of stone in the mountain and the apostasy of the golden calf. Out of this came the establishment of the tent of meeting (Ex. 33’"),* in connection with which certain events of important prophetic significance occur (the prophetic inspiration of the seventy elders, Nu. 11¥*, the vindication of Moses’ pe- culiar prophetic office, 12°). Thence the narrative passes on to the conquest and the distribution of the land and Joshua’s final
 
* F’s description of the tent of meeting has been omitted to make place for the more elaborate account of P.

leave-taking at Shechem (Jos. 24). The narrative unquestionably continues through Judges and Samuel,* thus reaching down at least into the early history of the monarchy, perhaps even to the Elisha stories in 2 Kings.t
(4) Zhe purpose of this narrative is evidently to magnify the office of the leaders, and these leaders are prophets, e.g. Abraham (Gn. 207), Isaac (Gn. 27%), Jacob (48%), Joseph (50%), and Moses (Nu. 12*”), to all of whom visions are granted of the future prosperity of the nation. Israel’s government is a theocracy, in which the prophets speak for God. When Israel has obeyed the theocratic representatives, she has always been the recipient of divine favor, which signified peace and plenty. When Israel dis- obeyed, the divine anger was visited upon her in the form of disaster. It is not the secular rulers upon whom her success depends, but the theocratic guides. This teaching, which the nar- rative throughout was intended to convey, is admirably summed up in Joshua’s farewell address (chap. 24).
2. The prophetic element in FE, as has been said, is most conspicuous ;{ and the narrative, for this reason, is of especial interest to us. We may recall the representation of Abraham as a prophet (Gn. 20’), the ascription to Joseph of the spirit of Elohim (Gn. 41*), the unique place in pre-prophetism assigned to Moses (Nu. 127"; cf. Dt. 34”), the treatment of Miriam as a prophetess (Ex. 15”), the recognition of the non-Israelitish Balaam as a prophet (Nu. 23°), the prophetic inspiration and authority accorded to the seventy elders (Nu. 117°?) the characteriza- tion of Joshua as the minister of Moses and the servant of Yahweh, the forecasts of Israel’s greatness made in the visions ascribed

+ It is important to separate E2, so far as possible, from El, for it is only the latter that preceded Hosea. Concerning the limits of E?, however, there is as yet little agreement, the exceedingly fragmentary character of E as a whole rendering it peculiarly difficult to determine definitely the different strata within the docu- ment. The more important passages assigned to E? are: Gn. 34 35!4 Ex. 321-336 Nu. rr4. 16 f. 240-30 7228 2732-85, and, by some, the Decalogue of Ex. 20 (but v.s.). Cf. Kue.

to dying patriarchs (Gn. 27° 46? 48”), the hero-stories which were pictures intended to serve as the ideals of the times in which the narratives were written, and, in fact, as anticipations or predictions of Israel’s future glory, and the general representation of theocratic guidance and control which is always present. In all this the prophetic element is pronounced. Furthermore, the emphasis of E upon ethical matters and everything pertaining to the impartial administration of justice is in keeping with its prophetic character ; cf. the large amount of legislation concern- ing the rights of individuals and their mutual responsibilities incor- porated in E, and especially the ethical character of E’s decalogue (p. lxi ff.) as compared with that of J, and the evident effort to remove from the old traditions everything detrimental to the repu- tation of the prophetic heroes. This ethical interest is in the direct line of the development of thought which culminates in Amos and the writing prophets. E possesses also a larger interest in priestly matters than J, but this is wholly subordinate in com- parison with his prophetic tendency.
3. The message of E* is after all quite distinct from that of J, although it contains very much, indeed, that is the same :- —
(1) The teaching concerning God is characterized by (@) a recognition of three different stages of growth through which the conception has passed, viz. that of Israel’s early ancestors, poly- theism (Jos. 24”), that of Abraham and Jacob, cf. the reformation instituted by the latter after seeing Elohim’s angels at Bethel (Gn. 3574), and that connected with the revelation of Yahweh (Ex. 3”); (4) the important place assigned to representatives (viz. prophetic spokesmen or angelic messengers Ex. 14”), as agents of the deity in his intercourse with the people, and to dreams as a method of communication, and the consequent absence of the crude, though picturesque, anthropomorphisms found in J; (c) the treatment of important events as the result, not of human effort in a natural way, but of the direct action of the deity (Ex. 17°" Jos. 6”), and in this same connection, the employment by the deity of men to accomplish his plans in spite of their igno- rance or hostility (Gn. 50” 45°) ; (d@) the use in connection with
 
* VY, especially Holzinger, Zin. 201-12,

the deity of certain peculiar forms and phrases, e.g. the plural of the verbal form (Gn. 20% 31% 357 Ex. 22° Jos. 24”), the phrase “fear of Isaac” (Gn. 31), the reference to the sacred stone (Gn. 28”), the pillar at the door of the tent speaking (Ex. 33°), the stone of witness (Jos. 24”), the “trying” of the people by the deity (Gn. 22").
The whole idea of God is more theological and abstract (cf. the new interpretation given the word 717", viz. 7°78 “WS ANTS) than is the casein J. E’s God is an exalted personality far removed from his people, and working almost entirely in the realm of the super- natural. He is a God of transcendent power and majesty and of unchanging purpose.
(2) Other characteristic elements in E’s message, already mentioned, may be briefly summarized as follows: (a) A keener ethical sense than J’s, as seen particularly in the evident desire to shield the reputation of the patriarchs by relieving them of the responsibility for certain transactions (e.g. Abraham expels Hagar only when commanded so to do (Gn. 211”), Jacob in his shrewd dealing with Laban is acting under the direct guidance of God (Gn. 3174 9. 42), (6) A very definite recognition of the patriarchal cultus, with its tent of meet- ing (Ex. 33’), placed under the charge of Joshua, rather than of Aaron and his sons (Nu. 111680), together with altars and pillars (Gn, 2818. #2 Ex, 244), but no priests. (c) An utter lack of interest in the outside world, or in the connection of Israel’s history with the outside world.
(3) E’s message, briefly stated, was this: Israel’s God isa being of wonderful majesty and exalted personality, with unlimited power. His purpose concerning the nation is unchanging. He is not close at hand to communicate with you in person, but makes known to you his will through definite agents, prophets, and messen- gers; there is no occasion to be ignorant of his wishes, which have been declared so clearly by these agents raised up to repre- sent him. History has shown conclusively that when the voice of these agents has deen heeded, the nation has had peace and pros- perity ; but when there has been rebellion against their injunc- tions, there have come ruin and disaster. In every important crisis of national history, Israel’s God has shown his interest by direct action on Israel’s behalf ; but he has never hesitated to send punishment when Israel deserved the same. Israel may learn how Yahweh would have the nation act, if attention is given to the lives
lxxxiv INTRODUCTION
of the old patriarchal ancestors and to the great events of early national history. These experiences of honor and glory will again be enjoyed, if only Israel will give heed to the lessons of the past, improve the standards of conduct, and worship Yahweh as did their ancestors.
4. The relation of E to other prophets is quite clear. It is more advanced and higher than J. In many points it is on a level with Amos and Hosea. It is like Hosea, rather than J and Amos, in showing little or no interest in the larger world-view. It is interesting to note that the broader conception is confined to the two documents of Judaean origin. E sees no such danger in the cult as is evidenced by Amos and Hosea. E’s thought of sin is that of J. While E’s ethical standards (cf. p. Ixxxiii) are higher than those of J, they do not reach the level on which those of Amos and Hosea rest.
In E we have the close of the pre-prophetic movement, for with Amos, as all agree, real prophecy has begun. We may now ask, what was the basis and character of this movement, taken as a whole?
B. THE BASIS AND CHARACTER OF THE PRE-PROPHETIC MOVEMENT.
§ 10. THE RELATION OF PRE-PROPHETISM TO MosalIsM.
The question of the connection of pre-prophetism with Mosaism is as interesting as itis difficult. Such connection is taken for granted in J and E (likewise in D).* But does this assumption stand the historical test ?{ The answer to this question bears most directly
 
* Both J and E narrate the circumstances of Moses’ work with great minuteness, and on all the main points there is a fair agreement. They unite in ascribing to him (1) leadership in the deliverance from Egypt and in the journey to Canaan; (2) the position as the representative of Yahweh to Israel; (3) the place as mediator in the making of a covenant between Yahweh and Israel; (4) the honor of founding Israel's legislation.
t Che. (ZB. art. “ Moses") makes the name Moses that of aclan; Wkl. (G/. II. 86-95) makes the entire Moses story a transformation of an original Tammuz myth; but the historicity of the narratives, in a greater or less degree, is maintained by Sta. GVI. 1. 130; We. Prol. 429-40; Sm. Rel. 15 ff.; Kit. Azst. I. 227-39; WRS. OT/C.2 303 ff.; Giesebrecht, Geschichil. d. Sinaibundes; Bennett, art. “ Moses,” DB&.; H. P. Smith, O. 7. Hist, 56 ff.; and many others.
THE RELATION OF PRE-PROPHETISM TO MOSAISM lxxxv
upon the estimate which we shall finally place upon the work of Amos ; for, in the fewest words, the case may thus be stated: Did the ethical idea which formed the essence of prophetic teaching have its origin in Amos? or is there clear trace of its existence before the days of Amos? Is it seen in the transforming work of J and E in their stories dealing with world-history and nation- history (v.s.)? Is evidence of its presence to be seen farther back, in the legal formulations found incorporated in J and E(w.s.)? Is it seen still earlier, in the motives and methods of Elijah, Elisha, and the mebhi’?m, whose work began in the days of the seer Samuel? And is the germ of it all to be discovered in Mosaism ?
If we are to reach a safe conclusion concerning Moses and his relation to the subsequent history of Israel and Israel’s religion, more, perhaps, is to be stated in the form of negation than in the form of affirmation. This is true, partly because so much that is unfounded has been affirmed, partly also because it is practically impossible to draw a sharp line between Mosaism and the pre- prophetic religion, or to trace with perfect satisfaction the relations between the two.
1. It may safely be said that the pre-prophetic religion, even if this includes Mosaism as its basis, has little to do with Egypt or Egyptism ; * while, on the other hand, its relation to the desert of Sinai (or Horeb), and to the tribe of which Jethro was priest is very close. This locality, according to all tradition, was the scene and source not only of Moses’ education, but also of the call from the deity, as well as of the work of Jethro, who became the guide (religious and secular) of Moses (and likewise his father-in-law) ; f and this, also, was the place, according to all tradition, in which Israel later entered into covenant with Yahweh (v.s.).
2. We must relinquish the conception (old and widely accepted as it may be) that Mosaism and the developments from it are identical, { an idea which has been the occasion of much error
 
* This is granted by those who hold to the Egyptian bondage, e.g. Sm. Rel. 2 37; Marti, Red. 55 f.; Schultz, Theol. 1. 127 ff.; Kue. Rel. 1. 275 ff.; and follows as a matter of course upon the adoption of the Musri hypothesis.

t Bennett (DZ. III. 446) rightly recognizes the necessity and the difficulty of making this distinction,
Ixxxvi INTRODUCTION
and confusion; but we may regard it as established that Moses represents historically (2) the deliverance of Israel from Egypt,* (4) the union of several clans into one community (perhaps not yet a nation),f and (¢) a new conception of deity expressed in, or in connection with, the word “Yahweh.” {
3. We are no longer to argue, @ priori, that the Moses of tradi- tion must have been just what the tradition represented him as being, for, on this basis, we cannot explain “the ethical impulse and tendency, which, at any rate from the time of the prophet Amos (and Amos, be it remembered, presupposes that this impulse is no novelty), is conspicuous in the history of the Israelitish reli- gion” (Cheyne); but we are entirely justified in believing that Moses was the founder of a religion, and “brought to his people a new creative idea (viz. the worship of Yahweh as a national God), which moulded their national life” (Stade, GVZ. I. 130; cf. Akad. Reden., 105 ff.).§
4. We may safely deny the ascription to Moses of literary work of any kind, even the songs with which his name is connected (e.g. Ex. 15! Dt. 32'* 337”), or the “judgments and precepts” of CC (§ 7), and the decalogues of E(Ex. 20), and of J (Ex. 34) ; ll but, without much question, we may hold him responsible for the institution of the tent of meeting as the dwelling-place of the deity, together with the ark, and the beginning of a priesthood, and this

§ Cf. We. (Prol.), “Moses was not the first discoverer of this faith (viz. that Yahweh is the God of Israel, and Israel the people of Yahweh), but it was through him that it came to be the fundamental basis of the national existence and history’; WRS. (OT/C2 305), ‘“ He founded in Israel the great principles of the moral reli- gion of the righteous Yahweh.” Co, (ist. of the People of Isr.) says of Moses’ work at Sinai, “It is one of the most remarkable moments in the history of man- kind, the birth hour of the religion of the spirit. In the thunderstorms of Sinai the God of revelation himself comes down upon the earth; here we have the dawn of the day which was to break upon the whole human race, and among the greatest mortals who ever walked this earth Moses will always remain one of the greatest.”
|| Moses was preéminently a man of affairs ; the strenuous nature of his activities as leader and organizer of the tribes of Israel left no opportunity for literary pur- suits. His work was “rather practical than didactic, the influence of an inspired life rather than the inculcation of abstract dogmas” (Bennett, DZ. IIT. 446).
THE RELATION OF PRE-PROPHETISM TO MOSAISM ILxxxvii
is the germ of much of the institutional element that follows in later years.
5. We may find greater or less difficulty in discovering the basis of an ethical development in Mosaism, either (@) in the essentially ethical character of the claim upon Israel, which grew out of the great act of mercy performed by Yahweh at the crossing of the Red Sea, Israel’s religion taking on gradually thereafter a mora: character, because she is constantly impelled to pay due regard to the claim ;* or (4) in the new conception of God, viz. that he controls nature and history, involving the truth that Yahweh was not the God of a country but of a people, the relation of a deity to a people being more spiritual than that of a deity to a country ;f or (c) in the mutual loyalty of the tribes to one another and their common loyalty to one God, in contrast with the individual heno- theism of Moab, Ammon, etc.
It is probable, on the other hand, that a more reasonable hy- pothesis will be found in the view { that this development has its roots in the fact that Israel’s relation to Yahweh was not that of blood-kindred, as in the case of nature religions, nor that simply of long observance which had become something inevitable ; but, rather, a relation entered into by choice, one which, unlike that of a nature religion, could be broken, but also one which Israel was led to preserve, because Yahweh had wrought great works in her behalf. Budde’s summary (p. 38) expresses this thought most exactly: “Israel’s religion became ethical because it was a religion of choice and not of nature, because it rested on a voluntary decision, which established an ethical relation between the people and its God for all time.”
6. We may acknowledge quite freely the insufficiency and uncertainty of the materials at our command, and, as well, the difficulty of giving proper credit to the various agents and move- ments concerned with the development of the great ethical ideas concerning righteousness, which had before been unknown ; but, at the same time, we cannot fail to recognize that certain facts

Ixxxviii INTRODUCTION
have been established which fit into hypotheses more or less satis- factory, the fundamental factor in which is the close logical and historical connection between pre-prophetism and Mosaism. In- deed, it may be asserted that Mosaism is as fundamental to pre- prophetism as is pre-prophetism to prophetism itself.
§ 11. Tue EssENTIAL THOUGHT OF PRE-PROPHETISM.
Is it possible now to think of this movement in its unity, and, in spite of the many difficulties which exist, to separate and dis- tinguish its thought from that which precedes and follows it? In making the effort to draw historical lines, we may observe : (1) That the case before us is, in some sense, a definite one, since we are concerned with Israel’s religious thought during the period in which VYahwism is in contact with Baalism as a rival religion. This contact began when Israel entered Canaan ; it ended in the century in which Jehu, under the influence of the xedhz’tm, up- rooted it.* We might go farther and say that we are dealing with Yahwism itself; for, pure Yahwism, at the end of this period, passes into prophetism, which, still later, becomes Judaism. (2) Consequently, our question is a threefold one: What was Yahwism at the time of the entrance into Canaan? With what did Yahwism have to contend in the centuries from 1100 to 800 B.c.? What had Yahwism become at the close of the con- test? Two or three subsidiary questions will arise, viz.: How was it that, in the end, Yahwism became supreme? Is the differ- ence between the Yahwism of 1100 B.c. and that of 800 B.c. the sum contributed by the xedhi’im ? or did Yahwism draw from Baalism itself much that was of vital significance? And further, were the institutions of Baalism made use of by Yahwism in securing this position of superiority?
1. It is natural to consider first the idea of God.
(1) When Yahwism, whatever may have been its origin,f came
 
* The effects of Baalism continue down to Hosea and later; some of them are, indeed, incorporated in Yahwism (w.z.).
+ Whether, e.g. (1) in an original direct revelation (so most old interpreters) ; (2) in the old Arabian tribal religion (Schultz, e¢ a/.); (3) in the religion of the Kenites (Stade, Budde, e¢ a/.); or (4) in the esoteric monotheism of the Egyptian priesthood.
THE ESSENTIAL THOUGHT OF PRE-PROPHETISM 1xxxix
into Canaan, it was, so far as the conception of God was concerned, simple and primitive, very crude and naive, monotonous and severe.
This appears in (a) the conception of Yahweh as the god of the mountain (Sinai), a conception which continued in one form or another until late in Israel’s history (Dt. 332% 1 K. 198 Ps. 688 Hb. 38). (4) The more widely prevailing conception of Yahweh as the god of war, an idea which found strong justification in the issue of the contest with Egypt (cf. also, the war- song with which camp was broken, Nu. 10%), as well as that with the Canaanites (cf. the fear of the Philistines, 1 S. 47", on account of Yahweh’s presence in the ark). This is seen also in the allusion to Israel’s armies as Yahweh’s armies (1 S. 1726 2528), and in the very name, Yahweh Sabaoth (cf. 2 S. 52°).* (c) The conception of him also as the God of the desert (z.e. of the nomad), and especially in connection with storms, ¢.g. at the giving of the law (Ex. 19), in the battle of Deborah (Ju. 54°), in the storm exhibited to Elijah at Horeb (1 K. 19!) #-), and in later times, v.s. It is here that the nomadic temperament of pre-prophetism (v.s.) finds its basis.t (@) The conception of the ark, a materialistic symbol of Yahweh’s presence, which plays a great rdle in this early period, } actually representing Yahweh, and not merely containing some image or symbolic stone. The history of its presence or absence in Israel’s armies, its transportation hither and thither until at last it is deposited in the Temple (1 K. 84°), is full of significance in showing the crude and crass conceptions of deity entertained, not only by the people, but also by the leaders.
(e) The use of images, involving family and clan conceptions of deity, distinct from that of Yahweh.§ Some of these images, unquestionably, were employed to represent Yahweh, e.g. the 5ps, originally of wood or stone, and probably of human form (Ju. 17f), || likewise, the »x(p. 221), perhaps origi- nally the garment used to clothe the image, and later, the image itself, and used in obtaining oracles, But the zeraphim (p. 222), used very frequently of Yahweh, are also images of ancestors, of the tribal or family gods, as in the case of Rachel (Gn. 311% %f cf, 9-32), and of the king of Babylon (Ez. 2176). It is understood that all of these usages existed in the earliest times of the pre- prophetic period. pene rile ee eee teers 2 ty eee

XC INTRODUCTION
(2) What, now, did Israel find in Canaan that required to be either assimilated or destroyed? To what extent, and through what means, in the course of the struggle was Yahwism itself modified?
(a) The distribution of the clans among the Canaanites in- volved a serious risk, for they now acted more or less independently of each other, and much that had been gained by their union was lost. With Canaanites on every side of them, they were com- pelled to give a certain recognition to the gods of the people, who were, likewise, the gods of the land; and especially was this true in view of the fact that they were unable to drive out the Canaanites, but lived with them side by side (Ju. 1° 18'*). How could they do other than express gratitude to the Baalim, z.e. the gods of the land, for the fruits which they gave?
(4) The new life, moreover, was an agricultural rather than a nomadic life, and demanded many modifications. The Israelites were the pupils of the Canaanites in all “the finer arts of field and vine culture,” and the association needed for this could not fail to exert a great influence on Israel’s life and thought.*
(c) The nation for the first time came into touch with real civilization, and civilization was for them identical with Baalism. This explains why the zeAz’2m tended toward an isolated life, and seem in most cases to have opposed all progress toward civilization. The emblems of civilization, corn and oil, silver and gold, Israel believed, came from the Baalim (Ho. 2°).
(d) The nature of Baalism itself was something peculiarly attractive to people of a sensuous type. The great emphasis placed on reproduction and everything connected with it, whether in the realm of vegetable or animal or human life, gave it a per- vasive influence, for all life in the narrower, if not in the broader, sense was involved. The strength of the ideas thus included is evident from the hold they took upon many nations of ancient times. There was a stimulus in all this, a warmth which, although greatly abused, produced also some good results.
(3) What actually occurred in the process of this long struggle was as follows: (@) Yahweh’s residence is changed; he gradually

takes up his dwelling in the new territory. This means that the Baalim whom men worshipped at many different points, under vari- ous names, Baal-Peor, Baal-Hermon, etc. (cf. also Baal-Berith, Bzal-Zebub), were displaced by Yahweh, who was worshipped at all the sacred places and bore different names according to the place (e.g. ndw 5x, the eternal God, Gn. 21%; 5x-mn 5x, the God of Bethel, 31% 357; mbw ”, Yahweh Shalom, Ju. 6%, etc.). All this change has taken place before the times of J and E, for, as Kautzsch points out (DZ. V. 646), the patriarchal narratives do not know of any Baal-worship in the land. Yahweh has taken Baal’s place, but in so doing the Yahweh ritual has absorbed so much of Baalism as to become, practically, a Baal ritual. (6) The idea grows that Yahweh “is enthroned as God in heaven.” This means much, for it implies that he is superior to all other gods. It is from heaven that he performs all those acts which indicate his power over the elements (¢.g. rain, dew, fire, Gn. 19%) and over the fruits of the soil. He is called the God of heaven (Gn. 24"). Messengers must now be employed to represent him, and these angels call from heaven (21” 22”), and, indeed, go up and down on ladders which unite heaven and earth (28”), the ‘house of God” being identical with the “gate of heaven.” (c¢) His nature as the God of the desert is changed ; he is no longer hos- tile to civilization. Yahwism could never have become without change the religion of a civilized people, still less of humanity. “ He takes under his protection every new advance in civilization.” * (2) His nature as destroyer (war-god) is changed, for he is no longer the deity of desolation and silence. He is in continual touch with man’s activity, and everything is subordinated to secure his influence and blessing. The idea of beneficence and love has come. Warmth and color now exist, where all before was cold and stern. (¢) Baalism, acting as a “decomposing reagent,” brings unity, solidarity, in so far as like conditions exist, and thereby all cult and family images must disappear. Hence arises the oppo- sition to image-worship which forms so large an element in prophetism beginning with Hosea. (/) Attempts are made to spiritualize the old physical conception of Yahweh. Among these

are to be counted (a) the expression, “angel of Yahweh” (J), which was at first used when Yahweh was represented as coming into contact with man (Gn. 16’* cf. 4); in other words, a method of Yahweh’s manifestation ; * (9) the face of Yahweh (J), z.e. the person (Ex. 33”), but not the full being,t and (y) the name of Yahweh (Ex. 20% 23”), in which “ name” is a “ personified power, placed side by side with the proper person of Yahweh.” { The use of these phrases§ is an attempt to substitute something more spiritual for the thought of the human form, and marks great progress in the conception of God.
(4) The agencies which bring about this change are in part: (a) Those of the old Yahwism, the strength of which continues to be felt in spite of the additions that have been taken on ; (4) those also of Baalism, among the chief of which was prophetism, adopted and adapted by Israel (v.s.); but (¢) the immediate occasion of the acute attack which enabled Yahwism to throw off the gradu- ally increasing burden that had almost proved its ruin, was the attempt to force upon Israel a new form of this same Baalism, that of Tyre. The situation was now essentially different from that which existed in the early days of the conquest; for at this time Yahweh had actually taken possession of the land, and the question was: Shall a foreign god, the deity of Tyre, who has already shown great power, come in and overpower the god of the land, who is now Yahweh? || On the nature of this struggle in detail, v.z. The old Baalism had become so intimate a part of Yahwism that at this time it is lost sight of in the new Baalism which threatens Israel. This distinction makes clear what at first seems contradictory, viz. the idea that Baalism was actually uprooted by Jehu, and the idea, which also existed, that Baalism was still a corrupting element in Israel’s religion.
(5) At the close of the struggle, Yahwism is victorious ; | the conception of God which has now developed being as follows :

§ The phrase “glory of Yahweh” probably arose in this period, but there is no certain evidence of its existence until a slightly later date; cf. 1 S. 422 Ex. 331* (late J) Nu. 1422 (JE). || K. DB. V. 647. {I Bu. Rel. 106.

(2) Yahweh is a god irresistible in nature and among nations, the idea of a merely national god having been outgrown. This is seen in the power attributed to Yahweh over other nations, ¢.g. Egypt, and Canaan, as well as in the extra-national existence involved in his residence at Sinai, and likewise in the later conception of a heavenly residence (v.s.). The narrower idea of Yahweh as the god of a land has never existed. He has been and is a national god, z.e. Israel’s God ; but he is also something more than this, a god who controls nations and nature in Israel’s favor. It is not in this same sense that we may speak of Chemosh or Ashur.
(4) He is, moreover, a god who is the moral ruler of his people ; this has not gone so far as to affect individuals, being still limited to families and nations. The interests of the individual are indeed conceived of as under the protection of Yahweh, but they are wholly subordinate to those of the nation, being in themselves of too slight importance to merit the especial and continuous con- sideration of the deity, except in so far as they contribute to the national life and progress.* Yahweh’s rule is characterized by jus- tice, and his power to judge extends to heaven and to Sheol. Here we must estimate the true character of judgment in ancient times, for, although it came from Yahweh, it signified, not a “moral inves- tigation and instruction,” but “an oracular response obtained by means of a sacred lot” (Ex. 22°* Jos, 76 8 7S, 14).f This, as Budde says, is not moral, but intellectual knowledge. But this primitive judgment has nevertheless given place to the verdict against kings pronounced by Nathan and Elijah (v.s.).
He is known for his personal interest and love, since he has shown himself to be, not only a helper and a friend, but, indeed, a father.{ This signifies something very great, for he is no longer simply a natural or even national god, and therefore compelled to render such service. If deliverances have been wrought, they have come through his affection. There is a sense, likewise, in which he is a oly god, and disobedience of his regulations is szz. This is implied in the claim of Elijah, who treats allegiance to any other god as sin ; in representations of J and E, that disregard of Yahweh’s will (cf. especially the story of the origin and progress of

Xciv INTRODUCTION
sin given by J in Gn. 3-11) is deserving of severe punishment and inevitably followed by judgment ; in the decalogues, which present the ethical and the ritualistic demands of a god, himself holy, and therefore demanding an elevated character in those who serve him ; and in CC, the regulations of which are everywhere regarded as the expression of the divine will.
(c) Yahweh alone is the God of Israel, and he only may be worshipped, — this was the truth for which Elijah had contended, and his contest had been won. The significance of this victory can scarcely be overestimated. The fact that Yahweh had made and enforced such a demand in itself challenged attention. It emphasized the fundamental and far-reaching difference between Yahweh and the nature gods of Canaan and the surrounding peoples.* This difference consisted chiefly in the essentially ethical and spiritual nature of Yahweh, which must of necessity find expression in demands upon his people for a worship arising from the heart and a life devoted to ideals of justice and purity.
2. In what has already been said, there is much that refers to the conceptions concerning man’s duty to God, as expressed in worship. We may add the following brief statement : —
(1) The priest, hardly known before the entrance into Canaan, has attained an important place. The story of the priest-work of Micah (Ju. 17, 18), and that of Eli and his sons (1 S. 11-4”), shed much light upon the early history of the priesthood. He was at first occupied with the care of the Ark (1S. At i2:S.cr5*) and with carrying or consulting the ephod (for no positive evidence exists that the priests participated in sacrifice +). Out of this function grew later the giving of directions, i.e. térdth, in matters relating to law or ritual. But with the erection of the Temple, the priests took on larger service and rose to a higher place in society and in governmental affairs. Strong societies were organized, at first in Jerusalem, and later in Northern Israel (cieDi 33°S7, By, in which the priesthood is recognized as organized and as possess- ing high dignity and power). At the same time CC contains no reference to a priest ; the whole matter is custom, not law.
(2) The high places taken over from Baalism are still employed
 
* Cf. Kue. Rel. 1. 367 f. + 1S. 212 ff does not prove this.
THE ESSENTIAL THOUGHT OF PRE-PROPHETISM XCV
without objection as the seats of popular worship. These repre- sent the ancient holy places, and have now become thoroughly identified with Yahweh-worship, as distinguished from Baal-wor- ship. The thought has not yet been suggested that worship shall be restricted to one place, Jerusalem. The impossibility of secur- ing a pure worship at these high places has not yet been realized.
(3) Sacrifice is, after all, the chief feature of worship. It appears in the meal of communion (1 §S, 14 ff: gl2 #.); the offerer may kill the victim, the fat is reserved for Yahweh, and a portion is given to the priest (1 S. 213f); the flesh may not be eaten with the blood (1 S. 14°f), All sacrifices are gifts to the deity; the offerings of Gideon (Jju. 68) and Manoah (Ju. 1 3}®) represent the usage of the times.*
(4) The passover, Israel’s only festival in pre-Canaanitish times, has now grown into several, among which are (2) the Sabbath (Ex. 3471 2312 Dt. 512), observed, however, with a humanitarian rather than a religious motive (v.s.) ; this same thing holds good also of (4) the seventh year, which is beginning to be observed. There are also (¢) the new moon (1 S, 205 ff. 4 #.), with festivities lasting for two days, and (@) the three festivals at which all males were to appear with gifts (Ex. 234 3418); these were occasions of great joy and feasting, reaching even to excess, for sacred women at the high places prostituted themselves as a part of the religious ritual. Cf. Amos and Hosea passim.t ;
(5) Custom has now in many cases been codified into law, for CC is clearly in existence (v.s,), These precedents are now recognized as having divine sanction ; and while their scope is not broad, the essential content includes reference to many of the more important of the religious institutions,
(6) The use of images continues, and oracles are consulted in order to ascertain the divine will. This was the use made of Urim and Thummim, which, in some way not quite clear, represented the sacred lot. Cf. 1 S, 1441 (G), and 143-1836, + This usage, hardly consistent with a later and higher prophetism, was still a part of the system in vogue, and entirely consistent with that system.
3. It is not easy to formulate, as the expression of this Canaan- itish-Israelitish age, the opinion which prevailed concerning the relation of man to his fellow-man, his obligations, or, in other

words, the ethical standards which were in vogue. But certain things may be said, partly in the way of explanation, partly, also, in the way of interpretation :—
(1) It is unfair to the age, and to the subject, to base one’s con- clusions on the extreme cases of immorality. Such cases occur in our own day. The record of such cases (¢.g. that of Judah and Tamar (Gn. 38), and that of David and Bathsheba (1 Sam. 11, 12)) is evidence, not of their common occurrence, but of their heinous- ness in the sight of the prophet who makes the record.
(2) While we may still hesitate concerning the actual basis of this ethical movement in Israel’s history, and its origin, it is com- paratively easy to point out, not only the elements in the remarkable growth which has taken place in this period, but also the occasion of the growth, viz. the advance in a true conception of Yahweh (pp. xc ff.).
(3) The conception of higher ideals is still restricted to the community (¢.e. the family or clan), and has not received appli- cation to the individual.
(4) This higher conception has influenced the attitude of Israel neither toward outside nations, nor, indeed, toward the stranger inside Israel’s gates. This is not to be regarded as strange in view of the definitely hostile relations which existed for the most part between every ancient nation and its neighboring nations. Inter- national comity and law must follow national law at a long distance.
(5) Custom is still, in great measure, the standard of action, but this is more and more influenced by religious thought. And, as already suggested, custom has now been formulated into law. Crime is regarded as affecting Yahweh himself (2 S. 12", following the reading of Lucian), and the enactments of CC, aside from its ritual content, take cognizance of the most common and important of the human relationships.
(6) The later decalogue, properly interpreted (v.s.), marks the stage of advancement now reached. This is splendidly sup- ported and, indeed, developed in CC (pp. lxiv ff.).
(7) But, after all, the stories of the patriarchs give us the truest idea of the morals of the period.* They represent the highest ideals
ce mnenRRE SEE Ne Slo a eee es

of the teachers of Israel at the time they assumed literary form (cf. pp. lxxi, Ixxix f.). Abraham is the type of the truly pious Israelite, exhibiting the qualities of faith and obedience under the most try- ing circumstances ; while Jacob is the successful man of affairs, whose prosperity is due, not alone to his own shrewdness, but also to his faithful adherence to his God. The moral delinquencies of the patriarchs must be estimated in view of (a) the fact that in large part the questionable transactions are in relations with foreigners, toward whom ethical requirements did not hold to such a high degree (z.5.) ; (4) the effort of E to minimize the faults of the patriarchs (v.s.), which shows an ethical advance toward the close of the pre-prophetic period 3 (¢) the indirect condemnation some- times found within the stories themselves (cf. Gn. 20°F 26°F 271%),
(8) The stories of the kings enforce similar truths upon the attention. The special position of the king as “the anointed of Yahweh” and the most powerful personage in the nation added emphasis to the use of his life-story for purposes of moral and religious instruction. If David and his successors could achieve success only in so far as they obeyed Yahweh and refrained from evil, how much less could the nation at large disregard Yahweh’s will and prosper? The direct teaching of these stories is evident.
4. Aside from the conceptions already considered, viz. those of God, of man in relation to God, and of man in relation to man, there are certain others with which the religious and ethical ideas are closely associated. These possess more of the speculative character and deal with the origins of things and the future.*
(1) Ldeas concerning the origin and nature of man had taken on quite definite form, e.g. (a) the body of man (Gn. 27) is of earth and at death returns to the earth (Gn. 3”) ; while the breath (v.2.) is re-absorbed in the great Spirit of the universe ; this body or flesh is transitory in its nature (cf. Is, 31°) and always sub- ject to decay and destruction ; it is, moreover, the occasion of moral weakness ; but it is never represented as in itself sinful (az; as equivalent to odépé) and unclean.
(4) The dood is the life only in the sense that it is the source,
 
* Di. Theol. 355 ff.; the recent statement of Kautzsch (DB. VY. 665 ff.) furs nishes an admirable survey of this entire field.
xcviii : INTRODUCTION
or vehicle, or seat, of life ; consequently it must not be eaten (1 S.14”* ; cf. Dt. 123 Lv. 17"), for in so doing another life might be absorbed. The desire to bring about just such an identification of different lives was the basis of the earlier sacrificial meals, of which, however, no instance occurs in O.T. literature. The sig- nificance of this conception of blood upon the later development of sacrifice is very evident.
(c) The breath or spirit (m7) occupied a still larger place in the older thought. This dreath represented life, and had its origin in the breath of Yahweh himself, which he breathed into the first man (Gn. 27). When this divine breath (the spirit of life) is called back by Yahweh to himself (z.e. re-absorbed), death ensues. Nor was this spirit restricted to human beings, for animal life (Gn. 2") had the same origin (Nu. 16” 2 W6; cf. Ps. 104” £ Jb. 34/**), although it was reckoned inferior, as is shown by the fact that man was treated more directly and individually in the act of creation, animals being animated, so to speak, as a species ; and further, although animals are represented as created for man’s use, none of them is fit to be his “help.” But now, this spirit, breathed into humanity once for all in the case of the first man (= traducianism, rather than creationism), and including life of every kind, viz. thought, will, and action, is everywhere a manifestation of the divine spirit (cf. Acts 17).*
(2) The origin and purpose of the universe does not occupy 4 large place in Hebrew pre-prophetic thought, and yet certain defi- nite ideas are contained in J’s statement in Gn. 2** Perhaps something also is to be learned from what this passage does mo? con- tain (e.g. the lack of any mythical element). (a) This narrative, of which a portion (dealing with the creation of heaven and earth) doubtless has been lost, clearly points to Yahweh as the former of man and of man’s home (but this is only what other religious cosmogonies have done, each in its own way, and does not contra- dict the position that the doctrine of Yahweh as Creator is exilic or post-exilic, z.e. subsequent to the acceptance of monotheism).}

(4) The interest is centred in man, for whose benefit alone the animals are formed ; and when no suitable companion is found for him among them, woman is created by another and different pro- cess ; while (¢) the climax is found in the representation concern- ing marriage.*
(3) The origin and nature of sin is pictured in the story of the Jali, for no other interpretation than that of a Jallt will satisfy the demands. Concerning all this, it was believed (a) that man, at one time, lived in close association and communion with the deity ; but (4) pride led him to overstep certain bounds that had been set; (c) this act of disobedience was followed by trouble, misery, and suffering. ¢
(4) The state after death is a subject concerning which neither pre-prophecy nor prophecy had much to say, partly because the saying of anything would give encouragement to the superstitious survivals of animism, and partly, also, because no adequate teach- ing had as yet been worked out. That the ideas which prevailed in early Israel concerning Sheol came from the Canaanites (and perhaps farther back from Babylon) is probable; in any case, the popular belief was closely associated with necromancy, and conse- quently opposed to Yahwism. This belief (Gn. 37° 42% 44% Nu. 16” * for which we are indebted to J) included, at least, the following points: (a) Sheol is a space to which one goes down, (4) no one ever returns ; yet (c) by the influence of necromancers a “form” may be brought up, as in the case of Samuel (1 S. 28" 29 8 while (¢) only thick darkness prevails. (e) It is a place of assem- bly for the departed ; but (/) there is no such thing as fellowship (Gn. 37”). (g) That which goes down is not the body (which decays in the grave), nor the spirit (which is absorbed by the spirit of God) ; but “an indefinable something of the personality” which (= shade, or manes) is invisible and does not live, but merely

exists. How far this popular belief was a survival of animism, and the extent to which it was really antagonized by Yahwism, cannot here be discussed.*
s. The general character of the pre-prophetic movement may now be briefly summarized in view of its history up to this point, and, likewise, in view of the real prophetic activity which is to grow out of it and, at the same time, to follow close upon its heels :
(1) This movement is not exclusively or essentially Israelitish, but is of Canaanitish origin, + although itself at a later time hostile to Canaanitism and directly responsible for its destruction ; and in the long process of its growth it incorporates many Canaanitish ideas.
(2) The struggle between pre-prophetism and Baalism is between the later idea of a relation with the deity, based upon a pact or covenant, and the earlier idea of a relation based upon the natu- ral tie. In this case, the covenant idea lives and works several centuries with the nature idea, and, in the end, shakes it off, but only after absorbing all that was good in it.
(3) The result of the movement, in so far as it concerns worship, is the endurance, if not the acceptance, of an elaborated cult, through which the religious sentiment has been enlarged and enriched, but in which Israel is soon to find that which will prove her ruin (cf. Judah and the doctrine of the inviolable Jerusalem).
(4) The influence of the movement on conduct has been to raise the standard in a marked degree, and to define more closely the relations of man to man, without, however, going outside of Israel, or developing anything higher than that which pertains to the tribe or family.
(5) The movement, in so far as it concerns the idea of God, is still henotheistic, not monotheistic.

This may be accepted, notwithstanding (@) his seeming absorption in Northern Israel (cf. p. cxxi for the view that he always had Judah in mind as the home of Yahweh’s religion in the future); * (4) the elevation of Tekoa, which is alleged to be too great for sycamore culture (p. 3);¢ (c) the lack of allusion to Judah in his writings; t (@) the effort of Gratz$ to identify Tekoa with Eltekeh of Jos. 1944, making hima Danite; (e) the suggestion of Oort that he really lived in the North, and went to Judah only after his expulsion from Bethel (p. 3); (/) the desire of Che. || to transfer Tekoa to the Negeb, and transform many of the proper names in such a way as to place the entire activity of Amos in this region, which Che. supposes to have be- longed to Northern Israel,
The location of Tekoa in the desert of Judah furnishes the possibility of just such a sense of natural grandeur J as we are compelled to believe must have been the privilege through many years of one who was later able to express himself as did Amos. Nor may we deny the very great importance of the not far distant Arab influences, including the stimulating effect of the caravan routes close at hand (cf. the Dedanites, Is. 2118), although we may hesitate to see ** an actual Arabic idiom in o>. »av oy (42°), or to regard Tekoa tf as a great Arab-Israelitish literary centre, the Book of Job likewise having been written here, or to believe that the inhabitants of this general region, under the lead of the Jerahmeelites, were the occasion of all ancient Israelitish life and activity. ¢t
There is nothing in 3"* to show, as Cheyne thinks, that Amos must have left Tekoa before receiving his call. Here, almost within sight of Jerusalem, in or near a village fortified at one time by Rehoboam (2 Ch. 11°), and celebrated for the visit paid to David (2 S.14?™) by one of its wise women, which looked out upon a desolate, dreary, and savage world, in fact “an unmitigated wilderness,” in an environment abounding in emptiness and still- ness, was very naturally developed the being who was to possess, in fullest measure, the power of observation and reflection, the austere habits of the recluse, and the unpitying sharpness of the censor of his country’s faults and vices. §§ No mention is made of a father, or of family. Did he have no family record ?

2. But if this was the home of Amos, when and under what circumstances did he occupy it and do his work? We may not accept (1) the view recently suggested * that the book is subse- quent to the exile, later even than Joel; nor (2) its assignment to the date 744 or 745 B.c.,f on the ground that Assyria was inactive for twenty-five years previous to the accession of Tiglathpileser ITI. (745 B.c.); nor (3) the date indicated by Elhorst, viz. in the days of Josiah, 638-621.
Students of Amos are all but unanimous in agreeing that Amos delivered these sermons between 765 and 750 B.C. (p. 5). 4 This view assumes the general accuracy of the statements made in chap. 7, and is in strict accord with the circumstances of this period as they are elsewhere found to exist. §
(a) The freedom of the people from anxiety on account of Assyria, and the vagueness of Amos in referring to Assyria || (527 6!4) are both clear, when we note that during the reigns of Shalmaneser ITI. (783-773 B.C.), who was all the time engaged with the people of Urartu (i.e, Ararat), and ASur-dan (772-755 B.C.), whose time was occupied principally in dealing with con- spiracy and revolt at home, ample opportunity was afforded for the growth of Israel, and the political situation was one which gave the people great confidence.

* Edward Day and Walter H. Chapin, 4/SL. XVIII. 66-93. This argument is based on (1) the presence of many insertions generally acknowledged to be from a later hand, but these in nearly every case plainly interrupt the thought and fail to harmonize with the main portion, and this difficulty is not relieved by making the main portion also late; (2) the presence in the genuine Amos portions of many words and phrases which are “late,” and yet words are called “late” by these authors which are found in the Song of Deborah (Ju. 5), or the Blessing of Jacob (Gn. 49); (3) the general post-exilic tone of these supposedly original parts, but since this same post-exilic tone is said to characterize all of Isaiah as well as Hosea, the whole question is begged. The vagueness of the utterances of Amos, here used as evidence against the early date, is precisely the strongest possible evidence for that date.

(4) The religious situation is most intense. The keenest possible interest is taken in the cultus. The zeal of the worshippers attracts attention. The service is full and rich (44>: 5223 814 9!). This is due, on the one hand, to the satisfaction with which the people regard the peace and prosperity they now enjoy since the wars with Syria have closed, and to the joy and gladness with which they hail the enlargement of the nation’s territory; and on the other, to the anxiety aroused by earthquakes and pestilences (v.z.), the melancholy recollection of the treatment recently accorded them by the Syrians and Am- monites (13-18 4611), as well as the fear that, unless worshipped in this gor- geous fashion, Yahweh will bring back the troubles through which they have recently passed.
(c) The social situation is one in which the wealthy (and in these days of economic changes the number of the wealthy was large) are luxurious and given to debauchery (3!2 5!4), cruel and oppressive (26* 3!°), the women tak- ing their full share (4}, cf. Is. 31°). Ivory houses (3!) and continual feasting (64) furnish one picture; robbery, adultery, and murder (Ho. 4!18f 71.4f), another; while the lack of brotherliness and the prevalence of injustice (57-10. 2 612 84f) give still a third.
We cannot urge in favor of this date the interpretation of 6% suggested by We. and adopted by Che. (Z&. 149), that the people are rejoicing because of the capture of two cities in Gilead, Lo-debar and Karnaim (p. 156); but, at the same time, we do not find evidence against this date in 15, because in 2 K. 16° the fulfilment is represented as literally taking place; Kir here is probably an interpolation,* while Kir of 15 was perhaps suggested by the tra- dition regarding Aram’s origin (97), no stress being placed upon the locality of the captivity. Nor is a correct interpretation of 6? (p. 144) opposed to this date. The conquest of Gath by Uzziah (2 Ch. 268; cf. 6? and the absence of any mention of Gath in 18), the overthrow of Moab by Jehosha- phat (2 K. 3; cf. use of wpw rather than 7>p in Am. 2%), as well as that of Aram (2 K. 14%), seem to be presupposed.
Still further, notice may be taken of (d@) the pestilences which prevailed in Assyria in 765 and 759 B.C., to which allusion, possibly, is made in 4”, although it is there styled “after the manner of Egypt”; (e¢) the solar eclipse referred to in 89, assigned by the Assyrian eponym list to 763 B.c.; t (/) the earthquake (1}); this was the earthquake spoken of much later in Zc. 144 (where the mention of it is possibly due to this superscription; cf. the statement of
 
Erini (ze. Mt. Amanus, near the Gulf of Antioch) ; in 773, to Damascus; in 772, to Hadrach; in 765, again to Hadrach; in 755, a third time to Hadrach; in 754, to Arpad; and not again till 74s. Syria, thus, was engaged with Assyria, Israel was let alone, and in consequence Jeroboam II. and Uzziah were enabled to build up their kingdoms to a higher point than ever before.

Josephus, Anz. IX. 10, 4), and seemingly referred to in 41 as well as in 88 (not an interpolation, as We., Now., Elh., Che., maintain).* We cannot deny the occurrence of this earthquake, even though no other evidence for it is to be discovered. With the tradition thus substantiated, and with the recognition of the earthquake as a method of divine punishment found in 44 Is. 298, we may well accept the truth of the assertion, although, it is to be conceded, no help is gained from it for the more definite determination of Amos’s date.
3. In the case of no other prophet is the question of occupation more interesting, since with this there stands closely connected the problem of Amos’s preparation for his life-work. Four items require to be considered: (1) The prophet’s own statement (7) that he was not a prophet by profession, nor a member of one of the pre-prophetic societies. This implies that he does not wish to be reckoned as one of the nebhz’im, “the ecstatic enthusiasts,” the crowd of diviners, who in recent years had come to have a defi- nitely recognized professional position ; and, besides that, since he is not one of them nominally, his work is characterized by a pur- pose and spirit different from theirs. What was this? I answer, that spirit of observation and recognition of general law, of philosophical insight and reasoning, which became the so-called wisdom-spirit when nationalism had passed away and the doctrine of individualism was beginning to assert itself. Amos, as it will be seen, is almost as much a sage as he is a prophet. He differs from the later sages in still being, like the ebhz’im, limited to a point of view which is largely national ; but inside of his circle he exhibits the mood, the method, and the motive of the sage (v.2.). With this point in mind, it is easier to understand the other facts men- tioned in the same passage (7“). (2) The prophet’s real occupa- tion was that of a “dresser of sycamores.” This was a humble employment, and proves that Amos, like Micah, was one of the people. The evidence at hand does not clearly indicate whether he was really poor, or, perhaps, fairly well-to-do. Did he own a plantation of sycamores?+ In any case he was independent Se REE Di tLe Sata REEMA nM Tw Na SS ee
* Nothing could be more fanciful than G. Hoffmann’s suggestion (ZA W. III. 123, approved by Che. #2.149; Marti), that the remark in 1) is an inference of the editor, based upon the understanding that, according to 73-8 (cf, 78 82), Israel's
punishment had been delayed twice, for a year each time. t So Che, ZZ, 148,

enough to leave home. Or was he a dresser of sycamores in Northern Israel? and did he give up that occupation when driven out by Amaziah? This bears upon the place of his home as well as the character of his occupation (v.z.)._ It is immaterial whether Amos was a dresser or tender of the tree (p. 172), a collector and seller of the fruit,* or a pincher or scraper of the fruit, to insure a more rapid ripening.t We do not find in this occupa- tion anything inconsistent { with his Southern origin.
(3) The further statement that he was a shepherd, and had been taken by Yahweh from following the flock (cf. Elijah’s call of Elisha), is entirely con- sistent with the preceding, inasmuch as a shepherd might in those days, as at the present time, cultivate fruit trees (the sycamore, although the poorest, was the most easily grown), for the purpose of varying the monotony of his milk diet.§ Since the word 1p3 (12) is not the ordinary word for shepherd (the word used in f41@ of 714, spa, being inconsistent with the following }x%, and so easily corrupted from 7p, is generally read p2||), there is some doubt as to the exact idea meant to be conveyed; but, upon the whole, we may understand (v.t. on 11) that Amos was a wool-grower, that is, something more than a mere shepherd. As such, he would naturally make journeys from time to time, and meet men coming and going from all parts of the world as it was known in his day.{
(4) While the language of Amos is rich in figurative speech drawn from many sides of life, nothing is more apparent than the influence exerted on his utterance by the life and occupation which he followed. This is seen, for example, in 2” 3*%” 4?* 5u-17.19 612 44 81 9% But the influence of his rustic life and humble occupation was not limited to the symbols and figures in which we find this thought expressed.

+ So Oort and Gratz, on the ground that sycamores could not be cultivated so far above the sea as Tekoa is located (2700 feet); but it is easy to suppose that Amos, a nomadic shepherd, might have had opportunity at a place lower down, but within the general district of Tekoa, this name being applied to the whole territory down to the pasture-land on the shore of the Dead Sea.

pathy, may account, at least in part, for the absence from his message (v.7.), as from that of Elijah, of anything that savors of tenderness or love. It is in the solitude of shepherd life that one gains most certainly the ability to concentrate attention even on the smallest details. Moreover, here it is that one most easily is “trained in that simple power of appreciating facts and causes which, applied to the great phenomena of the spirit and of history,” constitutes the highest form of intellectual life.
4. The shepherd was taken by Yahweh from following the flocks, as Elisha was taken from following the oxen with the plough. But was there no call, definite and comprehensive, like those of Isaiah (chap. 6), Jeremiah (chap, 1), and Ezekiel (chap. 1) ? And, in any case, where did this shepherd really obtain the intellectual preparation that justified the divine selection and is evidenced in his writings?
(1) We shall see that Amos is not an unlettered rustic, although many attempts, beginning with Jerome, have been made to prove him such. (@) There is nowhere to be found in the Old Tes- tament an example of stronger or purer literary style. He is absolute master of the language which he uses. Where did he gain this mastery? (4) His knowledge of history and society is as marked as his literary style. He has seen things with his own eyes; his perception is as delicate as his human interest is broad. He knows of nations, but also, in each case, of the national character. He is an ethnologist, informing his auditors of the origin of nations, as well as an historian; a geographer, cognizant of the rise of the Nile, of the far distant Cush, and the equally distant Babylonia, as well as a sociologist. V. the Map of Amos and Hosea. (¢c) His conception of God and man and right (v.z.) is something that is thought to be marvellous. He is not credited with the ability to work miracles, as were his predecessors; but is he so detached from his environment, so abnormal in his attainments, so irregular in every way as to consti- tute in himself a real miracle? *
 
* We. (Prol. 472) says, “Amos was the founder of the purest type of a new phase of prophecy.” Co. (Proph. 46) says, “ Amos is one of the most marvellous and in- comprehensible figures in the history of the human mind, the pioneer of a process of evolution from which a new epoch of humanity dates.” WRS. (Proph, 120)

(2) He maintains for himself (7!) that he was not called to his work by the usual technical methods, viz. through the prophetic societies. We do not understand, as many do,* that this statement indicates on the part of Amos an utter contempt for the order of mebhi’im ; because (a) elsewhere he speaks (24 37) of the ~adhi’ with great respect,t and in 7 he is ordered to go asa prophet. (4) While he might feel as did Elijah and Elisha toward the great mass of the xedhi’im, he was, after all, too much like Elijah and Micaiah ben Imlah in natural disposition, training, and theological position to do other than respect them and others like them. (¢) He himself uses the technique of pre-prophetism, which had long years been taking form (p. cviii). (@) He stood by no means alone, preceded as he was by J and E, having Hosea as his contemporary, besides others whose names have not come down to us. Amos here t{ merely emphasizes the fact that prophetism or ecstasy has not been Ais profession, and that, consequently, he is not to be identified with those who for so many generations have shown hostility to the government ; and further, that he should not be understood as uttering words such as he has spokeu for the sake of reward or remuneration. He was, after all, in the line of the prophets, spiritually, if not literally.
(3) Reference has already been made to the superior discipline that gave him “desert-eyes,” which, in a “desert-atmosphere,” furnished the best possible training for an observer of human affairs, a student of cause and effect; likewise, to the unsurpassed opportunities afforded him in the prog- ress of travels, which were undertaken in connection with his occupation. (4) But, back of this, is the fact that in Eastern society superior culture is not uncommon in connection with the poverty of shepherd life. “At the courts of the Caliphs and their Emirs the rude Arabs of the desert were wont to appear without any feeling of awkwardness, and to surprise the courtiers by the finish of their impromptu verses, the fluent eloquence of their oratory, and the range of subjects on which they could speak with knowledge and dis- crimination, Among the Hebrews, as in the Arabian desert, knowledge and oratory were not affairs of professional education, or dependent for their culti- vation on wealth and social status. The sum of book-learning was small; men of all ranks mingled with that Oriental freedom which is so foreign to our habits; shrewd observation, a memory retentive of traditional lore, and the faculty of original reflection took the place of laborious study as the ground of acknowledged intellectual preéminence.” §

(5) But are we quite certain that the more usual method of vision was not employed in the case of Amos? It is worthy of notice that in Amos, as well as in the latest prophets, the vision plays an im- portant part. Is it not probable that the first visions, viz. those of the fire, locusts, and plummet, constituted, not only the beginning of Amos’s work, but also, in large measure, his actual awakening and incitement to the task which he endeavored so faithfully to perform?* We cannot urge against this, that these initiatory visions are not recorded in the first chapter, for in Isaiah’s case the call is found in chap. 6; and, further, we have no reason for expecting the sermons, in their written form, to be put in chrono- logical order (v.7.).
(6) The antecedents of Amos’s thought will be considered when we take up the substance of his message (v.z.); but we must, at this point, again touch upon the external facts connected with Amos’s position in so far as they relate to the problem of his prep- aration; Amos must have had models. What were they? We may cite : (a) the prophets referred to by himself in 2"*, and rep- resented as of high repute; (4) Elijah and Elisha (v.s.); (¢) the Judaean narrative and the Ephraimite narrative, in which, although mainly narratives, are contained many disconnected fragments of prophetic utterance ; (7) the personal acquaintance with prophets or prophetic experience implied in 3"; (e) the priestly literature which (Ho. 8”) had already taken written form, a striking prece- dent for the prophet, cf. the decalogues and Book of the Cove- nant ; (/) the prophetic formulas which, as employed by Amos, show long and technical usage, either written or handed down from mouth to mouth ; f (g) the great poetical pieces which had come down from times that would have seemed ancient even to Amos, ¢.g. Ju. 5 Gn. 49 Dt. 33. This material, which Amos must have known, furnished the background or basis from which a literary style as perfect even as that exhibited by him might have been developed.
5. The character of Amos is quite plainly indicated in the facts already noted: (2) He was bold; but this boldness was that of indifference and reserve, rather than of passion. His courage had
 
* So Meinhold, 39, H. P, Smith, O. 7, Hés¢, 211. t Che. ZB, 155 f,

its origin, not in enthusiasm, but in a certain kind of fatalism. (6) He was accurate in his observations and scientific in his habits of mind. He was able, not only to see the facts, but also to describe them as they actually were. It was this that made it possible for him to write ou¢ his utterances. This element in his character contributed greatly to the new impulse given through him to prophecy. This was the sage element. He recognizes law. His sermons are the proclamation of divine law, not the oracles of a soothsayer. He was more of a realist than an idealist. He does not permit his fancy to picture the future. His utter- ance is a continuous, deadly monotone of ruin and destruction. (c) He was nomadic in his instincts; like Elijah, hostile to the softer influences of civilization; without the ties which bind a man to country, and so without patriotism; without family bonds, so far as we can ascertain, and so without much human sympathy. To be sure, Northern Israel was to him a foreign country ; but we can imagine that his disposition toward Judah would have been the same. (d@) He was austere ; but could such a message as he was sent to deliver be other than austere? Hosea announced the same doom in terms more terrible, but less severe. His conception of God was that of the Puritan ; his temperament, stern and uncompromising. ‘‘Amos’s nature was not a sensitive or emotional one ; it was not one in which the currents of feeling ran deep : it was one which was instinct simply with a severe sense of right.”* He sat as judge, unmoved by the awful character of the doom he was obliged to pronounce. In him justice does not contend with love.t (¢) In what sense was he spiritual? He was not a devout man like Isaiah, nor was he, like Hosea, emo- tional. His spirituality, which was intense, consisted in loyalty to truth and in antagonism to error, in recognizing the character of Yahweh as spiritual, and as wholly inconsistent with that character the round of ritualistic routine which, in his day, constituted worship. The preacher who said, “Seek me and live,” was a preacher, not only of righteousness, but also of the truest spirituality.

cx INTRODUCTION
§ 13. THe MessaGe or Amos.
Amos’s message is in some respects the most important of any conveyed by an Old Testament writer. Great interest centres in and about this message, because (@) it is the first of a series of writings which stand alone in the world-literatures ; (4) it places a stress upon the ethical side of religion greater than had before existed ; (¢) it marks a new epoch in the history of Israel’s relations with the nations of the world — the Assyrian period.
1. The most general analysis of Amos’s message discovers in it only two or three factors: (@) a profound conviction on certain subjects relating to God and human life; (4) a knowledge of certain facts in national and international history ; (¢) a conclu- sion, which follows the putting together of the conviction and the knowledge of the situation.*
The message of Amos must be obtained from words actually uttered or written by Amos himself. This involves the separation of insertions and additions coming from the pen of later prophets. Nearly one-fifth of the book which bears the name of Amos is thus to be set aside. It is to be con- ceded at once that the omission of these passages modifies very considerably the nature and content of the message. It is most important, however, in the interest of a true historical development of Israelitish thought, to restrict ourselves to those portions of the book the authenticity of which is incontro- vertible.. The other portions have just as important a place to occupy in the later literature.
2. The general circumstances under which the message of Amos was delivered have already been considered. It is necessary, however, to formulate more definitely the exact state of feeling and opinion against which the prophet felt compelled to array himself. We may call this the popular opinion ; but it was more than this, for it represented, not only the mass of the people, but also the royal family and the court, the priests, and the vast majority of the prophets themselves.t What, precisely, was the consensus of thought to which the prophet made oppo-

sition?* Or, in another form, What was the popular prophecy (or. theology) from which true prophecy now separates itself as never before ?
(1) The people held fast to the conception that Yahweh was one among other gods, invincible within the boundaries of his own land, and able to extend those boundaries against the power of other gods. He was no longer a deity whose residence lay outside of Canaan (7.e. at Sinai) ; for he had, with Israel, taken possession of the old sanctuaries in Canaan, and was now (especially since the rooting out of Baalism) in very truth the deity of the land. To be sure, he had, in idealistic fashion, been transferred to a resi- dence in the heavens; and this had influenced somewhat the popular mind. Yet what was essentially naturalism controlled © the life and thought of the masses.
(2) This involved the thought of Yahweh as exclusively inter- ested in Israel, as satisfied, therefore, with a devotion which restricted itself to his worship. Service in the forms prescribed would secure the contmued strength and existence of the nation. When “the day of Yahweh,” thought to be not far distant, actually came, there would be relief from all difficulties, victory over all remaining foes. To think of Yahweh without Israel was absurd : for what could he do, how would he conduct himself, without his people? What would become of Yahweh if Israel were to perish? Whether this was on the basis of naturalism,+ or on the ground of a voluntary act in the form of a covenant, { it was none the less nationalism, and was accepted by the great body of prophets who had risen above what may have been the earlier and still more common belief in naturalism. But naturalism was itself a form of nationalism; the latter, consequently, included the former. The people, led by nearly all the leaders, interpreted the present period of peace and prosperity, growing out of the victories gained
 
* One might ask, Was Amos opposing an old order of things, or was he advocat- ing something new? The answer is, He did both. The new idea, or the old idea which he emphasized, was definitely opposed to the existing current opinion. The presentation of it by Amos made it, for practical purposes, a new idea, although he clearly represented it as something not unknown even to the people.

cxii INTRODUCTION
in the Syrian wars, as definite indication of Yahweh’s pleasure and satisfaction. What more could he ask? Did he not himself share in this prosperity? Everything, as they viewed it, was in right condition.
(3) A corollary of nationalism (as well as of naturalism) was the belief that Yahweh was not only pleased to favor Israel, but also actually bound to protect their political interests, without reference to their moral conduct. He might show his anger for a time; but sooner or later, without reference to right or wrong, he must identify himself with those who were thus bound to him by the closest bond, whether that of nature or of cove- nant. To him was accorded no option in the matter. In other words, he could not act toward Israel on the basis of ethical consideration. ‘The henotheism was non-moral, z.e. natural. The Israel of these times “neglected entirely his (Yahweh’s) ethical character.”
(4) A second corollary of nationalism was the feeling enter- tained concerning Yahweh’s relation to other nations. It was his duty, in fact his highest function, to fight the battles of his people against their enemies ; and his strength, compared with that of other deities, was measured by the success or failure of such battles. But, aside from this, Yahweh had nothing to do with out- side nations, who, in each case, had their own gods. He is con- cerned with them on/y when they seek to injure Israel. For such injury he will use his best endeavor, in turn, to inflict injury upon them. He had thus shown his power against Egypt, in Canaan, and recently against Syria; but his relationship to these nations ceased when peace was declared. In any dealings, therefore, with other nations, Yahweh acts directly and exclusively for Israel. Israel is wholly his ; he is wholly Israel’s.
(5) It was, still further, the conviction of the people that Yah- weh’s favor was secured and his anger averted by following out, in its various forms, the ceremonial or cultus which prevailed at this period. The holding of festivals, the presentation of sacrifices, was something, on the one hand, indispensable to religion ; and, on the other, altogether satisfying to the deity. What did he desire? Gifts, pilgrimages, and praises; since other things than these could hardly be expected. Yahweh demands these ; nothing
THE MESSAGE OF AMOS CXlll
more. The increasing costliness of these requirements promoted injustice and inhumanity.*
(6) The corollary of the preceding is contained in the words just used, “nothing more.” The people understood that moral delinquencies (in so far, indeed, as they recognized the existence of any such) were entirely overlooked by Yahweh ; provided, of course, they performed faithfully the routine of sacrifice. That they were not entirely ignorant of moral duties is clear, not only because certain moral distinctions were already known to all the world, but also because a code, largely moral in its character, had re- cently been formulated (p. xiv). But notwithstanding their actual knowledge of right and wrong, at least in certain particulars, they did not believe that morality was a necessary factor in religion. It was, in fact, unnecessary, if the routine of worship was strictly observed. This conception was fundamental in the early Semitic religions, and signified that moral defects were, upon the whole, comparatively unimportant. Perhaps the decalogue was not so clearly a moral code as we now regard it, or, if such, had not yet been taken as authoritative (p. Ix ff.).
(7) Assyria was, of course, in the thought of the people; but they did not fear her. Why should they? Had not Yahweh given sufficient exhibition of his strength to warrant their supreme con- fidence in his ability? Egypt and Syria were equally interested with Israel and Judah in standing out against Assyria’s claims. And Assyria, surely, could not overpower four nations thus closely interested in each other’s protection. Besides, Assyria was often seriously engaged with revolts in other sections of “her huge and disorganized empire.” { In any case, Assyria did not uniformly sweep all before her. There was always a good chance of success- ful opposition. Were the prophets themselves so confident of Assyria’s place and future success as to make unambiguous men- tion of her name in their predictions?
3- The convictions of Amos on the subjects mentioned above, whatever may have been their source, were radically different from those of the people at large. His training in the desert, his travels

Cxiv INTRODUCTION
to other countries, his acquaintance with the ideals of former gener- ations, together with his appreciation of their ideals, his study of Israelitish life, — these, combined with the qualities of mind and heart bestowed upon him by an all-wise Providence, produced, under the direction of that same Providence, certain convictions which he was enabled to express in a form destined to influence most vitally the whole trend of religious thought.
The thought of Amos is of two kinds: (1) Much is simply in direct antag- onism with the prevailing thought. Knowledge of the popular feeling on this or that subject means knowledge also of the position taken by Amos, since the latter is the very opposite of the former. This, however, may not be called negative, for there is always to be seen the larger, fuller teaching which underlies. (2) Much, on the other hand, may be described as strongly positive, ze, as the statement or restatement of everlasting truth. Was this the first statement, or only a restatement? There were also some popular beliefs, afterwards condemned, concerning which he does not speak (v.2.).
(1) The god of Amos was Yahweh of Hosts (528. 698.02 ).G% this included the hosts of heaven as well as of earth, nature, and nations. One of his favorite expressions is “ Lord Yahweh,” f which occurs fifteen times. To Amos, then, Yahweh was ad/- sovereign, omnipotent.
(a) His power over nature is seen in his control of rain, mil- dew, locusts, and pestilence (4°"), as well as in the melting or quaking of the earth, { and in the rising and falling of the Nile (889°) ; and in history it is manifested, not only in bringing Israel out of Egypt (9’), but in bringing the Syrians from Kir, and the Philistines from Caphtor (1°), and in the direction of the destiny which he assumes in the case of Philistia (1°*), Ammon (1””), and Moab (2"*) ; and further, it reaches even to heaven and Sheol, along with Carmel and the bottom of the sea (9? *), — all this, in addition to the management of Israel’s own affairs, both spiritual and material. We may not forget, however, that the nations referred to in these statements are those near at hand (this power is not sadd to be universal) ; that to the gods of other nations their worshippers attributed the same powers ; that both J and E

had localized Yahweh in heaven before Amos spoke ; that criticism has pronounced as late the passages of clearest import (v.z.) ; and finally, that in Amos, so far as we can discover, Yahweh has per- sonal intercourse only with Israel, and that, too, with Israel as a nation.*
(4) This suggests the question whether we have here real monotheism.t If Amos anywhere denied the existence of all other gods, the case would be clear. But where is there such a denial? The intermediate step between the conception enter- tained by Israel and the later conception of monotheism was that of unlimited power. This in itself did not entirely shut out the idea that there were other gods. It is better, therefore, to under- stand that it is “a belief in the unqualified superiority of Yahweh so absolute as to be practically a belief in his omnipotence,” { or in other words, ethical monotheism not strictly, but “ to all intents and purposes.” §
(¢) But what relation would these other gods sustain to Yahweh, now that he possessed this unlimited power? If Yahweh brought the Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians from Kir (as, indeed, he did bring Israel from Egypt), he must have acted in a way contrary to the will of the gods of those countries, for no god would willingly permit his people to be broken away from him. These and other like heathen gods are, therefore, inferior and subject to Yahweh. “They may for a time presumptuously imagine themselves to have independent power, but in reality they only carry out the will and commands of Yahweh” || (cf. Is. 10°"). Yahweh, then, is a God who in earlier times defeated the gods of Egypt, Philistia, Canaan; in more recent times, he has overthrown the Phoenician Baal and the Syrians. It is easy to see how the history of the past and the work of Elijah and Elisha helped Amos to this point of view.

(7°) ; the phrases “turn my hand” (1°), “will not smell ” (5), “ eyes of the Lord Yahweh” (9°*) ; the representation of Yahweh as taking an oath (4? 6°* 8"); and the appearance of Yahweh in the visions (7+*7 8! 9!) ?. These are not evidences of crude re- ligious thought, but, like similar expressions in our own religious language,* arise from the difficulty which is inherent in any effort to represent the personality of deity. There is in this language no survival of the former naive belief that Yahweh had the form of a htman body. “A clear formula for the notion of bare spirituality such as we find in John 4% was beyond the reach of the Old Testament.” f
(e) But did Amos pass by the image-worship, so large a factor in his day, without remonstrance ? We know that no objection was made to the use of images in early times (even Ex, 341’, the older decalogue, objecting only to molten images of metal), { and testimony to their use is found in the ephod, the presence in connection with the ark (Nu. 10%>), and the tera- phim (v.z.). It is in the later decalogue that we have the first prohibition (v.s.). Hosea (8*8 10° 13?) enters protest against image-worship. But does Amos? Not in 2 (their lies = their idols), for this is unquestionably late ; nor in $14, since the text is wholly unsatisfactory (pp. 181, 184).§ Elsewhere there is nothing to indicate his feeling on this point ; but we are by no means certain that he approved them.
(f) It remains to notice Marti’s interesting statement on the relation of Amos’s monotheism to that of other nations. He says: “No one can fail to observe how, in this belief of Amos, monotheism is present in essence, even if not in name, and what an altogether different kind of monotheism it is from that to which the priests in Babylon and Egypt are said to have attained! There in Babylon and Egypt a monotheistic speculation, which possesses no force and is wholly indifferent toward the polytheism of the mass, whose gods this theory allegorizes and dissolves in a general con- ception; here among the prophets in Israel a vigorous and vital faith in Yahweh, who suffers no gods alongside of himself, who watches jealously over
 
* Cf, Duhm’s remark (Theol. 120 f.) to the effect that this does not indicate the nature religion, since nature religions do not azthropo-morphize; they rather physio-morphize, since the physical is the common ground upon which deity and humanity meet and become like each other. Our metaphysical abstractions con- cerning the nature of God and the relations of God and Christ, their personality, etc., are much nearer physiomorphism than Amos’s anthropomorphism.

THE MESSAGE OF AMOS Cxvii
his own exclusive worship, and directs the destinies of men as the only God. A relationship and dependence between the monotheism in Babylon and that in the Bible does not exist ; their radically different origin is the basis of the difference. In Egypt and Babylon monotheism is theory; in Israel, strength and life; there it is the product of a speculating abstraction, won through a fusion of the gods ; here the experience of a higher Being, the inner realiza- tion of his moral and spiritual might, grown from a moral and religious deepening, from an intimate union with a special God who, moreover, does not disappear and dissolve, but remains the living one, and proves himself the only living one. There the empty concept of monotheism ; here, indeed, though the word (viz., monotheism) is not yet coined, the fulness of power and life which must indwell this faith, where it is a true faith. How vividly, however, Yahweh was experienced as power by Amos is shown by 34%, per- haps, notwithstanding its simplicity, the most magnificent portion of his prophecy: not merely is God an hypothesis of the intellect, but the per- ception of him is a result of the announcement of God himself.”
(2) Yahweh is never called “God of Israel” (v.2.) in Amos. He is, rather, the God of the world; and yet he represents him (in common with all that precede) as sustaining a peculiar relation to Israel, and puts in his mouth the phrase, “my people” (7”). This relation is not indissoluble ; it is, on the contrary, plainly conditioned, and will surely be annulled if the conditions are not complied with. (@) Amos does not grapple with the question, why Israel, rather than some other nation, was selected by Yahweh for this special relationship. It is evident that a deity so powerful among the nations as was Yahweh could have taken any other nation, ¢.g. the Philistines, whom he actually did bring from Caph- tor, or the Syrians, who were removed from Kir. But (4) accept- ing this as a fact, he tells his contemporaries (3”) that on this very account (viz. that Yahweh knew Israel out of all the nations of the earth) he would judge them all the more strictly for the sins which they had committed. ‘Obligation is the complement of privilege ; punishment, of sin.” * Moreover (c), his interest is not in the world for Israel’s sake, but rather in Israel for the world’s sake. Israel, after all, is no more to him than are the Cushites (9’). (d) If Israel will only seek him, the future will be safe (4); but the prophet has given up all hope that Israel, devoted as she now is to the sweet religion of the crowd, will ever do what he suggests (v.7.).
(3) The conception of Yahweh which Amos entertains is that
* Bu, Rel. 134.
Cxvili INTRODUCTION
of a god of justice. This thought Elijah (x K. 21” ®) had already expressed, but Amos goes farther and makes the idea the very centre of his conception of God.* He is all the better able to reach this high point, because he has also conceived of Yahweh as standing in close relation to all nations. Yahweh’s power being universal, it is necessarily impartial and consequently ethical. On the other hand, if Yahweh is ethical, he cannot be a national god, that is, show favor to Israel ; he must be a world-god. Righteous- ness being a vital element in Yahweh’s character, he not only will demand it in those who profess to be his followers, but also will enforce the demand. He cannot, however, have one standard for the nations and a lower standard for Israel. If, for any reason, Israel has enjoyed special privileges, the standard by which she shall be judged is to be placed all the higher. Two points, how- ever, require notice, both pointed out by Duhm,f viz. (a) Amos has no adequate conception of sin ; to him the life of man and God should naturally express itself in good. This good is an objective matter, something regarded as present, while all departures from it arouse the anger of Yahweh. Everything is regarded concretely, and at the same time negatively (v.z.). (@) There is no glimmer of a purpose on the part of Yahweh in the working out of this idea of righteousness, and “ the ethical, apart from the teleological, remains unfruitful.”
(4) Yahweh’s relation to the outside nations follows closely upon the idea, already indicated, of Israel’s relation to Yahweh. In fact, it precedes. To have unlimited power is to control the world. This includes Assyria, as well as the nations living in closer proximity to Israel. Egypt had already felt the power of Yahweh’s hand. So had Canaan in days past, and Syria more re- cently. Does Yahweh’s righteousness make demands of all these nations? Is it for lack of proper treatment of his nation Israel
 
* Cf. Gn. 1825; but this lofty utterance can hardly have preceded Amos. We. (Hex. 27 f.) treats 18226-83 as a late addition to JE; Kue. assigns it to J2; Di. argues for its retention in J (so Dr.) ;’Co. declares it to be “ theologically about a century later than J”; Bacon, Holzinger, and Gunkel also consider it a late expansion; while Carpenter and Battersby ( The Hexateuch, I. 26) say that it “seems to belong to the group of probable additions in which the universal grandeur and sole sover- eignty of Yahweh are again and again asserted in the most emphatic terms,” e.g. Ex, 810. 226 gl416. 298, t Theol, 120 ff.
THE MESSAGE OF AMOS Cxix
that he will punish them? or because of their idolatry? No; but in each case is cited, as the direct occasion of the doom, the viola- tion of some dictate of universal morality, some principle of the natural laws of humanity and mercy.* This is no narrow point of view.
(5) It follows, still further, that Yahweh, in the opinion of Amos, cannot be affected even by the strictest observance of the ceremonial. In Yahweh’s eyes, such observance is itself transgression (pw, 4*). Israel’s pilgrimages he hates ; he despises their feasts, their offerings he will not accept; their songs of praise he will not hear (57). But this is not all. He stands ready to destroy the nation’s places of worship (3% 5° 7°), and to pursue to the bitter end those who worship at these places (9'*). What does Amos (pp. 129-136) really mean? Does he, perhaps, say more than he means? We must guard against attributing to him what he never said. This is done by those (p. 136) who wrongly interpret 5” as suggesting that in the days of the wilderness no sacrifices were offered.{ What is it, now, that Amos denounces? ‘To have opposed sacrifice in itself would have meant opposition to the only method yet known to humanity of entering into communion with deity, in a word, the abolition of all tangible worship. If the Old Testament, even when its day was finished, had no true formulation for the conception of God as a spirit, how shall we look for practically this same thing in the days of Amos? It was, therefore, not sac- rifice in general that Amos opposed ; { nor was it the belief that sacrifice when duly performed can change the mind of Yahweh. It was, rather, the belief that had become fixed, “a strange delu- sion deeply rooted in Israel’s heart,” that the ritual of z¢se/f does or can satisfy an ethical deity. Shall one observe the ritual? Yes; but one may not stop there.
(6) Yahweh, then, has something to demand besides worship,
 
* WRS. Proph. 134.
+ A prophet who has nothing to say against the use of images will surely not go so far as to object altogether to sacrifice, Moreover, neither Amos nor any other Israelite, preceding the exile, could have dreamed of a period in Israel’s history when no sacrifices were to be offered. This would actually have involved a purely vegetarian diet.

CxXX INTRODUCTION
which has hitherto been understood to constitute the whole of religion. This grows out of Yahweh’s ethical character, and is, in fact, an ethical demand (2** 3! 4! 57° ™ 6164 8*f), It is a demand for justice, which, in its simplest and most natural form, includes honesty, integrity, purity, and humanity.* (a) This, it will be noted, is concrete, and includes the elementary duties of life, such as are recognized by all nations who have risen to the point of governmental organization.f (6) It is only this which Yahweh demands of other nations. (¢) The demand does not necessarily depend upon a code of legislation ; in other words, it is not legal justice. (d) It demands the utmost consideration of the poor and weak, —mora/ justice. (¢) The prophet promises life and prosperity (5*) to those who meet this demand, while all disas- ter is due to the wrath of Yahweh against those who fall short of this requirement (3°). }
(7) This brings us to the prophet’s position, touching the nation’s future, including his conception of the “Day of Yahweh.” Israel, in very truth, must suffer punishment ; and the punishment, since everything else has been tried, will now be utter demolition. This is really the great thought of the message. Everything else is connected with this sentence. It is important (cf. Duhm), because no one had ever even dreamed of such a thing for the nation, and also because the overthrow contemplated was in no sense the plan of a party, nor had it anything of a political character. It is expressed many times and in many forms, always terrible and always irrevocable.§ It is the unmistakable expression of the condemnation of wicked Israel by the absolutely righteous Yahweh. The sentence of destruction, however, is not wholly unconditional. That Amos pointed out a way of escape, viz. repentance, open perhaps only to a few, is clear from 4*® 5%*; that he should not have contemplated such a possibility of conversion is psychologi- cally unintelligible, since it would leave his entire prophetic activity without a sufficient raison d’étre. But whatever expectation he may have had at the opening of his ministry, it is practically cer- tain that in the progress of his ministry all hope deserted him as he saw the utter lack of response to his message.

THE MESSAGE OF AMOS CXXi
We cannot prove that Amos saw in the future a brighter picture in case of repentance (9*” being surely of a later date) ; nor are we even reasonably certain that, being from Judah, he had it in his mind that Yahweh’s true religion would be continued and devel- oped by Judah after the destruction of Israel. The motto (17) would express this idea, if only it were from Amos’s hand, but cf. pp. 9 f. On Amos’s conception of the Day of Yahweh, z. pp. rarid.
4. Did Amos and those who immediately followed him create Israelitish ethical monotheism ? Or can it be shown that, so far as essential content is concerned, Amos’s teachings are rooted in the past ?
(1) The answer determines, not only the place of prophecy in the progress of the Old Testament development, but also the whole course of that development. If Amos had little or nothing before him in the way of antecedents, he is to be assigned the place ordi- narily given to Moses as the founder of the religion. No one, cer- tainly, in these days is disposed to minimize the high place which he has come to occupy, but we may fairly ask ourselves whether the emphasis has always been placed upon just the right point.
It is now clear that the Old Testament history, like other histo- ries, was anevolution. Every period of great activity grew out of something that preceded. Was the wonderful movement which found expression through Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah entirely excep- tional, in that it came forth without antecedents ? So some would have us believe.* This, at all events, is the real position of those who use the phrase “creators of ethical monotheism.” It has been observed that Amos himself makes no direct appeal to something earlier than his own work. For example, he does not openly refer to a preéxisting code of laws as the basis of his system, any more than to miracles or institutions. But does this prove that his ideas are not rooted in the past, and that his work and that of his times are not merely the fruitage of seed sown long before ? ¢
(2) We cannot deny that the morality which forms the essence

CXXil INTRODUCTION
of his thought is, when closely analyzed, fundamental ; but it is also simple and of long standing. The demands made for justice, including honesty, humanity, etc., go back to the earliest days of history. He surely did not discover or invent them. These are ideas that have appealed to men of all nations for all centuries. Are they not the basis on which rests the prophet’s condemnation of the neighboring nations? Yet nothing more is asked of Israel than of them. But this is not all. Amos represents Israel as knowing these things, failing to do them, and, therefore, as de- serving of punishment. Neither Israel nor the. other nations would have merited destruction for failing to observe conditions or commands of which they were totally ignorant. ‘To neither man nor people can the righteousness which Amos preached appear as a discovery, but always as a recollection and a re- morse.” * ‘Is this representation of Amos, then, an anachronism, or, perhaps, a piece of beautiful rhetoric, or, in plain words, a misrepresentation ? But those who call it an anachronism give it the highest place of value. This does not seem consistent. Moreover, if we recall that Amos resided within sight of Jerusa- lem and, being the kind of man he was, must, therefore, have been in intimate relationship with much of the spirit as well as of the material of the nation’s past experiences, it is fair to suppose on @ priori grounds that Amos drew largely upon the accumula- tions of this already celebrated past. But we need not rest the case on an argument of this character.
(3) Amos actually shows a knowledge of the past history of Israel, and expresses this knowledge in a manner which indicates a supposition of knowledge on the part of the people; cf. his references to the exodus and the conquest (29* 315” 97), to the religious history of his people (2"*), to the series of past chastise- ments inflicted by Yahweh (4°"), and his allusion to David (6°).t Israel’s ethics, in so far as they had yet developed, rested on the choice made of Yahweh, and the character of Yahweh (v.7.) as shown in history. Knowledge of history meant also acquaintance and familiarity, on the part of those who were at all intelligent, with this basis (v.s.).
* GAS, I. 98. + Cf. Dr., pp. 113 f.
THE MESSAGE OF AMOS CXxili
Moreover, the terminology of prophecy employed by Amos is the product of generations of prophetic activity.* Cf. his fre- quent use of the established formulas A177 “ax AD (15% 2h 32? oe 4. 16.17. 27 Hs and st OND (22 aut 4° 6. 8b. 9. 10. 11 6° 14 88 9"), and of the strongly prophetic title mxax m7; his employment of the vision as an impressive method of communicating Yahweh’s mes- sage to Israel; and his recognition of the dirge as a most appro- priate vehicle for his message of doom (5'*).
(4) We may be still more specific and note that in 2°” reference is made to “consecrated personalities,” for whom a keen appre- ciation was manifested. Who were they? Not only Elijah and Elisha, but also J and E; and how many more of whom we now have no record! These make up the great pre-prophetic move- ment which we have already tried briefly to describe (§§ 1-11).
(5) That Amos knew written documents, such as the decalogues and the Book of the Covenant, is certain. But this is not all; for (a) national songs had already come into existence, which prepared the way, technically as well as spiritually, for his work, — among them may reasonably be included Ju. 5,{ Deborah’s song; Ex. 15 { (in its earliest form), the song of the Red Sea; Gn. 49, § the tribal blessing, as well as Dt. 32 (?) || and 339; and besides these (2) there were ancient proverbs and folk-lore. Some of these were already incorporated in J and E, e.g. Gn. 26% 277% 3% 8 ® ;

CXxiv INTRODUCTION
some, likewise, have probably been preserved in the collections. of Proverbs, although it is, of course, impossible at this date to dis- tinguish them ; some, indeed, Amos himself preserves, for not a little of the literary strength of his writings is due to his familiarity, not only with history and sociology, but as well with folk-lore and the speech and thought of the common people.
§ 14. THe Ministry or Amos.
With this summary of the work before us, we may consider the external form of Amos’s work, his ministry. If his teaching forms an important part in the history of prophecy, his ministry should be expected to contribute largely to the history of prophetism. If Amos himself is responsible for the book which bears his name (either in the present form or in an earlier form of which the present is an edition enlarged and modified by a later prophet), the literary work is a part of his ministry. This, however, deserves separate and special consideration (p. cxxx ff.). The historical background of the work, as well as the prophet’s personal life and the preparation for his ministry, have been considered in § 12.
1. It is unfair to Amos either to regard the story of the man of Judah (1 K. 13) as a distorted account of his ministry,* or to accept the suggestion that the story of his ministry, like the story of Jonah (in the book of Jonah), is a later invention or fiction.t When we recall (2) that no miracle or wonder-story is connected with his work, either directly or indirectly ; (4) that no ecstatic frenzy is in any way suggested ; and (c) that, on the other hand, all connection with that kind of thing is strongly denied (74), we may at once concede that one has entered upon his ministry who is a prophet in a new sense, at least in so far as the external work is concerned. He receives visions, to be sure; but these are no ecstatic trances, for which music was needed, as in Elisha’s case. They are rather like the visions of Isaiah and Jeremiah, manifestations of a lofty and sublime

character, made not in dream, nor in trance, but through spiritual enlightenment; dealing not with this battle or that promotion to the throne, but with the fundamental truth of God. However, we are surely able to see in these visions, not only the lineal successors of the trance, but also an indication, if we note their number and character, of the practical adoption by the new order of the machinery of the old. If, however, Amos follows closely the old style in receiving his message by vision (although of a more elevated character),* he exhibits a more striking dif- ference in the method of presentation. It is true that in many cases we still have what seem to be only brief oracles or texts, that is, fragmentary utterances. Even these differ from those of older prophets, “ which offered a hard and fast decision of the moment for the moment” ;{ since in many cases they have now taken on the form of sermons, and in all cases they present teach- ing concerning Yahweh’s nature and his purposes for Israel. On the public preaching of the prophet, as distinguished from the writing of his sermons, v.42.
2. A most significant factor in the ministry of Amos is the writing down of his sermons. In this service he is, perhaps, the leader. { The adoption of the new method, viz. that of writing, was the outcome of certain factors in the situation, and itself the occasion of certain others.
(1) It is to be remembered that in this century Israel was, for the first time, enjoying the privileges of civilization. Many forces are set in motion in a nation when it rises into this stage of life, among others that of literature. § There was not only an incentive to writing, but the opportunity for it, as provided in the long peace of Jeroboam’s reign. || Torah-literature had already taken form (Ho. 8) in the laws that had been codified. Prophetic literature also-had come into existence in the form of the great epics of old
* We cannot suppose that these visions were used only as a method of presenting the prophetic thought to the people. Here, asin Isaiah and Jeremiah, we have survivals of the old trance, as the state in which the prophet received the message. Cf. K. DB. V. 676. t Bu, Red. 133.

CxXxvt INTRODUCTION
israel, which J and E had taken pains to put together. Amos, after all, is not showing much originality in taking up the pen, for he is only following those who have already shown him the way.
(2) Then, too, certain changes had come about which led inevitably to this step. Israel’s religion had passed upward to an entirely new position. It was no longer a matter of worship, z.e. ritual. It stood for certain new ideas, which could not be expressed in an institution, but must find for themselves a written record.* The prophetic utterance was no longer a temporary matter, uttered for a special time or set of circumstances; it had become something of eternal value, having to do with truth con- cerning vital subjects. Moreover, the prophet himself has taken on new functions and new responsibilities. He sees more clearly his position as it bears upon human affairs in general, and not merely the affairs of a single nation, nor of a certain time.
(3) The earlier prophets were men who sought to exert “an instantaneous influence.” It was their business to act, as did Elijah, rather than to speak. And, then, it was a matter of supreme moment that now the prophet is expected to give a message with which the people will be displeased. He will no longer be the leader of the masses. His work will be outwardly a failure. His very ill success in reaching the hearts of the people actually forces him to put his words in writing.
(4) In order that there may be secured permanent influence, the prophets’ words must be read and studied. This, and this only, will bring a continuous development of Israel’s religion, and a deepening of it in the hearts of the people. But to obtain this the prophet need not write out his words just as he had spoken them. He may give only the text of his address, or, possibly, a | synopsis of it. The written form may omit much that had only local application. Nor did the writer himself always put his pro- phetic speeches into written form. This may have been left to a band of disciples such as history tells us Isaiah had (Is. 8"), men who desired to see the words of the master justified as only time could justify them (cf. Dt. 18°” Je. 28°).
Amos was first among the prophets to appreciate all this.

Although he probably expected the end of Israel to come within his own generation, he saw the advantage of giving his thought a definite place. He may also have had in mind the possibility of transmitting it thus through disciples.
3. In his political activity, likewise, Amos exhibits variation from the older type of prophet. (1) The difference, however, is one, not in fact, but in method. He is as greatly interested in the national life as was Elijah or Elisha, but he makes no use of political influence. He himself is not an official of the govern- ment (as were Samuel and Elisha), just as he was not an official prophet. He sustained no special relation to the king, as did Nathan or Micaiah. He was only a private citizen. His interest in affairs was intense, but he established no organization to exe- cute his mission. He does only one thing, preach.
(2) His political views (v.s.) concerning the nations near at hand he announces with consummate skill (p. 12), the method chosen being one which brings him into sympathetic touch with the Israelites themselves.*
(3) But his political sagacity is displayed most keenly in his interpretation of Assyria’s relation to the world of that day, includ- ing Israel, and the use made of this interpretation. His mind was not at first clear in reference to the fall of Samaria, but cer- tainly grows more definite with the progress of the visions.
4. The chronological order of the various stages in the minis- try of Amos is uncertain, and its determination will rest upon our final decision as to the structure of the book itself (p. cxxx ff.). The folluwing is suggested as a possible hypothesis : —
(1) In connection with his early shepherd life in Tekoa, he visits many points of interest at home and abroad; and in the course of these visits learns, as an outsider might learn, the methods and work of the nedhi’im (3').¢ This was only a part of that information concerning the world at large which he obtained in these earlier years.
 
 
* Such is the interpretation placed by many scholars upon the arrangement of the first two chapters, e.g. We. on Am, 2!4ff-; Mit., Dr., Now., Marti.
+ Che. (ZB, 157) says,“ Which (¢.e. 3’) Amos could hardly have written, unless he had had the most vivid and ocular evidence of the cffects of a true prophetic impulse even before his own turn came to receive one.”
CXXViil INTRODUCTION
(2) A time came when in visions given him, like those which he had seen others have (v.s.), a definite call to preach was received.* This call grew out of the message contained in the vision of the plumb-line, viz., the irrevocable destruction of Israel. In the two visions which precede, although he saw the doom threatened, he believed it might be averted; but gradually he becomes convinced that Assyria is the source of the danger (6 7), and that ruin is inevitable unless something extraordinary shall avert the catastrophe. He goes to Northern Israel, amazed that every one does not, like himself, foresee the coming disaster.f
(3) Having reached his destination, the work is opened by the proclamation, with diplomatic skill, of one oracle after another concerning Israel’s neighbors. { These may have been uttered on successive days, but, in all probability, were spread over weeks and months. When the proper time has arrived, to Israel (2°) itself is announced the dreadful future with the reasons therefor. In the course of his wanderings he arrives at Bethel. The climax is reached in the sermon of chap. 6, in which captivity is threatened.
(4) This is probably followed by a popular interruption of his work. In any case, demand is made for his authority to utter such pessimistic denunciations, and to announce what really amounts to treason.§ In justification of his words, he tells the story of his call, as it came in the visions of locusts, fire, and plumb-line. This closes with a specific threat against Jeroboam the king. ||
 
 
* These (ecstatic) visions (1) connect Amos closely with the work of the nebhi'im ; (2) are not satisfactorily explained as being merely the vehicle of the prophet’s publication of his message (cf. p. cxxv, and K. DB. V. 6762); (3) are presented after the oracles and sermons (1-6), as the justification of the prophet’s mission (cf, Is.6), and form the continuation of his work after Amaziah’s inter- ruption. + This (p. 74) is the proper interpretation of 37.
{ The resemblance of these utterances to the short oracles of the zebhd'tm can- not be overlooked. Their pleasing character would surely commend the prophet to his auditors. One cannot imagine Cheyne’s reasons (Z8&. 154) for suggesting that these oracles could not have been spoken.
§ This seems to be a reasonable inference in view of the necessity of explaining the present position of the visions, for only in some such way as this can one account for hope contained in the first and second, when the most absolute statement of destruction has just been uttered in 614,
|| The third vision indicates the position which Amos had held since coming to Northern Israel.
THE MINISTRY OF AMOS CXxix
(5) Then fellows the official attack by Amaziah, and the prophet’s explanation of his work, with a scathing rebuke of the priest for his interference.* Whatever the plans for the future may be, he continues for a while the work which he had come North to perform.t
(6) Another vision (the fourth) is received revealing Jsvae/ as ripe for destruction, with an arraignment of the accused, a threat of earthquake and slaughter, followed by universal mourning, Yahweh’s abandonment of his people, despair and destruction. A little later comes the fifth and last vision, che downfall of the sanctuary, with a picture of ruin which none may escape, and an assurance that the destruction will be complete.
(7) The prophet goes back to Judah, perhaps to Jerusalem, { where he puts his addresses into literary form and intrusts them to the disciples of Yahweh, for the use of those who are to follow him (v.2., on his literary work, p. cxxx ff.).
5. The turning-point in Amos’s ministry, and, indeed, the only significant event that has been handed down to us, is the scene at Bethel. We cannot fail to appreciate : (1) The element of tragedy which it includes, for the throne of a king is at stake, the life of the priest is forfeited, and the fate of the nation is sealed. (2) The naturalness of it all, for is not Amos seeking to do just what his ' predecessors back to Samuel had done before him, viz. to unseat the king? How could his words be otherwise interpreted? How could king or priest fail to take cognizance of them? (3) The strange character of Amos’s reply to this point. Is the prophet’s language, in which he foretells Amaziah’s doom, general or special ? We answer, the former. The catastrophe which is soon to befall the whole nation will include the priest with the rest.
a ne
* This arrangement is, on the whole, better than (1) that which introduces the attack before the visions immediately after 614 (so Baumann); or (2) that which places the attack after a// the visions have been announced, and understands that Amos said nothing after his rebuke of Amaziah (so Léhr, Marti).
t It is hardly possible to regard this interference as in any sense a friendly one (Or.). Nor can we easily suppose that Amos was strong enough to disobey what was evidently the king’s command, and not go away atall, At the same time one can scarcely imagine so bold a prophet not doing what this hypothesis takes for granted, viz. continuing to preach until he had finished his message,
t Was this a second visit (cf. 61), as Che. (EZ. 1 54) suggests ?
CXXX INTRODUCTION
6. In forming an estimate of the efficiency of Amos’s ministry, we must note one or two facts : —
(1) There was in Amos a noticeable lack of the religious ele- ment, in the ordinary sense of that word ; and certainly the ministry was not one that could reach very many minds. There were prob- ably not fifty people in Northern Israel who could understand him. It is quite certain that he did not himself have in mind a clear conception of the issue involved in his preaching. He was indif- ferent to everything that had to do with purpose or motive. As Duhm has said, the teleological element was lacking. The fact is, the new element in Amos was that which is represented by the sage. The union of a zadhi’ and a sage in one person produced a prophet in the new sense, the sense in which Amos is entitled to that title.
(2) Amos’s ministry, then, signifies a breaking away from the old; or, better, an infusion into the old of a new spirit, that of ob- servation, philosophical inquiry, acceptance of law. His work fur- nishes for future prophecy a new basis for development, one which will include thought, adjustment to environment, and growth of thought. Still further, although he was a moralist of an extreme type, requiring for the proper balancing of his ideas those of his contemporary Hosea, which were in striking contrast with his own, he nevertheless bequeathed to all mankind certain truths which time has shown to be unchangeable : —
“The truths that justice between man and man is one of the divine foun- dations of society; that privilege implies responsibility, and that failure to recognize responsibility will surely bring punishment ; that nations, and, by analogy, individuals, are bound to live up to that measure of light and knowl- edge which has been granted to them; that the most elaborate worship is but an insult to God when offered by those who have no mind to conform their wills and conduct to his requirements, — these are elementary but eternal truths.” *
§ 15. THe Lirerary Form or Amos’s WRITINGS.
The present form of the book of Amos suggests several prob- lems. How much of the book did Amos himself leave ? What
 
 
* Kirk. Doct. 106,
THE LITERARY FORM OF AMOS'S WRITINGS  cxxxi
portions are of later origin, and what motive suggested their inser- tion?* Through what stages has the book gone? What contact has it had with other literature? And still further, what is the form of composition employed, and what special features of that form deserve attention ?
1. The table on p. cxxxii presents the contents of the book, showing (1) the larger divisions, viz. oracles, sermons, etc., (2) the smaller sections, and (3) the original and secondary elements within each section.
2. The secondary material indicated in the table on p. cxxxii includes the passages (with the exception of a few words or phrases, v.7.) which have been treated as interpolations in the commentary. An examination of these passages shows that they fall into five groups : —
(1) The Judaistic insertion, made after the promulgation of Deuteronomy, and referring to the approaching destruction of Jerusalem, viz. the judgment on Judah, 2**.+
(2) Historical insertions, from a post-exilic date, (2) adding judgments upon Tyre (1°*) and Edom (1™*), thus bringing the whole number (with Judah) to seven; + (4) adding reference to the fall of Calneh, Hamath, and Gath, 6? (cf. Is. 10°”),
(3) Theological insertions, from a post-exilic time, similar in tone and spirit to certain passages in Job § and Deutero-Isaiah. ||
 
* Men in later days of prophecy seem to have regarded it as a pious duty to illustrate older utterances by making application to their own times. If the older form of utterance appeared too harsh for the later age, it was modified; if too obscure, it was explained. The intention was not to preserve and transmit what the prophet had actually said, but rather to indicate what, in the opinion of the later editor, he would have had to say in order ‘“‘to fulfil the religious purpose which he once meant to serve” (cf. K, D&. V. 671; Carpenter and Battersby, flex. 1. 110).
+ There is no basis for adding to this, with Marti, either 31%, for surely Amos, himself a Judahite, could speak of the “whole family”; or 614, for was not Amos concerned also for Zion? Even with these passages treated as insertions, there is no ground for supposing a special edition of Amos to have been issued for the Judahites.
{ No good reason (v. im doc.) exists for regarding, with Marti, 2!9 as such an historical addition (to 29, the difficulty involved in its position is entirely relieved by transposition), or 212 (to 211), or 56 (p. 130).

Here belong (2) the heading of the book, 1° (pp. 9 f.); (4) the well-known doxologies, 4% * 5°? o°f.+
(4) Technical or archaeological insertions, which take the form of expansion, thus adding details to the more simple statement of the original. Here belong, (2) “each woman straight before her,” in 4°; (4) “while yet there remained three months to the harvest,” in 4’* (p. 97), also, “together with the captivity of your horses,” in 4 (p. 100); (¢) “ one field being rained upon,” etc.,. . . “two or three cities staggering,” etc., in 47"°* (pp.97f.) ; (2) “and unto wailing those skilled in lamentation,” in 5% (p. 127); “and the peace-offerings of your fatlings I will not regard,” in 5” (p- 135); (e) the detail of the inner part of the house, in 6°"* (p. 151); (/) “and lo! there were full-grown locusts after the king’s mowings,” in 7'*; (g) the extra technique, in- volving the question of Yahweh to Amos, in 7°* 8%; (h) “ buy- ing the poor for silver,” etc., in 8°; (7) “ your images, the star of,” in 5%, “and it devour,” in 5°, “and the oppressions within her,” in 3°, “O children of Israel,” in 31, “with a storm in the day of tempest,” in 2", “plumb-,” in 7’, “ for thirst,” in 8%,
(5) The Messianic additions found in “Behold the days are coming,” in 8"%, and the long closing passage 9° connected with what precedes by 9°°, in which the interpolator announces that the original message of destruction was intended only for Northern Israel.
(6) Certain phrases, “ The Lord,” “God of Hosts,” “It is the oracle of Yahweh,” “ Has Yahweh said,” which have been inserted arbitrarily to emphasize some favorite thought of a reader, e.g. Sa oP A iB OF algo, “in that, day,’ 8?
3. The internal history of the book (z.e. the various steps in the process of its growth) was probably as follows :—
(1) Amos himself left, not a book, but certain addresses or groups of addresses in writing.
(2) These became a book, in all probability through the work of his disciples, before the times of Isaiah (v.7.), who, says Cheyne, ‘steeped himself in the originality of Amos before displaying his

own truly original genius.” * Since Amos probably issued his addresses in Judah, it is questionable whether Hosea ever saw them (v.2.).T
(3) A Deuteronomic insertion consisting of 24f was probably made in Jeremiah’s time. This address would fit in just before the fall of Jerusalem, almost as appropriately as before the fall of Samaria. It is perhaps too much to call this a Deuteronomic redaction.
(4) During the exilic experience (or a little after) important changes were introduced, viz. (a) those of an historical character (v.s.) in accord with the same spirit which gave rise to Obadiah” (cf. Is. 34 Ez. 25% 35° Ps. 137’) Jo.37*™; and (4) those of a theo- logical character (v.s.) in accord with the same spirit which found expression in the descriptions of the deity that occur in Job and Deutero-Isaiah (v.s.).
(5) In a later post-exilic period there was added the large number of technical and archaeological explanations and expan- sions indicated above. At this time the superscription (1°) probably had its origin. Many of these are glosses which found their way into the text without motive of any kind. Some, how- ever, are the work of an editor who delighted to repeat in minute detail some point or description which had been passed over quite summarily. No definite line perhaps can be drawn between these two classes of additions.
(6) Finally, in the spirit of the days of Zechariah and Zerubbabel, when men were thinking of the restoration of the throne of David, or perhaps still later, there was added the Messianic promise of 9° (v.s.). This closed the internal history of the book.
4. The general structure of the book as understood by the present writer is indicated in the table (v.s.). Its character is extremely simple: A series of judgment oracles ; a series of judg- ment sermons; a series of judgment visions. These various series have each its own unity of thought and its own unity of purpose. These have already been fully discussed.
It remains, however, to notice some of the more important hypotheses put forward in recent times which offer different explanations of Amos’s structure,

(1) Elhorst (1900) on the supposition that the text was originally written in parallel columns, the strophes being arranged so that 1, 3, 5, etc., fell in Column I. and 2, 4, 6, etc., in Column II. and that some copyist transferred
the columns consecutively instead of alternating between the two, proposes the following order; 1-2 12.8.5.181.6-8 21-3 79.10 245.6 560.7 27.8 589 2912

(2) Léhr (1901) finds five main divisions; the first one consists of the introductory address, threatening Israel and her neighbors with punishment, and includes 118-1315 21-3.614.16. The second one contains two addresses, announcing destruction because of the exploitation of the poor by the rich and powerful; the first address consists of 31% ?44-54.6.8-15 4l3 3ti4 glt-4a, the second address comprises 51-4: 7- 10-12. 16-18%. 20-27 61.3-8.11-14, The third division contains the mere fragment of a sermon against the sanctuaries and the ritual, viz. 4#12. 3140. gla.7, The fourth division includes the four visions in 7*? $13; and the fifth division consists of the historical episode in 7!”
(3) Riedel (1902), regarding the book as an anthology of the most signifi- cant utterances of Amos, collected and arranged by a later editor, and treating 710-17 as a later addition, makes the following analysis: I. A poem announcing Yahweh’s judgment on the nations in general, and Israel in particular, chaps. 1and 2. II. The central division (3)-83), falling into three sections: (@) three addresses beginning with “ Hear this word,” 3% 4! 51-17; (4) two addresses beginning with “Alas,” 51827 61-4; (c) the four visions, 7/9 8%, III. The closing address (84-9), likewise consisting of three sections: (a) 8*14, which again begins with “ Hear”; (4) 9! 1, again narrating a vision; (c) 91+”, a word of promise, in part looking back to the first address (cf. 9! with 111®),
(4) Baumann* (1903) finds five addresses, all of similar structure. Each of the last four addresses has three main divisions, the last division in each case summing up the entire speech, and the second division, with one excep- tion, consisting of four sections. First address: 178-1515 21-3. 61a, 12.110. 13. 14a. 16 a. 14. 15a 150.164 (with an appendix, 3%!5). Second address: I, 3162.68;

(2) 733, (4) 7*4, (c) 77°, (2) 8*3; LIL. 9!% 34% 91°47, Baumann sum- marizes the thought in the form of a dialogue as follows: First division (Amos) : Yahweh will bring destruction upon Israel’s foes and also upon Israel; for every crime demands punishment. (Israel) : How unheard of, to maintain that Yahweh would destroy his own people! Who would listen to such folly? Second division (Amos): What I speak is not folly, but the decree of God, Hear, therefore, especially you leaders in iniquity, of impending disaster.

(Israel) Our cultus at the sanctuaries will turn aside every sort of disaster. Third division (Amos): Vain labor of love! Have not past calamities taught you that Yahweh demands a better service? Seek him through the practice of morality and justice! But no, all warning is useless. Because you will not listen, you cannot be helped. Fourth division (Amos): It remains only to raise the funeral dirge and to wail over the blind. Destruction is inevitable. Fifth division (Amos’s justification of his message in response to the protests of Amaziah and the people): God, whom I have seen, has revealed to me what must come, and in spite of my earnest entreaties, has held fast to his decision.
(5) Marti (1903) finds in the original book (a) an announcement of judgment upon Damascus, Ammon, Moab, and Israel herself: 13-5: 18-15

5. The external history of the book of Amos may be traced briefly through four periods : —
(1) Direct evidence of an external acquaintance with it by other prophets is perhaps slight. The similarity of expression found in certain passages in Hosea,* as compared with Amos, proves nothing ; the two were dealing with the same historical traditions and were working in the same environment. The same thing may be said of the two or three passages in which Isaiah and Amos use similar expressions.| In Jeremiah, on the other hand, because the situation is a similar (although not the same) one, more definite trace is found of Amos’s influence.t In Ezekiel, likewise, some points of external resemblance may be noted, espe-
 
* E.g. between Am. 2° etc. (sending fire upon the palace) and Ho. 814 (which is late), Am. 210 (the rescue from Egypt) and Ho. 1210f, Am. 717 (threat of captivity in an unclean land) and Ho, 98, Am, 8° (corruption of Ephraim, unjust scales) and Ho, 128, Am. 88 95 and Ho. 43, Am. 46 and Ho. 719,
t Cf. Is. 301° with Am, 212; Is. 3291.17 (q)xw) with Am. 61; 316f. with Am, 4) ff.; and 97-104 + 525-89 with Am, 4#13,
t This is seen, perhaps, in the formulas employed at the beginning ( 7px 75) and at the end of the utterances against foreign nations; cf. 472 481 4g}. 7. 28. 84 and Am. 18:6 etc,; also 4825. 44 492. 6. 26. 89 with Am, 15. 8.15 28. and in the similarities to be noticed in a comparison of Je. 1727 with Am. 25, 2110 with 94, 2580 with 12, 4927 with 14, 49% with 116, 468 with 214, 467 with 88, 4824 with 112 22, 4918. 20-22 with 112, 48" 498 with 115, The phrase “ virgin Israel” is found only in Am, and Je.; “ days are coming” occurs in no other prophetic books,
THE LITERARY FORM OF AMOS’S WRITINGS cxxxvii
cially in the passages directed against foreign nations.* In the other prophets, few cases of direct external influence may be discovered.f
But it is not in such external manifestations that we should expect to find traces of Amos’s influence upon later prophets. That his ministry and message were known to them appears from several points in which they follow closely in his steps, e.g. in standing aloof from the great body of so-called prophets in their respective periods ; in adopting the method of writing down their utterances; in the continued development of the sermonic dis- course introduced by him; in following the fashion of directing a certain portion of their attention to the foreign nations ;{ in bas- ing their work on the fundamental doctrine of national yudgment as presented by Amos; in holding up and completing the new ideas propounded by Amos concerning God and his ethical demands upon humanity.
(2) The external relation of the book of Amos to the wisdom literature is not indicated by anything that has come down to us. That its influence was felt can scarcely be doubted, since in it we have the first definite formulation of Yahweh’s relation to the out- side world, the idea which lay at the basis of all Hebrew wisdom ; the assignment of Israel to a place upon a level with other nations (cf. the absence of any reference to Israel in the book of Prov- erbs) ; an example of Oriental learning in history, geography, so- cial customs ; the very essence of wisdom, in the emphasis placed upon honesty, purity, etc. ; together with an almost total absence of the religious sentiment (v.s.).
(3) In later times reference is made to the Amos-book in Ecclus. 49”, where “the twelve prophets” are mentioned, showing that at

(4) The place of the book in the Canon is naturally with “ the twelve.” Its position in the Hebrew Canon, viz., third (following Joel), is different from that in G, where it is second (Joel being placed after Micah).
6. Partly on @ priori grounds (it being thought impossible to conceive of a herdsman as a manof letters),* and partly on the ground of certain words which were wrongly spelled (these have more recently been discovered to be textual errors), many ex- planations of the uncultivated and, indeed, rude speech of Amos have been deemed necessary. The fact has long been recognized, however, that these estimates were wrong. Recent writers, espe- cially since W. Robertson Smith in 1882, have vied with each other in appreciation of the simplicity and refinement, as well as of the vigor of Amos’s literary style.{ The latest critics go even so far as to deny that the figures which he employs are prevailingly those of the shepherd-life. §
(1) The regular and simple structure of the book (p. cxxxii) exhibits at once Amos’s style of thought. What could be more natural and easy than the series of oracles, the series of sermons, and the series of visions? It is unfortunate that some recent critics seem as blind to the simplicity of Amos’s style of expres- sion as were the older critics to its refined nature.
(2) This regularity, or orderliness, exhibits itself in detail in the repetition of the same formulas for three transgressions, yea for Jour, etc., in the opening chapters (or, to put it otherwise, in the orderly arrangement of the nations); in the use of the refrain, but ye did not return, etc., in the poem describing Israel’s past chastisements (4**||) ; in the entire form of the first three visions

(7**) ; in the almost artificial symmetry of form seen in the accu- sation (7°) and the reply (7*”); in the series of illustrations employed with such effect in 3°*; in the structure, in general, of the several pieces (v.z.). Moreover, these various series, “ while not so long as to become tiresome, are long enough to impress upon the mind of the reader the truths that they are intended to illustrate and justify the use of them by the prophet.” There is here the skill, not only of the poet and the speaker, but also of the teacher. Every poem in the book is a notable example of this same direct, straightforward orderliness of thought.
(3) The imagery of Amos, like that of Isaiah, is worthy of special study. Tradition has probably been wrong in emphasizing too strongly the prevailingly shepherd-characteristics (v.s.) which mark the figures employed by Amos. But no one will deny that he is especially fond of drawing his language from mature ; and what, after all, is this but the field of rural life? He not only cites certain facts of agricultural significance, e.g. the recent drought, blasting and mildew (4"*), the oppressive taxation of crops (5"), and the cheating of the grain merchants (8°), but he finds pic- turesque illustrations and comparisons in “ threshing instruments ” (1°), the loaded wagon on the threshing-floor (2"), the height of the cedars and the strength of the oaks (2°), the roar of the lion in the forest (3* *), the shepherd rescuing remnants from the lion (3¥), the snaring of birds (3°), the “kine of Bashan” (4*), worm- wood (57 6”), the lion, bear, and serpent (5”), the perennial stream (5%), horses stumbling upon rocks and ploughing the sea with oxen (6”), swarms of locusts devouring the aftermath (Gis and the “ basket of summer fruit” (8°).
(4) Other features of Amos’s style, which may only be men- tioned, are (@) its originality (sometimes called unconventionality or individuality),* as seen in a certain kind of independence, probably due to the fact that he was a pioneer in the application of writing to prophetic discourse ; (4) its maturity, for nothing is more clear than that he had predecessors in this work who had developed, in no small degree, a technical nomenclature of prophecy (v.s.); (¢) its artistic character, which is seen not only beg tl Eee LD PA 2 OR eM eo ie ee

in strophes with refrains, but in the entire strophic structure of the various pieces, together with the measure and parallelism, v.72. It is probable that Amos’s style, as well as the substance of his message, is to be explained largely by the circumstances of his environment (v.5.).
D. HOSEA. § 16. THe PersonaL Lire or Hosea.
The facts of Hosea’s life, while altogether different from those relating to Amos, are equally interesting and instructive.
1. There is no evidence to prove that the man Hosea was of the tribe of Reuben (a view based on the resemblance of his father’s name, Beeri, to Beerah, 1 Ch. 5°) ;* or of the tribe of Issachar (p. 202) ; or of the tribe of Judah, for the passages in which Judah is mentioned are for the most part doubtful, since they seem to be part of a plan (p. clix), and even if authentic would prove neither the prophet’s Judaean birth,t nor the sugges- tion that the book was written out in Judah, when the prophet (like Amos) had been sent away.{ On the name Hosea, v. p. 205 ; on the bearing of the superscription 1, v. pp. 203 f. It is hardly to be questioned that he was a citizen of the Northern kingdom ; v. p. 202, to which may be added, § as matter of detail, that (@) the interest in Northern Israel is seen in his intimate acquaintance with the historical conditions and foreign interests of the North, as well as with the policies of intrigue of the two political parties ; (4) the particular places with which familiarity is shown, all of which lie in North Israel, are Mizpah in the east and Tabor in the west (5’), Samaria (frequently mentioned, 7} 8°* 10°? 131°), Gilead (68 12), Shechem (6°), Gilgal and Bethel (4¥ 9” 10°" 12"), Gibeah and Ramah (5° 10°) ; (c) the differ- ence between Amos’s point of view and that of Hosea illustrates

§ Certain Aramaicisms, e.g. 5y17n (113), An) (518), oNp (104), and the frequent use of the long form 33x, are commonly cited in support of Hosea’s northern origin; but too great stress may not be laid upon these; cf. Kautzsch’s Aramais- men in A. T., which recognizes no Aramaic words in Hosea,

well the difference between a visitor and a resident ; (@) the great historical significance of the book of Hosea is largely affected by the question of his citizenship in the Northern kingdom.
2. The date and circumstances of Hosea’s life and work are, upon the whole, quite definitely settled. While the superscription 1' (pp. 203 f.) is from a later date, it is in part consistent with the facts. Hosea sustains to the fall of the Northern kingdom the same relation which Jeremiah sustained a century and a half later to that of the Southern kingdom.
(1) Can we, however, determine how early he began his work ? or how late he continued to prophesy ?
The following indications of date may be considered: (a) That he was preaching in 743 B.C. is certain in view of the threat concerning Jezreel (14), which must have been uttered before the fall of Jehu’s house, that is, before the death of Jeroboam II.; for Zechariah’s reign was very short, and imme- diately thereupon came the period of anarchy. If 1* was uttered in 743, the prophet’s marriage and the birth of his oldest son must be understood to have preceded. (On the date of the writing of chaps. 1-3, v. § 19.) (4) That he lived in the midst of the period of anarchy which followed the death of Jeroboam II. (z.¢e. 743-736 B.C.) seems to be shown by the utterance found in 77 (perhaps also 7°. 84), which reflects the condition of things in this period.* (c) The lack of allusion of any kind to the Syro-Ephraimitish war of Pekah and Rezin against Judah (Is. 7, 2 K. 1597-38) would indicate that Hosea was not in active service at that time (734-733 B.C.), for one cannot imagine silence on his part with reference to events of such importance. t (2) Still further, Gilead in Hosea’s day was still a part of Northern Israel (51 68 1211); but in 734-733 B.C. Gilead and Naphtali passed under the yoke of Tiglathpileser. ¢
The certain dates, then, are 743 B.c. and 734 B.c. How much earlier than 743 Hosea may have preached cannot be determined. (2) The historical events of the period just indicated (cf. 2 K.15) fit in admirably with the descriptions of Hosea’s times found in his addresses. (a) In the earlier part, the times are

represented as prosperous, just as in the days of Amos; evidences of wealth and ease are seen on every hand, and punishment is still in the future (2° 9*) ; (4) a little later the situation is greatly changed ; lawlessness is prevalent (47 5' 7’), the panic-stricken rulers are vacillating between Assyria and Egypt (5% 7" 12°), political dissolution has already begun (7° 8°), the powerlessness of the kings is generally recognized (10° 13°), the religious and political leaders are the worst violators of the laws (4°* 5* 9”), conspiracies and revolution are rife (5% 7" 10° 12’), and anarchy prevails.
(c) While the situations described by Amos and Hosea have much in common, there is also much that is different. Hosea actually sees the chaos and confusion, the decay, of which he preaches. Nor are the evils of the times, as seen by him, limited to those of the ruling classes (cf. 41% §** 9’), as for the most part in Amos. Moreover, Hosea seems to be himself a part of the situation, in a sense in which Amos, not being a resident of Israel, could not have been. He did not see so widely, but he saw more deeply.
3. Concerning Hosea’s occupation and social standing, we are able only to draw inferences of a more or less uncertain character. (a) Was he a member of the prophetic society? Nothing is to be found which would point in this direction.* (4) Was he a priest, and for this reason was he enabled to speak against the evil practices of his class as no one else could have done? ft ‘This is an interesting conjecture, with perhaps as little evidence in its favor as against it. His intimacy with life of every kind, in nature and among men, those of the country as well as those of the city, does not oppose this view. (¢) His acquaintance with life in general, and especially with that of the priests, taken in connec- tion with his familiarity with the plans of both political parties, and his intimate knowledge of his country’s history (pp. cliii, cliv), may reasonably warrant us in the opinion that he occupied a “ distinguished position” as a citizen in his native land.
4. Hosea’s call and preparation constitute a tragedy in domestic

life, and give us even a deeper insight into his career and pro- phetic work than we could obtain concerning Amos from the data in his book.* _ It is important, however, not to make use of later material in forming this estimate. We are to put aside, without hesitation, 17 1-2) 29 46.7.10.1416. 18-3 45 This leaves us (v. pp. 205 ff.) the story of Gomer’s harlotry (17* 8), the story, continued, of her purchase as a slave, and her retention “ many days,” 3. While 2°** 49% 8:f38.7 are from the prophet’s own hand, they furnish us light upon his life only as this may be reflected in his own interpretation of that life in connection with Yahweh and Israel.
(1) The story is this: He marries a woman who, afterward, proves unfaithful to him. At the birth of the first son (whose father is another than Hosea, although the latter is as yet ignorant of his wife’s infidelity), Hosea calls him Jezreel (p. 211), a name of symbolical character (cf. the names of Isaiah’s children). When the next child, a daughter, comes (also in sin), Hosea, now cognizant of his wife’s unfaithfulness, names the child JWo-dove. Still another son is born, who is called by Hosea LVot-my- Kin. The woman, it would seem, now leaves home and falls into the hands of some man whose slave-concubine she becomes. But Hosea, who has loved her from the beginning and in spite of all her shame, purchases her at the price of a slave. The relation- ship of wife, however, is not reéstablished ; how could it be? She is placed where she will, in discipline, be shut off from inter- course with men, even from the legitimate intercourse with her husband. This period of seclusion will last “ many days.” How long? No indication is given.
(2) It is to be especially noticed that (2) the conclusion of the story is not given us. We do not know whether in the end she was finally restored to full companionship. (4) While according to Israelitish law and custom the wife was a part of the possessions or property of the husband, and the mar- riage relation was based upon this idea, in Hosea’s case the relationship was one of love, so strong that it forced him to do unheard-of things. (c) The period required for these transactions must’ have covered six or seven years. (@) The “tragic isolation” of Hosea through all these years is clearly evi-

cxliv INTRODUCTION
dent. (¢) The feeling which suggests the naming of the first child is widely different from that connected with the naming of the second and third children.
(3) The truth of these representations concerning the domestic life of Hosea rests partly upon the general interpretation of the narrative which is adopted, and partly upon our acceptance of 3 as belonging to the original narrative. (a) Concerning the general interpretation and the objections to it, v. pp. 208-210. But these objections are largely imaginary; for it is pure assumption that a call to prophesy may come only in a vision, and that con- sequently this must be a vision. The years required for all these events need not have exceeded six or seven (v.s.), leaving abundant time for prophetic ac- tivity. The fundamental point to be noted is that the principal contribution of the domestic experience was not the message concerning the destruction of Israel, but that concerning the great love of Yahweh in spite of faithlessness. It is just as easy to suppose that the prophet kept Gomer in his house after be- coming cognizant of her infidelity, as to suppose that he imagined himself so doing. The fact that Gomer’s infidelity did not develop until after the mar- riage is not ignored in the text, but plainly indicated in the use of the phrase wife of whoredoms (17) rather than nt (p. 207). The usage of speech, as well as the psychological conception involved in the command of Yahweh to marry a woman, who, as Yahweh knows, will break her marriage vows, is to be compared with representations concerning the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart (Ex. 10! 112° 14#), and the commission to Isaiah (6°f-), these being really not commands, but events which in the light of later history are so interpreted. Still further, it was not the purpose of the marriage to teach that Yahweh was Israel’s husband, nor is it so to be understood ; it was rather to teach the wonderful ove on the part of one who was released from all obligations of nature or contract. Moreover, we may well understand that this experience, which was primarily a revelation to Hosea, also served in the prophet’s work as a means of communicating to the people the thought which it first con- veyed to the prophet himself. (4) In opposition to the view that 3!“ is from a later hand and to be treated wholly as allegory, I would urge (in addition to what has been said, p. 217) that the change in conception from the land as Yahweh’s bride (12 and chap. 2) to the sons of Israel is only a rhetorical effort toward personification and individualization, common enough and thor- oughly Hebraic. The phrase other Gods (3}) refers to the Baalim (p. 218), whose existence Hosea, as well as Amos, certainly recognized (p. exlviii f.), whatever may have been his feeling toward the images of Yahweh. It is unquestionable that the later utterances of Hosea are permeated through and through with the idea of Yahweh’s love (p. cxlix), notwithstanding the large place occupied also by the opposite conception, viz. Yahweh’s righteous indig- nation. There is really nothing tangible that has been offered by any one to prove the later date of chap. 3.
(4) The consideration of this domestic experience as the basis of the prophet’s call or of his preparation for his message belongs properly under
THE PERSONAL LIFE OF HOSEA cxlv
the topic of his message (v.7.); but in this connection two things may be mentioned: (@) The narrative of this experience, written some time after- ward, shows, as do the similar cases of Isaiah (chap. 6) and Jeremiah (chap. 1), that the prophet has interpreted into the narrative much of his later ex- perience. In other words, the logical order was the experience, the great truth which it suggested, the narration of the experience in the light of this truth. (4) This is exactly analogous to the case of Amos; for while the one heard the voice of God in the rising Assyrian situation, which itself was the occasion of both the form and the content of his visions, the other heard it in the ruin of his home. It was in neither case merely a vision, but rather a psychological experience extending over a considerable period.
(5) The basis of the prophet’s own interpretation of his experience was found in that most common Semitic conception that the national deity was the husband of the land; but he puts an entirely new thought into the old form of the conception (v.z.). Love, as such, was not a necessary accom- paniment of marriage in the olden times. Here the entire emphasis is placed upon this phase of the marriage experience.
5. If one can imagine a character almost the opposite of that of Amos, he will have pictured Hosea to himself. (1) This picture, however, would be misleading if Hosea were thought of as weak. In this particular, as in all others, he was not inferior to Amos; but his strength was of another kind. It was that of endurance under incalculable agony ; and also of persistence against the com- bined forces of the leaders of his times. (2) His character was as complex as that of Amos was simple. There is manifestation every- where of contending and conflicting feelings; of tenderness side by side with indignation, of love and hate commingled ; of leniency passing swiftly into severity and the reverse, and of hope for the future actually turning before the gaze into an almost absolute despair. “The swift transition, the fragmentary, unbalanced utter- ance, the half-developed allusions, that make his prophecy so difficult to the commentator, express the agony of this inward conflict.” * (3) This means a nature strongly emotional. So true is this of Hosea (cf. the strikingly parallel case of Jeremiah) that not infrequently he seems to lose his self-control, and to become subject to these same emotions. (4) One side of this emotional nature is seen in his affectionate character, of which the entire family story is an expression. The depth of his affec-

exlvi INTRODUCTION
tion, the gentleness which characterized it, and, likewise, the passion, of which a glimpse is now and then obtained, all point to a personality unique in Old Testament history. (5) Still another phase, closely associated with the emotional, is his strongly marked religious temperament, in contrast with the ethical, as it is seen in Amos. ‘Amos is the stern moralist ; Hosea is the man of religious affection. Amos sees the righteous will of Yah- weh pronouncing and executing judgment upon Israel ; Hosea has a vision of the loving heart of Yahweh grieving over his erring children.” * (6) But Hosea was not illogical, as he has so fre- quently been represented. His ability, notwithstanding conflicting feelings, to give expression to a system of theology which was to serve henceforth as the basis of all Israelitish thought, is a factor worthy of consideration in any estimate of his character. He was, in a strange and true sense, a typical Israelite, and his thought, as time shows, was the thought which Israel would accept. This must have come about, at least in part, because his character was fundamentally the Israelitish character, viz. strong, complex, emotional, religious.
§ 17. THE MESSAGE OF HOSEA.
Hosea’s message is hardly less important than that of Amos. The special interest lies in three facts, viz.: \(1) the personal element which pervades it throughout, for one feels that, after all, the message is not so much a part of the political situa- tion, nor, indeed, of the religious, as the man himself; (2) the supplementary relation which it sustains to that of Amos, both together giving the two sides of one great conception ; (3) the fact that in connection with the delivery of this message the end of Northern Israel is rapidly approaching, for within a dozen years all will be over.
1. The general thought of Hosea’s message is summed up briefly in connection with a very few propositions: (a) Israel is wicked through and through, and her condition morally is that of rottenness. (4) Israel is politically doomed, the last stages of decay having now been reached. (¢) Yahweh is Israel’s father,
 
* H. P. Smith, O. 7. Hist. 221.
THE MESSAGE OF HOSEA cxlvii
with all a father’s love and interest ; he is Israel’s husband, with all a husband’s love and devotion. (d@) Israel fails to comprehend Yahweh ; has a totally wrong conception of him ; in short, Israel does not know Yahweh. (¢) Israel deceives herself in her acts of repentance ; but there is a repentance which consists in turning back to Yahweh.* (/) Israel’s present attitude toward Yahweh's love means, in the end, her total destruction.
2. The question of insertions sustains even a closer relation to the message of Hosea than in the case of Amos. (For the passages which a scientific criticism denies to the original utterance, v.2. p. clx, and for the considerations which have led to the opinion thus expressed, v. each passage iz loc. as well as p. clix.) There is involved in this, especially, the question whether to Hosea or to later writers we shall ascribe the strongly expressed teaching of Israel’s restoration, which is found in the book as it is now constituted. The most careful consideration seems to show that this thought is non-Hoseanic
(p. clix).
3. Again it may be said: Hosea followed Amos. But what did that signify? What did Amos do that Hosea need not do again? What did Amos leave undone, which Hosea must now do? f Amos aroused the conscience of Israel to a perception of the real state of affairs ; but, aside from the most general injunction, Seek Yahweh and ye shall live (Am. 5*), he refers neither to a restoration (9? being late) nor to any plan for securing such a restoration. That Yahweh loved his people, and had manifested this love on many occasions of great national importance, was evident. This love was indeed the basis in some measure of the ethical develop- ment thus far wrought out. But although this love was already recognized, there remained, in view of the emphasis which Amos lays on universal law, another problem to be solved, viz., “to prove in God so great and new a mercy as was capable of matching that law,” { in other words, it is necessary for a prophet “to arise with as keen a conscience of law as Amos himself, and yet affirm that love was greater still; to admit that Israel was doomed, and yet” (not “ promise their redemption,” but) show that redemption, z.e. repentance, is possible; and that the basis
* A later writer (127) includes also the maintaining of true love and justice, and the waiting continually on God. t GAS. I. 227 ff. t GAS. I. 229.
cxlviii INTRODUCTION
of this redemption is as fundamental as is the basis of law itself. This was what Hosea had to do; and in doing it he is marking out the lines (v.s.) of all subsequent prophecy. 3\4 (v. being late) clearly involves (@) Israel’s continued relationship with Yahweh, (6) her days of punishment for the sake of discipline, (¢) her acquisition of a new spirit and her return or redemption ; but, while (a) and (4) are definitely expressed, (c) is only implied. This was left so, because the means and method were outside of Hosea’s vision ; not so, however, the fact and its philosophy.
4. The circumstances of Hosea’s earlier life were practically the same as those under which Amos worked. But in the later period of his ministry everything had changed (v.s.). We are not to suppose, however, that the popular feeling (pp. cx ff.) on fundamental questions had been greatly altered. Hosea takes cognizance of certain phases of this opinion which Amos seems not to have noticed, e.g. image-worship, the platforms of the two great political parties, the national feeling as to the past history of the nation. These and other subjects constituting the popular usage or opinion which Hosea opposed will be taken up briefly in connection with the statement of his convictions (7.2.).
5. Hosea, when compared with Amos, is found to deal very differently with the same question. While Amos was broader, Hosea goes deeper; Amos is controlled solely by the ethical spirit, Hosea by the religious spirit. The more important details are the following : —
(1) The god of Hosea was omnipotent as truly as was that of Amos; but this idea of power occupies no such place in Hosea’s thought as in that of Amos.
(2) Yahweh’s power over nature is seen in the fact that not Baal, but Yahweh, had been the giver of Israel’s gifts (2°), in the affliction which the land and the beasts thereof are soon to suffer (43 92), as well as in the control of Sheol itself (134). In history his hand has wrought many wonderful things which have occurred in Israel’s own life as a nation (e.g. the deliverance from Egypt, 11! 129 1345; tender guidance in their early history, 1134; the sending of prophets, 121°); but Hosea exhibits no interest in the work of Yahweh outside of Israel.
(4) Was Hosea more truly a monotheist than was Amos? It cannot be said that Hosea has a narrower conception of the
THE MESSAGE OF HOSEA cxlix
deity ; but for him, as for his predecessor, Yahweh is a national god (3* 9° 13*), especially concerned with a single nation. His representation of this god, now as the light (6°), again as a lion (5** 13’), or a gnawing worm (57), vividly expresses the writer’s conception of the divine attitude and power. The anthropomor- phism is strong and startling. Yahweh is always represented as speaking, there being only a single case in chaps. 4-14 of an in- troductory formula (4"). The representations of love on Yahweh’s part (especially those of the father and the husband), and those also of indignation and threatened destruction (5 ™* 12" 137*) bespeak a poetic nature, but at the same time present ideas of the deity of a peculiarly fundamental character (v.s.).
(¢) The image-worship of these times, passed over in silence by Elijah, Elisha, and Amos (p. cxvi), is the subject of “ incessant polemic ” on the part of Hosea (8*°; cf. 1 K. 12% Ex. 32*). This idea, not altogether new (cf. the decalogues, pp. lviii ff.), plays a large part in Hosea’s conception. Hosea, looking deeper than those who preceded, sees in the traditional Yahweh-worship of his times what he believes to be the worship of other gods (3'; v.s.). Yahweh regards it as sinful to make idols or to worship them (13”), and all this applies to the calf-worship of Hosea’s times. Why was it Hosea rather than Amos who took this position? Because, as W. Robertson Smith has suggested,* while Amos looked at the national practices from the ethical point of view and that of the administration of justice, Hosea thought of them rather as they affected the personal relation of the nation to Yahweh himself. Israel, in idol-worship, shows no true conception of the love due Yahweh. She is, in fact, an adulteress. The worship given the calves is morally false, and therefore inadequate and injurious (v.7.).
(2) The fundamental idea of Hosea is his conception of Yahweh as a god of love (31 11"*). The word sn Jove, kindness, “eal love ” (never found in Amos), represents an act or feeling of dutiful or loyal affection (6** 10”), There is a relationship (6’) between Yahweh and Israel which calls upon both to exercise this feeling toward each other. The obligation is not merely a legal one; it is likewise moral. We may not overlook the fact that, although
 
* Proph. 176f.
cl INTRODUCTION
this relationship is in one sense multiform (viz. grace on the part of Yahweh to Israel, piety on the part of Israel to Yahweh, and dove [equivalent to humanity] on the part of one Israelite to another), this multiformity was lost in the unity of the conception. Yahweh is not only the head of a state demanding justice, he is the head (i.e. the father) of a family, for which he has a deep and never ending love. This love is the basis and the principal factor of religion. Because Yahweh loves Israel, Israel should be true to him, z.e. moral.*
(3) His most bitter complaint against his people is that shey do not know Yahweh (2° 4\* 54 6° 8°; cf. in doc.).t In brief, we are to take know as meaning not only knowledge, but also the practical application which knowledge calls for. It is understanding, or . comprehension, but more; for Zo know God is to feel the force of the deity and to act accordingly, ze. to have the feeling (of love, or duty, or whatever else) which a knowledge of God implies. To come to know God, then, means to come into a new state of mind. Now, (@) Hosea is not asking Israel to accept knowledge which the nation once possessed, but has lost; it is something really zew in religion which he is holding out to them, although in 13° this ignorance is rhetorically styled forgetfulness ; more- over, (4) he clearly indicates the obstacles in the way of their reaching up to this new knowledge, viz. their evil life (4*™) and the failure of the religious leaders, priests and prophets, to do their duty (4°* 51*) ; but (¢) if these difficulties should be removed, how might Israel gain this true knowledge of Yahweh? { Through the many deeds in which Yahweh has made manifestations of himself in history (v.s.); through the prosperity and abundance with which she has been blessed (2°); and, still further, through the laws or teachings which have already taken formal shape (4°) ; but, so hardened and insensible has Israel become to these and all similar influences, that Yahweh will be compelled to come upon them in violence and with disaster, in order to make im- pression on their minds. This is the doom of the immediate future (13"°).

THE MESSAGE OF HOSEA cli
(4) While the exact relation of Yahweh to Israel,* represented under the various figures described above, is that of a covenant (6’), or a marriage (2°* 3!*), or that of father and son (11'*), what does Hosea understand his relation to be to the outside nations? To this question no definite answer can be given. As has been noted, Hosea concerns himself little with the world outside. He realizes that there is such a world; he teaches that Egypt and Assyria will be used in the chastisement of Israel ; he gives, therefore, a place of superiority to Yahweh over the nations and over their gods. Further than this he does not go. This is in accord with the general fact that Hosea, unlike Amos, is not interested in state or nation history. He thinks of Israel, not as a state, but as a family ; not so much as a government, but as an individual, either child or wife. It is everywhere the personal attitude that is made most of.
(5) The substance of Hosea’s message on the cultus (43* 68 88, 10 throughout, 13'*) is the same as that of Amos (p. cxix), and need not be dwelt upon.t It is only to be noted, as above, that because so much emphasis is placed upon the personal element, the faith- lessness of Israel in the matter of acts of worship appears all the greater. The physical and sensual character of the cultus, taken over from the Canaanitish worship of the Baalim, was wholly foreign and repugnant to Hosea’s conception of the truly spiritual relation of Yahweh to his people. His opposition to the calf-worship in particular was in large part due to its carnal tendencies. These things were fundamentally antagonistic to the new conception of Yahweh for which Hosea stood ; hence it is that the denunciation of the cultus occupies a much larger place in the utterances of Hosea than in those of Amos.
(6) The immorality of Israel is pictured even more vividly by Hosea than by Amos. The situation was the darkest possible (v.s.) ; for the land is full of “ harlotry’”’ and “adultery.” The fact that this general immorality is in part due to the Canaanitish influence makes the prophet’s case all the stronger from his point of view. His lamentation is frequently and strongly expressed

(48 5' 398 6f 11). A heinous thing is the fact that the leaders, particularly the priests, encourage this immorality for the gain which they derive from it (cf. 4°). The sanctuaries, he declares, are dens of thieves; while the priests are the actual leaders in crime (6°). Against all this Hosea (a) utters scathing rebuke, (4) makes earnest effort to stir the public conscience, and (¢) preaches son, which means just as truly Jove to man, as love of God or love to God. The strange thing is that he finds in religion itself the responsibility for the situation.
(7) The political situation* at home and abroad is treated in much detail. Hosea is convinced (a) that Israel’s home policy from the beginning has been wrong. _Israel’s kings, as distin- guished from those of Judah (8*), are not of divine appointment. In other words, the schism is condemned, and while he does not « yearn for the healing of the schism by a Davidic king ’’ (Cheyne), he sees no future for a kingdom whose religion is represented by calves (8°°). Moreover, while 8* may refer to the original schism, it is general enough to include the kings who come one after another in his own day. His attack upon the anarchy and confusion of his day (cf. 8) is most violent (10°* 7'7 8'™). He declares that society is a “cake not turned ” (7°), ze. half raw, half baked toa cinder ; { that Israel has no leaders worthy of the name ; that the strength of the people is worn out; that they are actually held in contempt by the outside nations. This was the natural outcome of (4) their foreign policy, which was one of vacillation between Egypt and Assyria, one of half-hearted substitution of other gods for Yahweh, the result of which is seen in the actual deposi- tion of their kings and the appointment of Assyrian vicegerents on the Israelitish throne.§ But another political party will not accept Assyrian supremacy and turns to Egypt. Thus they are divided among themselves ; and, whatever unity might have gained, all is lost in this conflict of interests.

§ Menahem held his throne as a vassal of Assyria (2 K. 1517-2; Tiglathpileser’s Annals, 1. 150), while Hoshea seems to have been an Assyrian appointee (Tig- lathpileser’s small Inscription, col. I., ls. 15 ff.; cf. KA T3 264 f.).
THE MESSAGE OF HOSEA cliii
(8) Hosea’s mind dwells minutely on Israel’s past history, which he interprets in the light of the situation of his own days.* This interpretation was carried forward, and became the basis of all later treatment of the past. This fact is one of the most sig- nificant in connection with Hosea’s career; and in the influence thus exerted he proved himself, perhaps, the greatest of Israel’s prophets. We have four great.interpretations of Israel’s early history, that of JE, which, after all, is hardly an interpretation in the sense in which we now use that term ; that of Hosea ; and, after him, that of the Deuteronomist and that of the priestly guild. Just as Israel is about to die, ‘‘ Hosea sees the tenderness and the romance of the early history.” Did Yahweh select Egypt or Assyria or Phoenicia, all great nations? No; but Israel (11'). Yet her whole career from the “days of Gibeah” has been one of con- spiracy and bloodshed (1* 5% 7°? 10°) and rebellion against Yahweh (7¥"). The purity of the early days has been lost (9”). Yea, from the very beginning the tendency to evil manifested itself (12°*) ; while Yahweh has never ceased sending his mes- sengers with the call to repentance (12°*). The prophet’s point of view is clear ; how can Israel, after the great favors shown her, exhibit to Yahweh such ingratitude ?
(9) Israel’s immediate future is one of doom. Hosea has no bright message, for 14'* is surely late.{ If we could assure our- selves that such passages as 1102) #161823 35 710f were genuine, the case would be entirely different. Hosea saw more clearly than did Amos; and his hope for the future of Israel, based upon the divine love, was more tangible and definite ; but he promised nothing. He contributed a conception of Yahweh which made such a future not only possible, but, indeed, probable ; whether he supposed Northern Israel might still enjoy the divine favor is a question, yet it is just as questionable whether he transferred the hope to Judah. He taught the possibility of repentance and the true nature of repentance if it would be availing (2 5* 6° 10”) ; but would Israel, accustomed to a fitful repentance, ever enjoy the true experience ? Hosea scarcely expected Israel’s deliver-

ance from Assyria’s hand. It was too late. There was a pos- sibility, but it was only a possibility. Israel would not lift herself from the depths of degradation into which she had fallen. The future is altogether dark.* While Yahweh’s heart was filled with love, it nevertheless burns now with indignation ; so let the worst come! ‘Shall I deliver them from the hand of Sheol ? Shall I re- deem them from death ? Where are (z.e. come with) thy plagues, O death? Where (7.e. come with) thy destruction, O Sheol ? Repentance is hid from my eyes” (13").
6. Hosea was more intimately acquainted with the nation’s past than was Amos. At all events he makes larger use of it. On what authority did he depend? The documents J and E were already in existence (§§ 8, 9), and Hosea must be supposed to have known them. 8” presupposes his acquaintance with written laws such as the Decalogue and the Book of the Covenant, while the allusions in 9!°® 12°* might well be based upon the nar- ratives of J and E, though the possibility of oral tradition as the source is not excluded here,f and is probably to be accepted in the case of 8% 9** 10 117° 13**. That he was in possession of information not contained in any documents now existing is clear from 11°, and his independence of judgment concerning the past appears in 1* 10°.
7. The character of Hosea’s message has already been indi- cated in the character of the man himself. Whatever one was, that, also, was the other. Was the man a typical Israelite ? The message, as we have seen, was likewise a truly national expres- sion, since its content is the basis of all succeeding Israelitish thought. If Amos’s message was universal, Hosea’s was more narrowly national; if Amos’s was ethical, Hosea’s was religious. There is no lack of the tender and the spiritual element. “The two men are types of a contrast which runs through the whole history of religious thought and life down to our own days. The religious world has always been divided into men who look at the questions of faith from the standpoint of universal ethics, and men by whom moral truths are habitually approached from a personal

sense of the grace of God. Too frequently this diversity of stand- point has led to an antagonism of parties in the church. Men of the type of Amos are condemned as rationalists and cold moderates ; or, on the other hand, the school of Hosea are looked upen as enthusiasts and impractical mystics. But Yahweh chose his prophets from men of both types, and preached the same lesson to Israel through both.” *
§ 18. THe Ministry or Hosea.
In an examination of Hosea’s ministry let us prepare ourselves for something as different as possible from that of Amos. It will be the ministry of a poet, not a philosopher; of a man dealing with his own home and country, not a foreigner; of a man living and working largely in privacy, rather than in connection with rulers ; of a mystic, not a moralist.
1. His call, together with the message which he was to preach, came not in a vision, but in an experience, one of the saddest known in life.f As in most cases, long years were occupied in the communication of the truth which he was ultimately to preach. The experience was historical and psychological: historical in the sense that it had to do with external facts; psychological in that it was more largely an operation of mind or soul, since both call and message were in reality a spiritualizing of an ordinary event, and an old tradition. We cannot be certain that Hosea did not have a vision of the ecstatic order; but there is no testi- mony which favors this, and all the facts are explicable without it.
 
* WRS. Proph. 163 f.
+ To the suggestion (cf. A. B. Davidson in DZ.) that Hosea was already a prophet when the first child was born (as indicated by the name Jezree/), and that at this time he had no knowledge of his wife’s infidelity, and that consequently the experience had nothing to do with the call, it may be replied: (1) Unquestionably the prophet’s knowledge of Israel’s faithlessness and of Yahweh's goodness was a matter of historical observation; likewise, the relationship of Yahweh as husband was an old Semitic idea; but (2) Hosea’s prophetic mission (including his call) was not merely to foretell a coming disaster (Amos had done this); it was much more than this, viz. to picture Israel’s wicked ingratitude over against the love of Yahweh, which had been manifested through centuries in spite of this ingratitude; (3) the call to preach this message was one which only years of experience and reflection made certain and definite.
clvi INTRODUCTION
As the crushing force of the home tragedy begins to touch this man, possessed of a deeply emotional and religious nature, he feels, in the very touch, a voice saying, “ This experience of your married life is a reflection of Yahweh’s experience with Israel” ; and the voice that speaks is Yahweh’s voice. It did not come in asingle day, nor in a year; but extended itself over many years, becoming more and more distinct until he no longer doubted its tone or its truth.
2. He seems to have presented his message in the ordinary way. Three or four details in the method employed may be noted: (1) He gives his children symbolical names, each of which conveys (to all who hear it) a significant teaching. In this method, as in many other points, Isaiah followed closely in his track.
(2) He makes public recital of his disgrace and sorrow, not for the sake of sympathy nor with sensational motive, but because in no other way could he present his message. He thus employs a story (personal to be sure) through which to teach his fellow- countrymen. The unique thing is not the event itself, which is too usual, nor the story of the event, which in another’s mouth would have been ordinary scandal; but the telling of it by him who was the victim of the situation described. That this pro- duced a profound impression is beyond any question, and this, we may well suppose, was the motive of the prophet in narrating it. Perhaps he wishes to explain just how he came into possession of the message (v.s.) ; but this, after all, was only to make the mes- sage itself more definite and more authoritative.
(3) He preaches, as did Amos, discourses (in all thirteen) which were intended to persuade the people to accept the new point of view which he, at bitter cost, had attained. These discourses (v.i.), though modified by later insertions, yet more greatly by corruption of the text, still show the evidence of passion in their delivery.
(4) Still another method of presentation was adopted after the example of Amos, when the prophet committed his addresses to writing, and thus secured their preservation for all time (v.7.). The suggestion of Marti that these prophecies were never spoken in public, but were originally written and intended for private
THE MINISTRY OF HOSEA elvii
reading among the people, lays too much emphasis upon their present form, and, in any case, finds insufficient basis in the mere fact that they consist of “ poems which do not give the impression of having been popular addresses.” Poetry was the most popular form of address before an Oriental audience.
3. Hosea falls in with Amos in the new policy of political action. He holds no office, exercises no direct control. But more than this, he, like Micah, lives in an atmosphere more retired than that of Amos or Isaiah. The latter came into direct contact with the royal power, while the relations of the former were, at least, indirect. It was, in other words, a private rather than a public ministry. (1) His political views (p. clii) were more defi- nite, perhaps, than those of Amos, and they had to do more distinctly with home affairs. This fact, together with the un- pleasant prominence given him by his domestic relations, and especially the political character of the period (pp. cxlif.), made his work one of peculiar difficulty. The prophet must still have been accorded large freedom to have been permitted to speak so freely in times of such political confusion. (2) Hosea’s readiness to differ from the prophets of earlier days, in reference to political matters, is noteworthy. To differ from Elijah and Elisha in con- nection with the Jehu episode was a daring thing to do, but it was even more remarkable that he should go back and pass an opposing judgment as to the division of the kingdom (v.z.). His political ministry thus passes in review the national history of two centuries. Time has shown the wisdom of his position. (3) His attitude toward the prophetic policy of the past is no more severe than that which he holds toward the priests and prophets of his own times (9’). (4) With his political attitude toward Judah is involved the question of the Judaistic references now generally assigned to a later date (p. clix).
4. The chronological order of the various stages in the ministry of Hosea is not even as clear as in the case of Amos, since neither the structure of the book nor the external events make contribu- tions of a very definite nature.
(1) At the time of his marriage (750 B.c.?) he was presumably a young man, and, if his occupation was that of a priest (p. cxlii), his mind had been dwelling on sacred things for many years. At
clviii INTRODUCTION
first hand he gained his knowledge of the evil practices of his fellow-priests, and their close associates, the prophets.
(2) Within two or three years (747 B.C.) he has satisfied him- self as to the doom of Jehu’s dynasty; this is announced in con- nection with the birth of his son (Jezreel). He, doubtless, expected Israel’s collapse to be contemporaneous.
(3) Within six or seven years the tragedy of his life has been enacted ; the real call to preach has come ; the great message has been received ; Jeroboam has died, and anarchy has set in; im- portant announcements concerning the future have been made (in the symbolic names given to the three children of his wife).
(4) During the next six or seven years (742-735 B.C.), with his wife put away (for he cannot now live with her, however much he loves her), he preaches his impassioned sermons, breathing into them all the warmth and all the pain of an agonizing heart. These are the years of revolution and vacillation, of decay ap- proaching close to death,— years without any hope, yet with a faith in Yahweh that is strong and steadfast.
(5) What next? We do not know. It is improbable that, like Amos, he left home and went to Judah, there to put his writings into form, and to include the Judaistic references which are in the present book.* It is probable that he was spared the worst agony of all, that of seeing Samaria in ruins and Israel carried captive. We have nothing from his lips or pen later than 735 B.c. (v.s.).
5. The efficiency of Hosea’s ministry is even more clearly per- ceived than was that of Amos. The fact stated above (p. cliv) that Hosea’s teaching forms the basis of subsequent Hebrew prophecy, the fact that these utterances produced so great an impression as to find preservation, the additional fact that they were so strongly felt as to require for their elucidation and interpretation the com- ments and amendments of later generations, prove an efficiency of service and a permanency of character of the highest order.

THE LITERARY FORM OF HOSEA clix
1. The table on p. clx exhibits a view of the book as we now have it, with (@) the larger divisions,* and (4) a separation of the original and secondary elements.
z. The secondary passages f in the following table fall into four groups: (1) References in Hosea to Judah are for the most part the work of a /udaistic editor. The basis for this decision is found { in the fact that in the great majority of cases no sufficient motive can be discovered to explain their Hoseanic origin, while the motive of the later editor is clearly evident ; besides, these pas- sages in nearly every case contain phrases which are late, or interfere with the rhythmic structure. The principal cases are the following: 1’, exempting Judah from the coming destruction (p. 213), the change of “Israel” to Judah in 52194 64 you» 12° ; 6"*, threatening Judah with judgment (p. 291) ; 8", coup- ling Judah with Israel in transgression (p. 324) ; 121° (11), contrasting Judah’s faithfulness with Israel’s treachery (pp. 376 f.). While Kuenen is certainly too conservative in his treatment of the Judaistic passages, we cannot agree with Marti (p. 8) that Hosea never in a single case referred to Judah; one can scarcely con- ceive the possibility of such a thing. In 4% and 5° there is noth- ing which demands a later origin.
(2) It is impossible to reconcile with Hosea’s situation and declarations certain passages referring to Israel’s future, the so- called Messianic allusions. The prophet plainly represents Isra- el’s ruin as close at hand (v.z.). Moreover, it is apparently an irretrievable disaster (13°) which is threatened. In any case death and Sheol are first to do their work (13"), nor is Yahweh a man to repent (11° 13%). These passages, therefore, are en- tirely inconsistent with Hosea’s point of view, and directly contra-
 
* There is no ground for the suggestion of Gratz (Gesch. II. 93 ff., 214 ff., 439 ff.) that there are two Hoseas (chs. 1-3 and 4-14) with an interval of fifty years, for the great changes between the times of Jeroboam II. and those which immediately followed are entirely sufficient to explain the differences. Cf, Kue. Zin. Il, 324, who gives a brief list of expressions common to both divisions.
+ The integrity of the Book of Hosea was first impeached by Stuck (1828), who regarded 97-9 as displaced. Redslob (1842) rejected 467 74+10; Gratz (1853) made chaps. 4-14 late; while Sta. GV/. 1. 577, prepared the way for Co., We, Che., Now., and others.

dict the representations which are fundamental in his preaching ; | nor can it be shown that they are spoken, either, to a different audience (viz. the faithful for their encouragement), or at a later time in Hosea’s ministry.* Besides, they interrupt the logical development of the thought in particular passages (v. in loc.), and show a definite connection with the thought of later prophecy. This material is unquestionably from exilic times.
The more important pieces are the following: 21-8 (110-21), promising res- toration to Yahweh’s favor, great increase of population, and the reunion of Israel and Judah under one king (pp. 245 f.); 289 (6 7-) describing the discipli- nary measures adopted by Yahweh to restore Israel to her senses (p. 236); 216-18 (14:16), setting forth Yahweh’s purpose to restore Israel to the purity and © joy of her first love (p. 238); 2-25 (18-23), picturing the universal harmony and prosperity that will prevail when Yahweh again betroths Israel to himself (pp. 241, 244); 3°, announcing Israel’s return to Yahweh and the Messianic King in the days to come (pp. 216, 223); 118%-94.103.11, giving the assurance that Yahweh’s anger is appeased and that he will recall the exiles from Egypt and Assyria (p. 372); 147%(-8), containing a call to repentance followed by a description of the great prosperity and peace consequent upon the restoration to Yahweh’s favor (pp. 408 f.).
(3) A third group includes, as in the case of Amos (p. cxxxiv), phrases and sentences of a technical, archaeological, or historical character, inserted by way of expansion and explanation.
Here belong, eg. 4194, “ for good is its shade”; 58, “ with their flocks and their herds”; 74, the comparison of the princes to an oven and a baker kin- dling the fire; 7!6¢, “this their scorn”; 88%, “as a vessel wherein none delighteth”; 91%, “corn”; 9%, “as in the days of Gibeah”; 9”, “in its first season”; 10°, “on account of his glory because it has gone into exile from him”; 104%, “as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle”; 12'4 (18), magnifying the prophetic phase of Moses’s work; 13>, presenting Jacob in a favorable light.
(4) The fourth group will include miscellaneous glosses and interpolations for which, perhaps, no special motive may be discovered. As examples of the kind may be cited: 84, “that they may be cut off”; 8°, “how long will they be incapable of

The internal history of the Book of Hosea was perhaps as follows : — (1) Hosea himself prepared the collection of sermons (v.5.), ‘together with the introduction explaining his call to preach. In this case the explanation of the call comes at the beginning (rather than, as in Amos, after the sermons of chaps. 3-6, or in Isaiah, after the sermons of chaps. 2-5) either because it was only a part of the book and had never been preached or made public, or be- cause it was thought necessary to a proper understanding of what followed. (2) The fulfilment of Hosea’s threats in the fall of Samaria (721 B.C.) must have given great prominence to the book ‘in Judah ; in any case it was known to Isaiah, who follows Hosea ft in using the words Sys px (Ho. 5"=Is. 5”), the thought of Ho. 10° in the refrain of his terrible prophecy on the day of judg- ment (Is. 2), and the phrase onmD ommw (Ho. ov Isha) (3) At some time, the book was worked over in a kind of Judaistic revision. This was not preéxilic, occurring in the days of Josiah, { but post-exilic ; § because (a) 1’ is apparently inserted with refer- ence to the deliverance from Sennacherib, and its point of view presupposes the lapse of considerable time since that event, (4) the inclusion of Judah in 8" reflects the disaster of the exile. (4) At a later time, following Ezekiel and Deutero-Isaiah, the Messianic insertions (v.s.) were made which entirely changed the character and function of the book.

(1) On its connection with other prophetic books, v. pp. cxlvii f.; and on its more direct influence on prophetic thought, v. p. cxlvi. (2) In the apocryphal literature, Ecclus. 49° mentions the “twelve prophets,” and it is quite certain that Hosea constituted one of the twelve. (3) Philo quotes Ho. 148 and 14”, while Josephus + speaks of Isaiah and “ the others which were twelve in number,” undoubtedly referring to the existing book of the twelve prophets. (4) In the New Testament: Ho. 2” is quoted in Rom. 9”* (where the prophet is mentioned by name) ; 6° in Mat. 9 127; 10° in Luke 23”, Rev. 6; 111 in Mat. 2%; and 13 in 1 Cor. 15%. (5) Its place in the Canon at the head of the Book of the Twelve is probably due to its comparatively large vol- ume. { Its right to a place in the Canon has never been questioned.
 
 
* GAS. I. 222 (following Hi. and Kue. Zini. II. 319) exaggerates this charac- teristic when he says, “It is impossible to separate the section, long as it is, into subsections, or into oracles, strophes, or periods.” Cf, Ew.'s division (for detailed refutation v. Sim. 30 ff.) into three parts, (@) 46114, God's arraignment of Israel; (4) 6112-99, Israel’s punishment; (¢) 910-1410, review of early history, with words of warning and comfort. Also Dr,’s arrangement, (@) 4-8, dealing with Israel’s guilt; (4) 9-111, threatening punishment; (c) 1112-1410, a fusion of the two preceding thoughts with a promise of hope. t Ant, X. 2, § 2.
} Cf. the Babylonian Gemara, Basa Bathra, fol. 146-154: “The order of the prophetical books is Jos., Ju.,Sa., Ki., Je., Ez., Is., the Twelve. Inasmuch as Hosea was the first, as it is written, ‘the beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea’ (Ho. 12), we should expect the book of Hosea to occupy the first place, at least of the four contemporary prophets, Ho., Is,, Am., Mi. But because his prophecy is written together with those of the latest prophets, Hg., Zc., and Mal., he is counted with them” (Wildeboer’s translation in Origin of the Canon of the O. T., Pp. 13).

E. AMOS AND HOSEA, § 20. THE PorticaL FORM OF Amos AND HOSEA.
1. The analogy of other ancient literature should have sug- gested long ago the probability that Israel’s early prophetic litera- ture was poetry, and that its particular form was one adapted to its peculiar purpose and function. Its efficiency was deter- mined in no small measure by its capability of transmission. If we keep in mind not only the character of early literary effort among other nations,* but also the wonderful series of poetical pieces in the O. T., beginning with Deborah’s song (Ju. 5), we may not doubt that the old oracle-form would be followed by some- thing of the same kind, but higher in art, as well as in thought. One will expect a much larger freedom in form in pieces which were spoken rather than sung, and likewise a greater variety. This it is that occasions the chief difference between prophetic poetry and psalm poetry.f
2. As far back as 1813 a beginning was made by Kosters } in pointing out the indications of strophic formation. In 1840 Ewald § used the word “ strophe ” in describing the divisions of a chapter or piece of prophetic diction. In 1847 Baur recognized the presence of strophes in Amos, chaps. 1-4. Schlottmann, in 1384, presented a treatise on the strophic structure in Hebrew poetry ; and in 1887, Charles A. Briggs, in a series of articles, || opened up the subject more widely to the English-speaking world. The publication of Miiller’s Die Propheten in threr urspring- lichen Form (1895) aroused a new interest in the subject. He recognized the existence of strophes as divisions according to

the thought, but maintained further that a new element existed which bound the strophes together in a discourse, just as parallel- ism bound together lines in a verse. This he called Responsion.*
Before seeing Miiller’s work, and Zenner’s (1896) somewhat similar arrangement of Am. 17-2", the present writer had pre- pared and given to his classes the scheme of strophic structure (for Amos) presented in this commentary. The first chapters were published in January, 1897, and later the entire book in August, September, October, 1898.t The structure of Hosea as here presented, although finished in 1898, was first published in part in October, 1goo. f
Contributions to the structure of Amos came very frequently in and after 1900. (1) Elhorst (1900), supposing the book to have originated between 638 and 621 B.c., advanced the view that it was written in two parallel col- umns, the strophes alternating between the columns. Since both of his premises are wrong, the results do not prove satisfactory. The theory as to the date presupposes the essential unity of the book, and no additions are recognized, The column theory involves many transpositions, few of which improve the present connection, while some are distinctly inferior. In ad- dition, irregularity in the length of lines is a marked feature of the arrange-
 
*“Tn a case of responsion completely carried out every line of one strophe corresponds to its fellow in the next strophe either with verbal exactness or in thought, as a parallel or an antithesis” (Miiller, Die Propheten, 1.191). ‘“ Along two lines the thought endeavored to modify the form; on the one hand in that responsion appears only partly made evident, though always in the same position, z.€. in corresponding lines; on the other, in that it exhibits itself not in parallel fashion and in like words, but through antithesis and through like-sounding or similar words, which re-emphasize in a greater or less degree the same or similar thoughts” (zd¢d. I. 192). While this theory, which has failed to gain general recognition, contains much that is interesting, and, in some cases, may really cover the facts, two serious difficulties oppose the acceptance of it as a widely prevailing feature of the early poetry, viz. (1) the arbitrary measure assumed for lines, the line in each case being made as long or as short as the theory demands, e.g. in one strophe (Am. 3912) are found heptameters, hexameters, and trimeters; in another (Am. 77-9) are found hexameters, pentameters, trimeters, and dimeters; (2) the utter indifference of the author to the universally acknowledged results of lower and especially higher criticism.

ment. (2) Lohr (1901) presents a scheme which has much in common with that of this commentary (cf. eg. the two treatments of 13-23 and 710-17), But his fundamental premise that the original order of the book has been much broken into and disturbed seems unwarranted. The transpositions suggested do not justify themselves (cf. eg. his third address 31% 41-8 8+ gk42), (3) Sievers (1901) * gives a treatment of Hosea 1-2 and Amos I-3, which brings out the possibilities of the poetic form in so far as this concerns the metre, ze. the tone-phrase, the line, and the period. He practically ignores the strophic structure, although recognizing its existence (pp. 123 ff.). This treatment is peculiarly defective in its failure to take into account even the most commonly accepted modifications of the text. (4) Condamin (July, 1g01) adopts Zenner’s choral system, and arranges the text of Amos (with the exception of 264! 68-77) in a series of strophes occurring constantly in the order: strophe, antistrophe, alternate strophe, supposed to have been chanted by two choirs alternately. In addition to the self-evident defects of the theory per se, Condamin gives no attention to the results of historical criticism, and shows an indifference to keen logical analysis; ¢.g. 5*® cannot be brought into close relation with 57101. (5) Baumann (1903) proceeds, upon Lohr’s theory of the present disorder of the Amos text, to reorganize it into five addresses (v.s.). Aside from the unnecessary transpositions involved in the arrangement, this work is characterized by its careful application to the entire text of Amos of the metrical principles worked out by Sievers. (6) Marti (1903) bases his commentary on the strophic structure of the book, but has such frequent recourse to glosses and interpolations as to render his poetical structure very uncertain. The shattering of 31-64 into fourteen fragments of addresses, and the treatment of the visions and the historical episode as mere prose, can certainly not be justified. (7) Nowack (August, 1903), in the second edition of the Hand-Kommentar adopts Bau- mann’s presentation, but makes no practical use of the structure in his com- mentary.
Contributions to the structure of Hosea have not been so numerous. On Miiller (DH.),¢ Sievers (1901), | Condamin (July, 1902),§ and Marti (1903), the same general statement may be made as that already presented concerning their respective treatments of Amos (v.s.). As a matter of fact, only Miiller and Marti have really given any adequate consideration to this question.
3. The standard unit in the system of Hebrew Poetry, as it is now most generally understood, may be called the foo/, or tone- phrase, i.e. a word or combination of words having a single beat

or accent. The possible varieties of the tone-phrase are four, viz.: a word (accented) of ome syllable, thus, 2, ws (1*) ;* one or two words making ‘wo syllables with the second accented, thus, — 7, Way (1°) or otN"OY (1°); one or more words making shree syllables, with the second or third accented, thus, _ 7 _ or —— 4, bman (1°), t7yJS (1); one or more words making four (or more) syllables, with the third or fourth accented, thts, or SZ, Pree Tres. Gy).
It is to be noted that (1) the essential thing is the Zone, the number of syllables being a matter of no consequence. (2) The Maqgeph plays an important part in combining two or even three words into one. (3) In any effort to express the rhythmic move- ment of a line, much care must be given to a consideration of the details connected, ¢.g. with Segholate forms (in which the helping vowel does not count in forming a syllable); the use of SewA, which may or may not count as a vowel and thus form a syllable ; the treatment of particles (prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs, negatives, pronouns, etc.) as proclitics and enclitics ; the recession of the accent for various reasons; the pausal forms.
4. The 4ne, in Hebrew poetry, is usually a combination of two or more tone-phrases. The possibilities of line-structure are numerous. ‘Those most frequently found in Amos and Hosea are (a) the dimeter, made up of two tone-phrases, eg. 187? 6¥* The dimeter is found, for the most part, either as a shortened (z.e. brachycatalectic) trimeter (1° 28%), or in a combination of two dimeters, thus making a tetrameter (27°? 4'*“), or in the Qinah-measure (57%43*¢4%e), (6) By far the most common movement is that of the trimeter, consisting of three tone-phrases, e.g. Ap maxvoy won (754), weer Sms ws (44%), vars) sw wot (5%*). (¢) Rarer combinations of tone-phrases are of four, z.¢. tetrameter, with a caesural pause after the second (374 5”) ; Jive, i.e. pentameter (2°°), in most cases to be taken rather as a combination of 3+ 2 or 2+3; stx, te. hexameter (v.2.), which is either 4+ 2,2+4, or2+2+2 (5).
5. The poetical gertod (ordinarily called parallelism) consists of two or more closely connected lines. We find a variety of com-

binations; ¢.g. (@) The most common period is the di-trimeter, t.e. double trimeter (1? 4‘), which, in some cases, may easily be reckoned an hexameter (3*°). (6) Much rarer is the bi-tetrame- ter, z.c. double tetrameter (41°% 7%" °). (¢) Quite frequently there is used the combination of 3 + 2, rarely 2+ 3. This is the so-called Qinah-measure (pp. 108 f.). (2) Other combinations are that of 4+ 3 (5%*°), rarely 3 + 4 (6%), 4+ 2 (68%), as well as 3 X 2 (ze. triple dimeter) (6'*°).
6. The strophe is a combination of periods, or of periods and lines, which, in every case, constitutes a logical unit.* A variety of combinations occurs: (@) Groups, consisting only of periods, of which there may be two (3*° 5°), three (518%: 527), four (Hoseth) five (52 F Pat A) vorisix (Ho.\4**5').,.48)" Groups; consisting of periods and independent lines, in various combina- tions, e.g. bi-trimeter and trimeter, Ze. 3+ 3 and 3 (1*°*) or bi-trimeter and dimeter, z.e. 3 + 3 and 2 (1”), or three bi-trime- ters and a trimeter (Ho. 11°”, etc.). (¢) Groups, consisting of lines and periods, in combinations like those given above, e.g. a trime- ter and five bi-trimeters (Ho. 9“), a trimeter and a bi-trimeter (Am. 7**). ;
It is to be noted further concerning strophes, (1) that in Amos the six-line strophe occurs most frequently, while the four- line strophe is next in order of frequency, and no strophe exceeds ten lines. In Hosea, on the other hand, the strophes are, as a rule, longer than in Amos, twelve lines being not an uncommon length, while eight-, nine-, and ten-line strophes are of frequent occurrence. (2) In a few cases the strophes are indicated by external signs, ¢.g. Am. 1 and 2 by the recurrence of certain introductory and closing formulas; in Am. 4*7 by the recurrence of the refrain; but in the remaining cases the thought is usually so distinct and separate as to render the strophic division com- paratively certain.
7. The many introductory and concluding expressions must be considered, each on its own merits. — (a) It is frequently a ques- tion whether the introductory words relating to the uéferance t

t Z.g. 10N) (Ho. 14 31), 1oN AD (Am. 18 582),
THE POETICAL FORM OF AMOS AND HOSEA  clxix
should be treated as a part of the poetical form, and consequently as one of the lines, or tone-phrases. It does not seem possible to lay down an absolute rule, as is done by Baumann.* In Am. +6911 18 51-48 it matters little whether these words are counted or not. In Ho. 1***8 they stand outside of the strophe. In Am, 31! 71.12.1417 they can scarcely be omitted. (4) There is the same question in the case of such introductory phrases as “ Behold, the days are coming” (8"% 9”), “hear this word, etc.”’ (3: 4! 5! 84). (c) The same question arises concerning similar phrases at the end. Some omit them entirely,t as in 1°° 2° 3-4 43 8°. Others retain them. f
8. A splendid example of the refrain occurs in Am. 4*™, in which five strophes close with the words, “But ye did not return unto me —it is the oracle of Yahweh.” Cf. Is. 9*-10* (which was probably modelled after Amos) ; also Ps. 39°” 42°” 43° 460%” 497! 57°! so ?-38, Something approaching to a refrain is seen in Ho. 5° 6°, “Thou, O Ephraim, hast committed harlotry, and Israel is defiled.”
9. Textual criticism has found a great ally in this new work of metrical and strophic structure.§ Evidence of this appears in every recently published commentary. A new criticism has arisen, distinct from the textual (or lower) and from the historical (or higher). We may call this the s¢rophic (including metrical) criticism. By the application of this criticism, (@) introductory and concluding formulas will be thrown out, eg. 15° 2° 3%; (4) glosses and variants are detected, while repetitious phrases and unnecessary adjectives are given their proper place, eg. 5% 789 248; (¢) lacunae are recognized, e.g. 2”¥ 3? 4*™ ia [tsi (d) additions made merely for explanation or by way of ex- pansion are separated from the original text, ¢.g. 14 2° 3h%° 4272-72-82.100 516¢; while (¢), as the most important service of all, the great divisions of thought are clearly marked (v.s.). This criticism, while “lower” (having to do with the form) is also “higher,” since it is largely a logical criticism.

§ 21. THE LANGUAGE AND STYLE OF AMOS AND HOSEA.
Reference has already been made to the character of the lan- guage of these earliest prophets, as also to certain alleged Aramai- cisms in Amos (p. cxxxviii), and in Hosea (p. cxl). The general characteristics of the style of Amos have been noted (pp. cxxxix f.). It is entirely in accord with the sentiment of modern scholarship to designate the language of both Amos and Hosea as classic Hebrew. This becomes much more clear in Hosea’s case, when one separates from the original Hosea the secondary material that belongs to a later age; and especially when the original text of the separate pieces appears in its clearness and logical unity, after excluding the elements which, by their interpolation, have given an entirely wrong conception, as against the straightforwardness and lucidity of Hosea’s method of expression.*
1. Concerning Amos, in particular, certain facts of a linguistic character deserve consideration. Among these are : —
(1) Those elements which point to a fully developed, and, indeed, thoroughly artistic style, viz.: (@) the rhythmical flow of the language, which moves on easily and smoothly in stately periods; this rhythmic factor is very marked and furnishes one of the strongest arguments for the poetic character of the book; (4) the use of chiasm, eg. 2&14 47 55.10.24 68 12 79 11 812 ol; (c) the occurrence of paronomasia, eg. 5° 8? 719; (d) the employment of assonance, ¢.g. 216% 41 67 ol.
(2) Those instances of phraseology or syntax which are either rare or very frequent, viz.: (a) rare phrases and constructions are seen in the use of the accusatives wy (312) and ors (48); the construction of the numerals in 58; the sequence of tenses in »nqwom and ~wonr (47), box» (49), and mbox) (74); the various usages of > in pwad rain (4#), nvdwd . . . apad (44), naw) (84), and wy pupnd (85); the adverbial use of vp in yp.» (725); the use of 2 with the direct object as in Aramaic (63 89); the use of 3 with max in 521 (only here and Ex. 30% Ly. 26%; in Is. 118 probably a dittograph); and the phrase $ axbnn in 527 (only here and Je. 22!9 Gn, 3521).
(6) Among the favorite phrases and constructions are the following: The use of the participle is frequent, especially in descriptions, where it furnishes

The idiom sy 4 :D1x NX> occurs in 78 18 82 (cf. 5? 8'4). The rhetorical question is made use of in 33-68 520. 25 612.13 g8 g7, and conciseness is attained by the use of the circumstantial clause with px in 34-5 52.6,

2. Concerning Hosea, in particular, notice may be taken of the following phenomena: (1) Certain characteristics of linguistic

usage that indicate his possession of a mature and well-formed literary style: (@) While the rhythm of Hosea is on the whole inferior to that of Amos, there being many passages in which the movement is halting and broken, yet there are portions of which | the rhythm is as marked and fine as that of Amos, ¢.g. og 53°.

(c) A number of cases of paronomasia occur, eg. bxyan (14), px ma (425 105), yaw waa awn dx) (415), yop and oypx (8%), 12 and OmDK (916), XyMDy and Dynex (1315), 122% and aw (98), 2 in two senses (115), 5392 and ord, (1212), nyo in two senses (12°).
(d) Assonance appears in 27 (repetition of suffix»), 3 41 (repetition of pr), 4162 51 (npsp . . . np AwWInD Nw, also OwwA NNW), 87% 98% (onspn onsD piapn AD), 10!-2 (may and ninarp), 91 (arnnD DAW).
(2) Syntactical usage, phraseology, and vocabulary: (a) Rare and irregular constructions are common in the Massoretic text of Hosea, but many of them disappear when the text is properly corrected (pp. clxxvi f.).
Among those still remaining are: the ellipses before mas (211) and ban) (72), the omission of the object of 1m» (5*), the force of 1p in 5509 Aapy (68), the construction of oy1771 (6°), the force of 5 in x79 (918), use of 9 with direct object (10!? 118), the force of 2 in yy (13%), the construct followed by relative clause with relative omitted (17), the gender of AMS (439), %Sa with a participle (78), use of > expressing “me at which (9°), and the use of the jussive "D1x (915).
(6) Among the favorite constructions of Hosea are his use of asyndeton (more frequent than in any other O.T. book), e.g. 21% M4 48 7. 10.11.18 56.8. SLs 63:10 712.16 96.7.9.15 yol-25.6.11v.13 y14; the frequent introduction of clauses by any, eg. 416 57 72 83186 1024 132; verbal apposition, 1° 51) 64, and the fre- quent use of }»x (especially with the meaning waéhout), 3° 4 4) 5% 4 77-1 87 13%.
(c) Hosea’s vocabulary is extensive and varied ; though speaking almost continually upon the same subject, he is ever finding new words in which to express his thought. Hence the number of “favorite? words is comparatively small.
Among those most frequently occurring are: 0°31» (12 24 4! 54), mr (1? 27 38 42° 11. 12. 13. 14. 18 5° 610 9), spp (i# 215 4° 14 gis gi 9 128), yy (210 5° 4.9 68 ope 82. 4 927 112 124 5), nys (43 63 ON ANI (33 4? 18.14), now @b 48 Bl4 120); Non (47 gil 122 132); mANxDn (48 9’ 10? 13}2), wy (48 Ge 7 gis 9:9 10!0 129 el) own (425 515 102 13! 141), row (58 610 3-4), son (4! 6% 6 1012),

Jb. 677 4039 Dt. 2°), pw (27 Ps, 10219 Pr. 38), oar (12 246 412 54 Ez, 231-29 2 K, 922 Na. 3), 3p (512, in this sense, Jb. 1378), ro (518 Je. 3018), vad» (414 Pr. 10% 1%), manye (6 Je. 1818), Anw (71!

It cannot be maintained that the peculiarities of Hosea furnish any considerable data toward the hypothesis of a Northern dialect as distinguished from the Southern.
§ 22. TEXT AND VERSIONS OF AMOS AND HosEA.
1. The text of Amos is as well preserved as perhaps any text in the Hebrew Bible, the number of unintelligible passages being remarkably small (cf. 3! 4° 5° 6"? 7”).
The text of Hosea, however, is one of the most corrupt in the O. T., the number of passages which almost defy interpretation being extremely large. Among these are 4'° 57% 1-15 635-9 72.6.12c.16 Ra. 108 9* 13 10” 9. 10 I 1” 8.7. 9b. 10 1 2? 12 13 9. 10. 15 14° b Hosea’s repu- tation for obscurity is due in large measure to the corrupt form in which the text of his message has reached us. That this corrup- tion began at a comparatively early date is evident from the fact that some of the errors of f#l@ appear already in G, e.g. 7°, yiwe, ev ty axon; 7°, Sy Xb, cis obfév; 11°, PVD NID¥, elcercdoomat eis wodty. For the restoration of the original text much help may
clxxiv INTRODUCTION
» be derived from the versions, but in many cases resort must be had to critical conjecture.
(1) In the correction of fA, G is most helpful. That the textual basis of G is different from $A@ appears from the large number of cases in which the reading of @ cannot have come from SAG, eg. Am. 11, nin, of lepets airov=in9; 21), opr, ZkaBov=npy; Ho. 217, mpn, cbveow adr7s = anan(?); 80, xwon, Tod xplew = nwon; 418, oNaD 7D, Ypéricev Xavavalovs. G’s render- ing was evidently made before {¥1@ had become the standard text. The character of @’s rendering is in general the same in Amos and Hosea as elsewhere.* The translation of Hosea seems to be inferior to that of Amos, but this is probably due, in large measure, to the greater difficulty of the text. Sometimes @ is very free, ¢.g. Am. 39-204, minis, x@par; 574, sya mKN nd, od wh d0@pav0d bvalas év rats ravnyvpecw tudv; Ho. 27, pw, mdvra boa por KabhKer; 518, nhbwn, al dréoreiNev rpéoBes; in other cases excessive literal- ness is aimed at, e.g. in Am. 72-5 the synonyms nbp and nn are differentiated; 538, ar and, wa rl avrn; Ho, 21, we ona, év 7@ Tbryw od; the idiom x? “21 DIN is regularly rendered, ov ui) tpocOjow, K.T.r., e.g. Ho. 16 9 132, etc. Inaccurate renderings are of common occurrence, e.g. Am. 61, o:3Nw, éfoude- vodor; 312, nun mNpa, karévayte THs pudfs; Ho. 9), 17339, ws oxordy; 713, sw, Seldaror; 511, Syxrn, Ap=aro; 78, ws, Vvou éverdAHo On.
Occasionally ignorance of the meaning is shown by resort to transliteration, eg. Am. 1, ovspia, év Axkapelu; and, perhaps, 3!2, wry, lepers.
When due allowance is made for the errors of @, there still remain many passages in which its text is preferable to fA. In this commentary @ has suggested corrections of fA@ in
7.156 55.9 ,3.10 .9.26 Qld 8 ,4.10.19 »8. 11.15 41.3.5.9 11.6.12¢c,.14 Q12 Am. 2 Ra BO Sea Owe e 5 6 7 cali 9 9” 9. 13, 14 Io” 12. 136. 15 I 1 3.7 I 2 3.9 I ci 4. 5. 6.7.9. 10. 14 14° 9
(2) The remaining Greek versions present the same characteristics in Amos and Hosea as elsewhere.t (a) Aquila’s pedantic literalness is illus- trated by Am. 12, Bpvxtoera, axw; cf. G epbéyEaro; 216, kal 6 Kaprepds kapdlav avrod év duvarois yuuvds gpevterac; Ho. 218, 2xwy we = ropa; 518, Sixacduevov = 3; 818, Ouclas dépe Pépe =12N3N N33. His fondness for transliteration is frequently indulged, e.g. Am. 578, va8AGv cou, yaa; 7, Ths yains Tod Bacidéws, Dn 41; 212, Nagapalous, 003; cf. G jysvacpévous; 61%, novxwOnrt, 8499 Dn; Ho. 9? and 101, where nyaan is transliterated, though @ translates it in both cases. ‘A. also translates many proper names, cf. e.g. Ho. 41° 5818 918 yo614, His etymological tendency crops out often, e.g, Am. 3), ép06rnra, mn>3; 71, dy.uos, wp?. The rendering of Aquila presup-

TEXT AND VERSIONS OF AMOS AND HOSEA  clxxv
poses a text different from {1@ in very few cases, e.g. Am. 18, 179 for x17 ; 42, ‘ps2 for ‘pray; 83, al orpddryyes = nIWs, PAT nw ; 88, cxeracbhoerat for andy; Ho. 117 125-9131, The version of Aquila is thus of little value for the correction of f1@. Readings of Aquila have been adopted only in two cases, Am. 41° (omission of ) in 025x321) and Ho. 117 (5p for Sy of SAT), both of which have the support of other versions.
(4) The version of Symmachus is the very opposite of Aquila’s in that it strives after an expression of the idea in pure and graceful language rather than an exact and literal reproduction of the Hebrew. Examples of this freedom may be found in Am. 13 41 512, While using fM@ as a basis, =. shows familiarity with @, ’A., and especially ©. He exhibits, however, a certain amount of independence. His rendering involves a different textual basis from JHC in Am. 114 410 88 (all agreeing with ’A., v.S.)3 5°, 82) for n1a?; 526, m2 for nizD; 61, 2p39 for 13p3 ; and Ho. 31 715 89 114-7 125-12 132-6, Readings of 2. have been adopted in Am. 4)° 525 6! Ho. 117 (two), in only one of which, viz. Ho, 117, 19499», is any independence of other versions exhibited.
(¢) Theodotion’s version is a revision of @, and of practically no inde- pendent value for the correction of §¥1@. That he had the Hebrew text before him is evident from his frequent transliterations, eg. Am. I, év vwxedecu, D7p335 77, adwva, 378%. In no case does he furnish a text independent of both @ and f¥l@. He supports the readings adopted in Ho, 9}, 1235 10°, 3p) 5 117, 99.
(3) The fragments of the Old Latin version are of much value for the correction of @. The version is on the whole a literal translation of G, but presents many variations in agreement with the recension of Lucian. Its most significant departure from fA and G is in Am. 1! (g.v.). Little use of it has been made in this commentary, since it was not accessible till the textual work was practically finished and much of it in type.
(4) The Syriac furnishes a fairly careful and accurate rendering. In general it follows @, but shows frequent independence, eg. Am, 1! follows HAT; 1% takes o>>n as proper name ; Ho. 3¢ 210. 2 44 518 61°. It presupposes a different text * from fA and G, e.g. in Am, 11-¥ 28.10.16 32.5. 11.13 45:9 516 61-3-7 75 81.8.4 Ho, 18 32 45-7-12. 18 54.7 69.10 6.8.11 86 gl yor-10 y 74.8 yol.2.5. 10.12 1310.18, Its readings have been adopted in preference to fl or G in Am, 111 311 516 61 Ho, 47-12¢.19 61 76 36 ol p14 1223.19,
(5) The Targum of Jonathan is a paraphrase rather than a translation, and is characterized by its adherence to the letter of the text, and by its theological point of view, eg. all anthropomorphisms are carefully removed. Consonantal departures from SHIT are of rare occurrence, variations from the vocalization of f41@ being more frequent. No emendation has been adopted on the basis of @ independently of @ and other versions.

renderings. The literalness of ’A. is sought after at times, but, as a rule, the translation is made with considerable freedom, and this, together with Jerome’s imperfect knowledge of Hebrew, which not infrequently caused him to err (eg. Am. 5%, revelabitur, 93; 61, factio, mp), and the uncertain state of P’s own text, renders H an unsafe guide to the original text. No readings have been adopted here on B’s authority uncorroborated by that of other versions.
2. The following transpositions have been made: (1) In Amos: 2%, ax pxwa nnn, follows ww (21); 27 follows 28, and 29 follows 219; 212 fol- lows 2!2; 25, pon 395, exchanges places with ory in 216; 2164 follows voy xb in 24>; 315 follows 344; 584 follows 51; 53°, oNTw na, follows AXD NRX3VM; 55¢ follows 54; 57 precedes 51°; 58, iw Ayn is placed at beginning of verse ; 68 follows 67; 6145 follows 14°; 83 follows 8%.
(2) In Hosea: 2! are connected with 27; 214 follows 211; 218 precedes 215; 219 is joined to 2!5; 44 follows 4*; 4124.0 precedes 4; 712° precedes 7H; 85> precedes 857; 9% comes between g#2nd5; 916 follows 911; g}2¢ follows 95; 107 comes between 1082 and 8?; 1238 is connected with 1219; 1215 comes | between 12!endl2; 144¢ follows 14%.
3. The errors of S#@ may be classified as follows: (1) Changes in vocalization: Am. 27 84, o»pxvin for DpNwd; 2154, oop» for wD? 3 576, mip for n2d; 61, 127} for orapi7; 8% nivw for nw, and sovin for qovin; 9°, vin for van, and opp for 072m; Ho. 54, prwy for pwry, and prs for 3973 538, aay for 7923; 68, Ay) for AYN; 7, oN for oneN; 712%, opDrN for O7OIN; 74, snip» for 17103; 84, wy for nby; 8°, o33y »> for ov2aw2; 84, NN for sphin; 98 nes for ps; 9%, nqw for YnNw; 10%, pon for pon; 108, m>ay for bayb, and 12¥ for 132%; 10%, nNwn for nxn, and by for voy; 112, awnp for wD 114, yyy for oyp2, and oxy for oxy; 7 17, by for 5, and any apy for IND); 12%, nay for 13%), and oy for 992; 12%, sya. for yy, and Non for Non; 13}, xv for Nv); I 32, nat for on3t; 13°, wie for way; 137, WWE for WWE; 139, annY for qnNw; 1 325, ons for nx, and wiay) for w2), and 73)X for 7358; 148, orp for 1p.

A COMMENTARY ON THE BOOK OF AMOS.
§ 1. The superscription: Occupation and residence of Amos; date of his work. 1.
The superscription contains the title, the author’s name, his occupation, his home, the subject treated, and the date; the last in two forms.* This is the most exact and complete of all the superscriptions to prophetic utterances.t Although it may well be supposed that Amos prepared, perhaps in Jerusalem, the edition of his sermons, which, with some modifications has been handed down to us, it is improbable that so early an author would have prepared such an elaborate superscription; it is better to understand that it comes from a post-exilic period. { The editor evidently makes Amos precede Hosea, since only Uzziah is men- tioned among the kings of Judah. It is important to note that, whatever may be the age of the superscription, it is entirely con-

la. The words of Amos] The titles of the prophetic books * generally contain some reference to Yahweh, as the author of the words spoken, or some technical expression which implies such authorship (Na.1! Hb.11). This phrase (Je. 11 Hg. 1”) con- tains no allusion to a specifically active human element,f since the words are recognized as Yahweh’s words. Nor does the plural designate the writing as composed of distinct prophecies, { since every book is similarly made up of distinct prophecies. There is likewise no reason to suppose that the original super- scription was limited to these words.§ The Amos of this book has sometimes been confounded with the father of Isaiah,|| but for the most part tradition has rightly distinguished between the two. Concerning Amos see Introduction (§ 12). Who had been among the shepherds] v.s. That is, he was one of the shep- herds in Tekoa; not with the distinctive use of the preposition, viz. he was great among them. Here one must compare i

in which Amos calls himself a herdsman (but see p. 8). Was Amos an owner of sheep, and wealthy? So most Jewish inter- preters, who urge that this is implied in the use of the same word of the King of Moab (2 K. 3*) ; and that if a slave or servant, he could not have left his work for an excursion of this kind; but the fuller description in 7“, in which reference is made to his indigent circumstances, the etymology of the word, and the answer made to Amaziah (7), “Yahweh took me, etc.’’ point to a simple shepherd. There is no reason to suppose that he was a slave.* — From Tekoa| This was certainly in Judah, although it has been placed in Zebulon,t in Asher, { in the south of Palestine, but belonging to Ephraim,§ (7.c. the ten tribes).|| In favor of Judah are (1) the evidences elsewhere found that Amos was of Judah, ¢.g., the command of the priest (7) to Amos to flee to Judah ; likewise “ the exact scenery of his visions”? which is seen from Tekoa ; (2) the references in 2 S. 14? 23% Je. 61 2 Ch. 20” 1 Macc. 9”. The place lies six miles south of Bethlehem (twelve miles south of Jerusalem).** The hill, four or five acres, is broad at the top and not steep. The surrounding country is sterile and rocky, but rich in pasturage. The wilderness of Tekoa (2 Ch. 20”) is part of the wilderness of Judah.tt The preposition “from” indicates that, like other shepherds, Amos came from Tekoa, but remained in the wilderness or vicinity. {{ While the Jewish fancy that Amos was wealthy has no basis, it is just as unfounded to say §§ that Tekoa is mentioned as especially poor to show God’s ability to confound the rich with the poor. Was Tekoa too high for the cultivation of sycamores?

The vision may have been merely a dream, a vision of the night, or a half-sleeping, half- waking condition, as with the Syrian monks of the present day ; or the ecstasy or trance. It is impossible, in the majority of cases, to distinguish between these forms. Such visions came to non-prophets (1 K. 3° 1 S. 28°") as well as to prophets (1 K. 19° Poa3"))-

In this verse, in has its later usage; and since the distinc- tion between revelations “heard” and “seen” is made by the compiler of the book (cf. chaps. 1-6 with 7-9), the date of the expression would seem to be still later than the compilation. (Ba., Hoffm. Z4 W. III. 95.)
1b. Concerning Israel The words of Amos were intended for the North, zzz. Israel, not the South. The Northern Kingdom, there- fore, seems to have been regarded by him as Israel proper, of which Judah was a fragment (1 K. 11%-™ 2 K. 17¥8).* His utterances

concerning foreign nations, Syria, Moab, etc., like the similar utterances of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, were intended for the ear of Israel. There is no reason to suppose that the outside nations ever heard them. In a true sense, however, even these utterances were concerning Israel, since the attitude of God therein depicted was the same as that assumed by him toward Israel and Judah ; and the affairs of Israel were so closely woven with those of the nations named as to make everything concerning them related in some way also to Israel. The fact that so much of the prophetic material has to do with the outside nations, coupled with the probability that no part of this material was given to them, points indisputably to the opinion here expressed, and justifies and explains the use of the phrase — concerning Israel. In the days of Usziah... and... Jeroboam] In corrobora- tion of this statement may be cited (1) the plain historical narra- tive (7°*) in which Jeroboam plays an important part ; (2) the consistency between the representation made in 2 K. 14” as to the extent of Israel’s kingdom and the allusions in Am. 6" (the borders of Ephraim) and 6? (the destruction of Hamath) ; (3) the consistency between the situation which forms the background of the discourses of Amos and that which, as gathered from other sources, existed in the days of Jeroboam. The work of Amos would fall between 765 and 750 B.c.* (see Introduction, § 12, 2). Uzziah| The long reign of Uzziah,t during which there was co-regency with Amaziah at the beginning and with Jotham at the end, was, in general, a period of comparative peace, and of great political prosperity. Judah was probably in a certain kind of sub- ordination to Israel; { the Philistines were severely defeated and

their fortifications at Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod destroyed ; in the south the Arabs and Maonites were defeated ; the walls of Jerusa- lem were strengthened. Uzziah probably accompanied Jeroboam in his campaigns against Syria and after Jeroboam’s death made an independent expedition there.* He appears about 738 B.c. as head of a coalition of Syrian states against Tiglathpileser III. His name in the Book of Kings and in the Tiglathpileser inscrip- tions is Azariah. Religiously Judah, while zealous for the temple ceremonial, was to a large extent under the influence of Israel and the outside nations. The power of the priests was increas- ing, and it is probable that Uzziah was brought into conflict with them and that the mysterious incident (2 Ch. 26%-”) really means that Uzziah was deposed and isolated by the priestly faction. { Jeroboam] The reign of Jeroboam § lasted about forty years and was marked by great political prosperity. While many wars were waged, peace existed during a large part of his reign. In the wars with Syria much northern territory (the district east of the Jordan) was recovered. This was accomplished the more easily because the Syrians were weakened by wars with Assyria. The limits of the kingdom assumed the widest extent (2 K. 14¥*), though the statement that his dominion extended to Hamath is thought to be an exaggeration. || The calf-worship was zealously observed at Bethel and Dan and a similar worship at other places. While this worship was conducted in the name of Yahweh, it was largely corrupt, including Teraphim, Masseboth, the Ephod, and the Asherah.** The prophets of the period tell us tf that this

reign was characterized by gross immorality, inordinate luxury of the rich, and by oppression and injustice toward the poor. Two years before the earthguake| This phrase, contrary to Keil, is intended to mark a date. Since earthquakes (the view which makes it a civil commotion is untenable) are not infrequent in Palestine, * as may be gathered from their frequent mention in poetic descriptions, this must have been an especially severe one. Reference is made to it certainly in Zc. 14°, possibly also in Am. °° (an interpolation) and Mi. 1°‘. Tradition, according to Josephus, $ connects it with Uzziah’s attempt to act as priest (2 Ch. 26"*) and with a shattering of the temple in the year of Uzziah’s death (Is. 6*). On closer examination, however, we may ask, Does the editor mean to imply that this earthquake was a beginning of the fulfilment of the prediction of Amos?§ Had there, in other words, been an interval of two years, a period of repentance, between the last words of warning and this the first flash of the lightning which consumed them? || Does this chrono- logical statement carry with it the implication that his work was of short duration, limited, perhaps, to the one year, “two years before the earthquake,” { or may it be inferred with Pusey from 7” 2¥-¥ that he had a long ministry, and that the discourses were written out only after a period of at least two years? The answers to these questions depend partly on one’s conception of prophecy, but more largely upon data which are not at hand. Jerusalem itself seems seldom to have been affected by earthquakes, and this may account for the lack of reference to specific earthquakes by O. T. writers, this being the only case mentioned in O. T. literature.**

not enough to claim that Amos uses this utterance earlier, because in Joel the effect of Yahweh’s indignation is very much exaggerated as compared with the effect described by Amos ;* or that the passage is not hostile to the high-places but implies merely that Jerusalem is the most prominent of the places at which Yahweh is worshipped.t The verse introduces the entire book and not the first chapters.

synonymous parallelism, are too local to be understood as mean- ing the mass of the faithful children of God.* To the pure and devout worshippers of Yahweh, at the time of this utterance (2.e. after the exile), the place represented by these names was the centre of the national life, as well as of the theocracy. Zhe pastures of the shepherds mourn] The shepherd life of the author (whoever he was) shows itself in these words, which stand in relation of consequence to the first half. The Targumic “ habitations” in- stead of “pastures” has no basis; nor is the translation “ perish ” instead of “ mourn” on the ground of the parallel “ wither ” t well taken. The present tenset presents the descriptive idea better than the future “shall” or “ will.’ Zhe wp of Carmel |§ does not refer to the Carmel of 1 S. 255 in Southern Palestine, || the home of Nabal which, according to Eusebius and Theodoret, was a village south of Jerusalem, not a mountain; nor may it be taken in a general way, “the best of cornfields,” * but designates the mountain ordinarily so called (cf. 9?) on the coast of Palestine, west of the plain of Esdraelon. The word, being originally an appellative meaning she garden, like certain other geographical terms,§ has the article. No part of Palestine was more beautiful or fertile than the ridge of Carmel (S.E. to N.E. 12 miles, 1800 ft. high at the S.E., 500 ft. high at the N.W.).** The greatest calam- ity imaginable would be the withering of Carmel, Is. 33° Na. r4. The prophet speaks of a general characteristic of Yahweh with special reference to an impending judgment. In semi-proverbial form we have the essence of the prophetic thought; the verse serves also, from the point of view of the editor, as a motto or text. The chapters which follow are merely the expansion. of this thought, and the explanation of it. There will be locusts and drought (7"°) ; but the end will come about through Assyria

§ 3. Approaching judgments upon the surrounding nations.* 13-25, The real work of Amos is to preach to Israel ; he begins his work, however, by announcing the judgment which is to fall upon the neighboring nations. In this he has a threefold purpose : —
1) To gain the good-will of those in whose welfare he is inter- ested, and to whom his words are addressed. In this is seen the art of the prophetic method. 2) To show that a judgment is coming, which is to include all nations ; shall Israel be omitted? 3) To raise the question, whether, if these nations, without the truth as given by Yahweh’s prophets, must suffer, Israel shall not suffer most of all. The literary work of Amos (though belonging to the earliest period of written prophecy) exhibits evidence of the highest poetical skill. A study of the utterances of Amos, with reference to their original form, discloses some interesting facts. Since the connection of thought and, in many cases, the very wording of the text, are largely dependent upon the results of such study, it will be necessary in each section, or closely allied group

155.68 against Damascus and Gaza, Strophes of 5, 3, and 4 lines.
1#10. 11-12 against Tyre and Edom, Strophes of 5 and 2 lines. 112-15 21-3 against Ammon and Moab, Strophes of 5, 3, and 3 lines. 2£s against Judah, Strophes of 5 and 2 lines.
The symmetry of the arrangement is not only striking, but sig- nificant. The significance of the variation in form in divisions II. and IV. will be considered in their detailed treatment. The arrangement of Miillert does not bring out all the facts, and his theory of the poetical form of Amos requires an adjustment of the material so artificial as to throw the greatest doubt upon the whole scheme.
I. 3-5. Judgment upon Syria. —In his forecast of impending national catastrophes, the prophet begins with Syria, and charges the nation with sins, as a punishment for which Yahweh will send desolation and captivity.
The strophic arrangement, if the opening and closing words, “thus has Yahweh said” and “said Yahweh” are included, is 5, 3, and 4; the clause “and I will break,” etc. goes with strophe 2, because it: completes the thought of the strophe, forming its culmination; while the structure of the following sentence excludes it from strophe 3, including reference as it does to “com- mon people,” “ruler,” “whole people.” It will be noted that the arrange- ment of 1°8 is precisely that of 13%, Miiller’s arrangement, 5, 2, and 5, ignores the logical connection of the members, and the parallelism of 13%, Line 5 of strophe 1, and line 4 of strophe 3 are shorter than the rule; and it is possible to treat them as parts of the preceding lines.

The country of Aram (07%, Homer and Hesiod,” Apiuor; later Zupla and 9 -
Zvpos, shortened from a Ar. eLadtt, z.e. North-land, as Yemen meant South-land; the root es be unlucky, 3d form go to the left, hence, north) included the territory between the Taurus Mountains and the Arabian desert, the Tigris and the Mediterranean, except the coast land occupied by the Phoenicians and Philistines, and the possessions of Israel, Edom, Moab, and Ammon. The Aramaeans, or Syrians, were closely related to the Hebrews, and in the earliest times they seem to have lived in close relationship with each other. The early traditions, as presented in the Old Testament, connect the two families in the migration from Ur of the Chaldees (Gn. 113! 2410. 29 21748) ; represent the Hebrews as coming to Canaan, while the Aramaeans remained in Mesopotamia; describe the residence of Nahor in Mesopotamia; intro- duce Balaam of Pethor on the Euphrates (Nu. 225 237; Pethor is identified by Schr., KA 7. pp. 155 ff.; AZ. I. 133, with the Assyrian Pitruz located on the river Sagur, near Hierapolis; this, if correct, involves a slight inaccuracy in the Biblical statement that Pethor is on the Euphrates; cf. Che. on Pethor in ZZ.); and mention Cushan-rishathaim, King of Aram (Ju. 38°). The Priest-writer of the Hexateuch uses the geographical term 0% 7p (BSZ. 655; cf. No. ZB. I. 278), the field of Aram. Other references of interest are Gn, 2270 2510 282 (cf. 10%) 3147 Is. 361! Ezra 47#-17f 62f In the time of Saul, Zobah had become the centre of Aramaean power (1 S. 1447 cf. 2 S. 108); and in David’s time the King of Zobah, Hadadezer, was Israel’s most dan- gerous enemy (2 S. 8?f rol6f), The different branches of Aram, viz. (2) pwns o7N (2 S. 8°), (2) a9 m3 ON (2 S. 10° cf. Nu. 1374), (3) pax mayo (1 Ch, 19% cf. 2S. 10% Jos. 131), (4) aw (2 S. 108 cf. Ju. 113), (5) awa occurring chiefly in connection with nayn (Dt. 3! Jos. 125 1318 2 S. 158), were united under Hadadezer, and with the exception of wa, all took part in the war against David. At this time the dominion of the King of Zobah extended to Damascus and Hamath (2 S. 8-9) and beyond the Euphrates (2 S. ro!®), The capital of Zobah was between the Euphrates and the Orontes (the Saba mentioned by Ptolemaus; Ew., cf. Ba.; also BSZ. 696). David defeated Hadadezer twice (2 S, 10!*-18) and gained control of the country. A little later, a kingdom was established in Damascus under Rezon, one of Hadad- ezer’s captains (1 K. 112*%), In Solomon’s reign this new kingdom was con- tinually at war with Israel (1 K. 11%). Henceforward Damascus was the capital city and seat of the kingdom of Aram, the word Aram itself, when not otherwise defined, being used for this kingdom (1 K. 1518 2 K. 5! 68 % Am. 15), Only during the reign of Hezion, Rezon’s successor, was there peace (1 K, 221), For the view that Hezion and Rezon are identical, v.

of Tabrimmon, the relations became still more delicate. A treaty was made with Baasha, King of Israel, but afterwards at the request of Asa, King of Judah, it was broken, and certain cities in the north of Israel were captured a K. 15%), Ben-hadad II. was frequently repulsed by Ahab, King of Israel, with whom Jehoshaphat of Judah was allied (1 K. 201. 223f 2K. 68%; for the view that the opponent of Ahab was Ben-hadad I. v. WkI. Untersuch. 60 ff.; Che. art. “ Ben-hadad,” ZB. ; but cf. Gu. GV. 154). Ahab, fearing Shalma- neser II. (860-825) of Assyria, dealt very leniently with Ben-hadad, though victorious over him, because it was deemed expedient to keep Syria as a power between Assyria and Israel (F. Brown, Assyriology, 60 f.; Kit. Hist. II. 272). When Shalmaneser attacked Ben-hadad, Ahab and other neigh- boring princes came to the assistance of Syria, but all were defeated in the battle of Karkar (854 B.C.; see Shalmaneser-Monolith, col. II. 91 f.; Schr. KGF. 359-64; KB.1. 172; COT. 1. 182-90; We. SV. 1. 31 ff.; Sta. GVZ1. 528 f.; McC. WPM. I. 272-80; R. F. Harper, ABL. 43). In the year follow- ing (853 B.c.) Ahab took advantage of a respite from Assyria to make his fatal campaign against Ben-hadad (1 K. 22°). Hazael, the usurper, successor of Ben-hadad IL., captured the land east of the Jordan (2 K. 10% 13357 )) from Jehu and Jehoahaz, and made a campaign against the Philistines (2 K. 127f), in which Jehoash of Judah secured the safety of Jerusalem by giving him presents. But Hazael’s son, Ben-hadad III., was defeated by Joash of Israel three times, and Jeroboam II. took away from him Hamath and Damascus, or, at least, part of the territory belonging to Damascus (2 K. 13" 1425.8), Moreover, Adad-nirari III, (812-783 B.C.) of Assyria besieged Da- mascus and compelled its king, Mari, to pay heavy tribute. In the time of Amos, therefore, Syria was greatly weakened, but was probably giving signs of renewed hostility.

The pronoun “it” is ambiguous here as in Nu. 23” Is. 43% 48%; it probably refers to the anger of Yahweh, ze. the threatening which is involved in the preceding verse, and in this case the idea is that Yahweh will not avert the punishment which he has already threatened.* Others refer it to the specific threatening which is to be uttered in verses 4ond5+ A different turn is given to the verb by translating it “repay,” “pay back,” { and making the sentence interrogative, although without the sign of interrogation.

finable number of lesser crimes of which she has been guilty, but on account of her threshing Gilead,” etc. Some refer the pro- noun to Syria, the verb being translated “convert.” * Others refer “it” to some earlier prophecy, the fulfilment of which has been delayed, but according to Amos will not be revoked.t The translation “I will not bring them back,’’} requires a late date for the prophecy. By a change of pointing (v.s.) Hoffmann trans- lates, “I will not let them dwell in peace.” — Because they have threshed Gilead §| The country, not the mountain, of Gilead is intended. The word is derived, according to Gn. 31%*, from the Aramaic words meaning hill (53) and witness (vy), || and accordingly was used at first as the name of the mountainous region forming the boundary between Israel and her Aramaean neighbors. For a good example of this narrower usage, see Ct. 4’. At an early period, however, it took on a larger. meaning and designated, in contrast with Canaan, west of the Jordan, all the territory east of the Jordan except Bashan (cf. Dt. 3% Jos. 13°). In Dt. 341 Bashan seems to be included. It stands specifically for the territory of the two and a half tribes (e.g. Nu. 32% * © Jos, 127°). In 1S. 137 Gad and Gilead are joined. That Amos used the word in the latter sense appears from 2 K. 10”*, although even here it is used in two senses in the same passage. ** — With threshing instruments of tron| The read- ing of @ (v.s.) is without basis. References in the O.

To under- stand their use as instruments of torture we must note the three forms which are described as still found in Oriental countries,

Other cruelties (cf. 2 S. 121) were practised at the same time. The cruelties here represented, whether literally or figuratively, were probably those practised by Hazael (842-802 B.c), in the incursions during the reigns of Jehu and Jehoahaz (cf. 2 K. 8” 10" 137),—4.

But the statements of Macrobius and Lucian are without further support and, as Dr. suggests, may be “nothing more than inferences from the fact of two celebrated temples being dedicated to a similar cult”; if so, the name Ox together with the Egyptian theory of its origin, must go: In any case On was the secular, not the religious, name of the Egyptian Heliopolis, We. suggests the possibility that jx is a corruption of the name of some god, and doubts whether Heliopolis was an Aramaic city in the time of Amos (so also ZZ.

The parallelism is exact, if the line, “and I will turn my hand against Ekron,” be transposed from the middle of v.® to be the last line of v.7.. Even a hasty comparison of the two pieces shows that by this change, the lines of each piece beginning with “and I will cut off” are brought into the same position; likewise, in the case of the lines beginning with “and the one holding, etc.,” while the climactic arrangement of strophe 3 is thus preserved.

The name of the Philistines is similar in all the languages of their neigh- bors. In Egyptian it is Purasati, and in Assyrian Palastu, Pilistu, and Pilistu. The Philistines were immigrants into Palestine from Caphtor (Am. 97 Dt. 278), an island (Je. 474), doubtless in the Mediterranean. This place has been variously identified, eg. with Cyprus, Kdpmados, and Crete. The last

seems most probable both from its size and from notices in which the Phi- listines are called oxn72 (@ Kpyr@v) and similar expressions (1 S, 30/416 Ez. 25116 Zp, 2°; Ba., GAS. HG. 171). The view which places Caphtor in Egypt (Ebers, Aegypien u. Biicher Mose’s, 127 ff.) is untenable, although pos- sibly the Philistines dwelt there for a time before their final location (Gn. Io4), A Semitic origin has been claimed for them by many (Ew., Sta. GV/. I. 142; cf. W. J. Beecher, art. “ Philistines,” DB.), chiefly on the ground of the proper names. But from part of the names and from their general un- Semitic characteristics, a non-Semitic origin is more probable (Ba., Wkl. GI, I. 216; McC. APM. § 192). The available evidence indicates that they were probably Aryan pirates whose first settlement in Palestine was made about the age of Ramses III. (Ew., GFM. Ju. 80; Brugsch, Zgypt under the Pharaohs, 329 ff.; Ed. Meyer, GA. I. 319f.). Probably in the patriarchal time they occupied a small territory between Egypt and Gaza (Ba., Beecher, WkI., e¢ a/.), since the early references to them are too numerous to be explained as later additions. They were so formidable at the time of the Exodus that the Hebrews were not willing to take the direct road to Palestine (Ex. 1317). They were either partially conquered under Joshua and some of their cities taken (Ju. 118), the view of many; or else they had not yet occu- pied those cities, but toward the close of the period of the Judges were greatly strengthened by numerous immigrants directly from their original home, summoned because of their fear of the growing power of the Hebrews (Ba.). Near the close of the period of the Judges they became so strong that they invaded the territory of the Hebrews and subdued them (Ju. 144 1511)... We have records of their defeating Israel (1 S. 4 ff.), and only in the time of Samuel were they defeated (1 S. 73 ® especially v.14). Saul had frequent con- tests with them (1 S. 17! 18° 198 231! 291 314). After this time, they appear to have been so far conquered that they are seldom mentioned. Cf. the view of W. Max Miiller, 47Z. 389 f., that the last Egyptian king of the 21st dynasty conquered them. This explains why David and Solomon had little trouble with them (2 S. 8).
6b. Because they carried into complete captivity| Cf. Je. 24° 284 Ob.”. This has been taken to mean: (1) a peaceful captivity, z.¢. “captivity of those who lived peacefully with them, and had not injured them,” * (2) a holy or pious captivity,t (3) captivity of Solomon as in ©, which (although a copyist’s error) is de- fended by Theodoret,{ while (4) Jerome understands it to mean a perfect captivity, z.c. the hardest service ;§ but the phrase here and in v.® refers rather to a complete captivity, ze. one of the whole people, neither age nor sex being spared (cf.

Dt. 23”), or to deliver over to Edom to be resold. From this reference, and from v.°, Edom, in these early days, must have been engaged in the slave trade between different nations.f There seems to be allusion to an_ historical incident, for the definite recovery of which the data are insufficient. According to Hitzig, the Phoenicians (see v.®) sold the slaves to the Philis- tines, who again sold them to the Edomites, the greater activity of the Philistines being reflected in the use of mbm rather than “30n, and in the order of the names in vs.*”, Philistines, Phoeni- cians, since Jo. 3* gives them in the reverse order. According to Baur { the Philistines sold them to the Phoenicians, and they again to the Edomites, Tyre being the chief slave market. For this it is urged that nian, used of the Philistines, means their actual removal from the land, while "x97 of the Phoenicians refers only to their dealing in them. Slavery was an essential element in ancient civilization, and the supply of slaves was in large part recruited from captives taken in war. The large demand for them under the ancient régime is evidenced by the gigantic pyramids of Egypt, by representations on Assyrian bas-reliefs, and by the legislation concerning them in the Hammurabi code; cf. e.£. §§ 15-20, 118, 119, 175, 176, 226, 227. Does Jo. 3°° refer to the same event? and is the event that which is described as occurring under Jehoram (2 Ch. 21") § or Ahaz (2 Ch. 28%) ||? It seems best either to understand that reference is made to both of them and to any other similar event, or that there is no specific reference intended.** Indeed, it is not certain that mv53 refers at all to the Israelites.tt The sons of Javan (Jo. 3°) may refer to an Arabian tribe (cf. Ez. 27", v.s.) rather than to the Greeks. {{—7. Gaza] Gaza was the most southern (2 K. 18°) and important of the five Philistine cities (1 S. 6”). Being the

last town on the road to Egypt, it was always closely connected with Egypt.*
Its situation on the edge of the desert made it important to caravans. It was located on a hill about a hundred feet high, three miles from the Mediter- ranean, and fifty miles S.W. of Jerusalem. In ancient times it was the centre of great caravan routes north to Jerusalem, Damascus, Tyre, etc., and south to Egypt, South Arabia, Petra, and Palmyra. In the Tel-el-Amarna period it was held by Egypt. Early Israel probably never captured Gaza (Ju. x19 38 Jos. 13°). To the contrary effect are Jos. 1547 Ju. 11° (cf. G), which are prob- ably later additions. Gaza (= Assyr. {/a-az-2a-tu or Ha-zi-t2) suffered severely at the hands of the Assyrians in the times of Tiglathpileser III. (734 B.c.). In the Nimrud Inscription, 1. 62, Hanno of Gaza is mentioned as paying tribute; see ABZ. 57; KB. II. 21. In the annals of Tiglathpileser (III. R 10, 2, Is. 19 ff.) in connection with the attack upon Israel, we read, “ As for Hanno of Gaza [who] had fled [before] my [weapons] and escaped to Mutsri— Gaza [I captured], its possessions, [its] gods [I carried away] ...and my royal image [I set up].” See KB. II. 32f.; COT. I. 247.

This has been transposed (v.s.).— Ekron] The northernmost of the four cities named, was of importance because it possessed an oracle of Baalzebub (2 K. 1°), and was on a good trade route, being on the northern frontier of Philistia, nine miles from the sea, in the vale of Sorek, where a pass breaks through the low hills to Ramleh. It was on a branch of the line of traffic. Hence, possibly, it is mentioned only once in the Egyptian lists, viz. by Thutmosis III. It was thus the nearest of the Philistine cities to Judah.—8 a,b. Ashdod] Was a well- fortified city, south of Ekron, 21 miles N.E. of Gaza and three miles from the seacoast; cf. Jos. 1371S. 6%. It was anciently of importance as the halfway station on the road from Gaza to Joppa. It was well watered, and situated at the mouth of the most broad and fertile valley of Palestine. The cult of Dagon was especially associated with Ashdod (cf. 1S. 5 f. 1 Macc. 10® 11‘). From 3° it may be supposed to have been in the times of Amos a place of some repute. — Askefon] mentioned as early as

Letters from its governor form a part of the Amarna correspondence (Am. Tab. 207, 211f.; see transl. of No. 207 in Paton, Hist. 101; Wkl. Amarna Letters). It is mentioned as a part of the Philistine territory in the days of Samson (Ju. 141°), Samuel (1 S. 617), David (2S. 12°), Zephaniah (27), Jeremiah (257 475-7), and the later Zechariah (95).

9,10. Judgment upon Tyre.—The world-catastrophe which the prophet sees includes also Phoenicia. The relationship be- tween Phoenicia and Israel had been very close (v.7.) ; but the threats of destruction here uttered continued to be made to the very end (cf. Is. 23 Je. 25” Ez. 26-28 Zc. i).
The structure of this oracle (and of the following one), viz. 5 and 2, is very different from that of the preceding. Strophe 1 is the same including (1) line I, the divine authority; (2) lines 2, 3, the use of the symbolical numbers, marking the transgréssion in a general way, as one often repeated; (3) lines 3, 4, 5, the more specific charge; while strophe 2 is a reproduction of the first

two lines of strophe 2 of the preceding oracles. There is nothing to corre- spond to strophe 2, line 3, and all of strophe 3, including the closing 717) 7px. This striking variation of form in the utterances against Tyre (vs.?: 10), Edom (vs.1-12), and Judah (245) is to be explained, not upon the ground of a desire to condense, in order to avoid too much monotony and repetition, for it would be impossible in that case to understand why the condensation is made in one case rather than in another; but upon the supposition, for which there is other support, that these particular utterances, viz. concerning Tyre, Edom, and Judah, are not from Amos, but are interpolations from a later time. The considerations to be noted here are: (1) If the geographical order prevailed as elsewhere, from N. to S., vs.*! would have preceded vs.68; (2) the charge made here is the same as that made against the Philistines; (3) the’ 7px is lacking here as in the section on Edom (vsJ- 2), Cf.

9a. Tyre] ic. Phoenicia. According to the usual view, the Phoenicians were a Semitic people, who, like the Aramaeans and Hebrews, formed a part of the great Semitic westward immi- grations.
That they were originally related to the Hebrews may be concluded from their Semitic speech, which can hardly have been borrowed by either nation. They are named with the Hamites in Gn. 10° for good reasons, as that table does not contemplate actual relationship but geographical distribution. The oldest settlement of the Phoenicians was Sidon. The Assyrian inscriptions mention a great and a small Sidon (Sennacherib, Taylor Cyl. II. 38; CO7. I. 87; RFH. ASL. 71). From that point they spread, first to the north on the coast (cf. Gn. 1015), and later to the south, where Tyre was founded as a colony of Sidon (cf. Is. 23!%, where it is called ;\3"n2). Tyre, the prominence of which dates from about 1197 B.C., was first built on the mainland, thirty furlongs south of the later island-city, called by the old writers Hadalrupos (Jos. Ant. 9, 14, 2; Strabo, 16, 2, 24; Diodorus, 17,4; Curtius, 4, 2, 18; Ba. 239). Old Tyre is probably meant by ¥ 1¥30 (Jos. 1979 2 S. 247). It existed at the time of the Exodus, but seems to have been of little importance, in view of the above passage in Joshua, which contains the only mention before David’s time, and represents it to have been conquered by the tribe of Asher, although other Phoenician cities, as Acco, Sidon, were not so treated (Ju. 181). Homer often mentions Sidon, but never Tyre (//. VI. 289; XXIII. 743; Odys. XIV. 84; XIII. 285; XV.425), but both are mentioned in the Tel-el-Amarna letters (eg. Nos. 17 and 18). By reason of their increase, the Tyrians founded the new city on an island four furlongs from the mainland, and being thus pro-
I.9 29
tected from enemies they soon rose to importance. In David’s time they had their own powerful king (2 S. 51), and from that time on are frequently men- tioned. By the year 900 B.c. they had taken the supremacy of the Phoenicians away from Sidon, as shown by the fact that in 1 K. 1681 Ethbaal is King of the Sidonians, while according to Josephus (Az. VIII. 13, 2) he was King of Tyre. On Tyrian coins of Antiochus Epiphanes, we read “ metropolis of the Sidonians,” the Phoenicians generally being called Sidonians. Tyre is often mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions (v.z.). Both Sidon and Tyre are written with the determinatives for city or for country, but with Tyre the latter is more common. At the time of Amos, Tyre, the chief city, naturally represented the whole country. By its geographical position it was more intimately connected with Israel than was any of the other cities. The settlement of the Hebrews in Canaan did not bring them into much trouble with Phoenicia. In the times of David and Solomon Phoenician influence was great (2S. 51. 1 K. 5!#), being seen especially in everything that relates to art, architecture, and, indeed, the common affairs of life (Perrot and Chi- piez, Phénicie-Cypre). After the division, the intimacy became even greater, Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Phoenicia (1 K. 16%), being queen of Israel, and her daughter Athaliah, the wife and successor of Ahaziah, being queen of Judah (2 K. 111), In the times of the prophets, perhaps as early as those of Amos, there came a reaction against Phoenicia, due, in part, perhaps, to the character of the two women just mentioned, and in part to the work of Elijah and Elisha.
9b. The brotherly covenant] From 1 K. 9", in which Hiram calls Solomon brother, and from 2S. 5" 1 K. 5!* 16%! we may conclude that friendly relations existed between Israel and Tyre before, during, and after the time of Solomon. A covenant is mentioned between Solomon and Hiram (1 K. 5”), which pos- sibly contained a provision against selling the Hebrews as slaves.* This was a spiritual covenant as well as a worldly one, 1 K. 57.f It may be an objection to this that the covenant was one of individuals (Solomon and Hiram) and not of the two nations ; + since it seems quite clear that vs.*” are a late interpolation (v.s.). The reference is not to a supposed covenant between Edom and Israel which Phoenicia had forgotten, although Israel and Edom are called brothers in v.", because (1) the relation- ship with Edom was that of blood, not of covenant;§ (2) this relationship had long ago been changed to one of deadly enmity ; {| (3) Phoenicia would not be responsible, but Edom ;
*Pu, t Geb. t Diisterdieck. § Cal., Ew., Diisterdieck. || Ba.

at all events Philistia would be equally responsible. It has been suggested * that the slaves turned over to Edom were taken by Tyre, not from Israel, but from various cities of the Phoenicians or of the Canaanites. This would constitute the breach of the covenant. Cf. Winckler’s view (v.s.).—10. And it shall devour her (Tyre’s) palaces] Cf. Is. 23 Je. 25” Ez. 26°" 7c. 9 — his prediction was fulfilled in the relationship which Tyre sustained to Assyria and the empires that followed.
Up to the time of Amos the city had paid tribute to Ashurnacirpal (Annals, col. III. 86) and Adadnirari III. who says, “. . . from above the Euphrates, Hatti, Aharri, to its whole extent, Tyre, Sidon, the country of Omri, Edom, Palastu as far as the great sea of the setting of the sun, I brought to submission, and taxes and tribute I placed on them” (1 R. 35, 125 v. RFH. ABL. 52), and a little later to Tiglathpileser III. v. Nimrud Inscrip- tion: “I sent my military governor, the chief officer, to Tyre; from Mitenna, of Tyre, (I received) one hundred and fifty talents of gold...” (ABL. 573 cf, COT. I. 242).

Of the former there were at least two kinds, those between individuals, eg. 1 S. 18% 208 23/8 2 S, 34; and those between tribes or nations, e.g. 1 K. 526 1519 Ho, 12 Gn, 26% 314, A divine cove- nant is said to be at the basis of the great institutions of the O. T., viz. Israel’s claim to the land of Canaan (Gn. 15), the perpetual monarchy of the Davidic house (2 S. 7 23° Ps. 89%), and the perpetual priesthood of the Levites (Ex. 329 Dt. 33° Je. 332! Ma. 24), The usual expression for making a covenant is n12 M3, the significance of which is illustrated by Gn. 15. The idea of communion of life secured by eating together seems to have been the original conception lying at the root of the custom of covenant-making (cf. Jos. 94); this fellowship might be established by drinking each other’s blood, or by partaking together of the blood of a sacrificial animal, or by eating salt together, or by eating any food in common. It is probable that the cove- nant was usually ratified by some distinctly religious rite. The full ceremony of making a covenant was as follows: (a) a statement of the terms agreed to; (4) an oath on the part of each party to the agreement to observe the terms agreed to; (c) a curse invoked upon himself by each one in case of failure to keep his agreement ; (d) a solemn ratification of the curse made by pass-

11,12. Judgment upon Edom. — After Syria and Philistia, and in connection with Tyre, the prophet, according to the present text, foretells the doom of Edom. This oracle, like those against Tyre and Judah, is evidently an interpolation from the exilic or post-exilic period. The specific arguments * are: (1) the simi- larity of structure with 1°” and 2*° and the difference of structure from that of the other fuller utterances ; (2) Petra, the most im- portant city of Edom in the time of Amos, is not’ mentioned,t while the names Teman and Bozrah occur elsewhere chiefly in late writings { ; (3) the vagueness of the description of Edom’s offence ; (4) Edom in early times was subject to Israel, and suf- fered more from Israel than Israel from Edom. For two centuries before Amos Edom had been under Israel (1 K. 1178 2 K. 14!). The cruelty which furnished the basis for the ill feeling on the part of Israel came with the exile. It was not unnatural, therefore, that a later writer, devoid of historical perspective, and thinking that Edom deserved denunciation, should frame a section which in due time secured a place in the text of Amos. The clause “and his wrath, etc.” (v.") from the point of view of the inter- polation, is a gloss, merely repeating the thought of the preceding phrase in synonymous words.

11a. Edom] The traditions recognize the Edomites as older, so far as concerns national existence, than the Israelites.
Mt. Seir, extending from the southeast shore of the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Akabah, a mountainous region, seems to have been their first home after the migration from Mesopotamia. Some think it is the country mentioned in Egyptian records as Adma or Atuma, near Egypt, the inhabitants of which were called Shasu, nomads (Chabas, Voyage, 307; Brugsch, fst. I. 146, 216; DB2 I. 855). This region, full of caves, gave them as freebooters (Gn. 27%) great protection, and was, likewise, favorable for caravan trade between Egypt and Arabia, and Phoenicia and Philistia (cf. Ez. 271°, read- ing oN for oN; so GS, and some Hebrew Mss.). From the table in Gn. 36, it has been supposed (Ba.) that the Edomites conquered and incor- porated the Horites (Dt. 2”), also the Canaanites and Ishmaelites. Their form of government was tribal (Gn. 361% %f); but for all the tribes there was one king (Gn. 36%}f) probably elective (Buhl, Gesch. d. Edomuiter, 47; cf. Sayce, DB. I. 645). The cities, in order of importance, were Petra, where two caravan routes crossed; Bozrah (Is. 34° 63!); the ports Elath and Ezion-geber (1 K. 9%). Some suppose them to have been sun-worship- : ‘pers in view of the occurrence of the word 177 (the name of the sun-god) in their proper names (1 K. 1117 1 Ch. 150 Gn, 3689; Ba. 100; cf. No. ZB. II. 1187), but nothing really definite is known of their religion. Edom and Israel were not always so bitter towards each other as in the later days (cf. 1K.10), While this hostility had some basis in Edom’s treatment of Israel at the Exodus (Nu. 20!4-2! Dt. 2!8— the two accounts leave this matter quite uncertain) and in events of the times of Saul and David (1 S. 1447 2 S. 81*), the ground for complaint was rather on the side of Edom. Edom remained subordinate to Israel under Solomon (1 K. 9%), although Hadad sought to throw off the yoke (1 K. 11), and to Judah under Jehoshaphat (1 K. 224f 2 K. 38#). Under Joram, Edom revolted and then followed a period of
I, 11-12 33
independence, during which it had a king of its own (2 K. 8%22); but soon Sela was captured by Amaziah (2 K. 147), and Elath was restored to Judah by Uzziah (2 Ch. 267). For an interpretation of the Blessing of Esau (Gn, 27%9f, which had its origin about this time) as revealing the feeling of Israel toward Edom, see Né. ZZ. II. 1185.
11 b. Because he pursued his brother with the sword | Cf. Ob.™. If this contains a definite allusion, it must be understood, not of Nu. 20%*;* mor of Jehoram (2 Ch.’-21°" 2 K. 8°) ; +. but rather of some incursion of Edom against Israel shortly before the utterance.{ It is perhaps better taken of the general attitude of Edom towards Israel, shown in the cases cited above and in many others of which there is no record.§ The title “ brother”’ was frequently thus applied, ¢.g., Dt. 2* 237 Ob.” cf. Gn. 27% 4. Israel and Edom were more closely related than was Israel with any other nation. — And destroyed his compassion| The rendering of Cyril “did violence to the womb,” referring to Esau’s trading his birthright, is fanciful; likewise that which makes Wan “his brother.” || The choice must lie between “his compassions,’’ #.¢., the Edomites have destroyed their natural sense of compassion or regard for a brother,{ or “ his wombs,” z.2., pregnant women.** Cf. Vater’s opinion, which makes wann foetus. This line seems to be a comment in explanation of the preceding phrase, and its omission greatly relieves the passage. — And he cherished his anger perpetually| If HAT is accepted, “ anger’ may be the sub- ject= And his anger did tear perpetually (cf. Jb. 16°); or an accusative of manner = And in his anger he did tear. In either case the meaning is the same, viz. that of a lasting hatred of Edom for Israel (cf. Gn. 27*1).¢f The emendation of Olshausen (v.s.) here followed, which is based upon the parallelism and implied in 3 and V, and retained his anger (cf. Ps. 103° Lv. 19% Na. 1? Je. 3°), makes a much easier rendering, but one which is redundant, unless the following clause is treated as a gloss. — And he kept his anger forever| (v.t.).—12.

Teman was celebrated for its wisdom (cf. Je. 497); Eliphaz, one of Job’s friends, came from it (Jb. 24441). It was probably named from Teman, grandson of Esau; cf. Gn. 364%. #4, Its location is not certain, but Ez. 2538 mentions “Teman even unto Dedan” as including the whole country, hence, as Dedan was in the southeast, Teman was probably in the northwest or north (Buhl, Zdomiter, 30).
Bozrah is probably to be identified with the small modern village Buseire or Buséra, meaning, little Bosra, although it has also been identified with the later Petra (Wetzstein, in De. /esaja,3 704). Under Joram of Judah, Edom probably gained its independence (2 K. 8” ff.) The text is doubtful, but cf. Sta. GVZ. I. 537; Buhl, Zdomiter, 64; Kit. zz loc. References of doubtful date to Edom are found in Ps. 608-11 (= Ps. 1088-11) Je. 49%? (cf. also Is. 1114 Je. 9% 2521), with which are to be contrasted the kindly references in Dt. 28 237, The kings of Edom before the time of Amos had paid tribute to Adadnirari III. and soon after to Tiglathpileser IIT.

13-15. Judgment upon Ammon.—The list of Israel’s ene- mies, the announcement of whose destruction would be gladly received, included, besides Syria and Philistia (Phoenicia and Tyre), also Ammon and Moab. These two are the next pair to

serve as the target of the prophet’s indignant arrow. Ammon, because of her wickedness, shall, with the others, perish.
The arrangement of the strophes is 5,3, and 3, and the general plan is that of the first two oracles. The clause mpi ova yo3 (v. 14) is but a weak repetition of the preceding clause and there is nothing to correspond to it in the parallel section on Moab (2%), although in every other respect the paral- lelism is perfect. For these reasons we may regard it as a gloss. While the first two utterances (those concerning Syria and Philistia) are parallel, con- sisting each of three strophes with three lines in each, and the third and fourth utterances are parallel, consisting each of two strophes, one having four, the other two lines, the fifth and sixth utterances are also parallel, con- sisting each of three strophes, one of four, one of two, and one of three lines.

13a. The children of Ammon] It was entirely proper to unite Ammon and Moab in treatment, because they were closely related to each other and to the Hebrews.
However untrustworthy the story of Lot’s incest with his daughters may be, the fact which lies at the basis of the story may be credited, viz. that Ammon and Moab, as well as the Hebrews, belonged to the stock of the Terahites, who emigrated with Abraham (Kit. Hist. I. 24; Sta. GV. 1. 113). Just as tradition assigns to these nations a common origin, the law in later times (Dt. 23* Ezr. 9! Ne. 13!) refuses them admittance to the congregation of Israel. Moloch of Ammon, as well as Chemosh of Moab, was a man-eating fire-god, and to the worship of this god Israel frequently showed an incli- nation (Ju. 10° 1 K. 118f 2 K. 2318), These nations, according to the tradi- tions handed down, dwelt together, east of the Jordan, between the rivers Arnon and Jabbok, whence the original inhabitants, called Zamzummim by the Ammonites, and Emim by the Moabites (Dt. 29f 1&21!), had been driven out. But they were subsequently separated by the Amorites, who, coming in between them, drove Moab south over the Arnon and Ammon to the east and north over the Jabbok, and established a kingdom in their original territory (Nu. 21%), At the time of the Exodus the Hebrews did not disturb Ammon, although they conquered the Amorites (Nu. 214f), Ammon, now with Moab (Ju. 31%), and now alone (Ju. 107%), laid claim to the land taken from the Amorites by Israel (Ju. 111%; cf. Jos. 137°). The contest was con- ducted on both sides of the Jordan. How mucu of all this is historically accurate we cannot affirm. Defeated by Jephthah (Ju. 114%), they appear

next in Saul’s time, under, Nahash their king, at the siege of Jabesh-Gilead, where they were routed (1 S. 11; cf. 1447). While at first on good terms with David (2 S. 107; cf. 2387), they later became hostile (2 S. 103!) and were defeated by him and treated with terrible cruelty (2 S. 8! 10, 122631) at the capture of Rabbah. They do not occupy a very prominent place after this, but are mentioned as having been defeated by Jehoshaphat (2 Ch. 20) and as tributary to Uzziah (2 Ch. 26°) and Jotham (2 Ch. 27°). Allusion is made to them in Is. 1114, At the time of Amos they were probably independent.
13b. Because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead | This act of cruelty was not uncommon among the Hebrews (2 K. Sh He rote ie: Krg isa 3 Nag) Ps. 257 5 oCl. ude Va 57f., XXII. 163 f.).* The reference is in every way so specific as to suggest a particular event. This event may have been in con- nection with the attack of Nahash, the Ammonite, upon Jabesh Gilead (1 S. 11), or a league of the Ammonites with the Syrians under Hazael (2 K. 8” 10”) ; cf. the league mentioned in 2 S. 10°" ; y, also 2 K. 13°". To this interpretation, in general, Jewish commentators have objected because of the cruelty involved, and have suggested that nity be taken as=O7 mountains. This gives (1) they broke through the mountains of Gilead, 1.e. violated the law of boundaries (Dt. 27"), or (2) the castles which were strong like mountains. { For ninm it is also suggested to change the text (v.s.) and read fortified places as being more in harmony with the last clause of the verse. — That they might enlarge their border| This was the purpose of the war in which such cruelties were practised. The Ammonites had originally laid claim to this district (Ju. 11) and were always presenting themselves as claimants for additional territory (Ju. 10° 1S.11").—l4a. Butl will kindle| Cf. I will send, v.“ and previously. This expression has been thought to mean that the fire is not only sent by Yahweh, but is also directed by him,§ or that it is a conflagration from within. || — Rabbah] This is abbreviated for “ Rabbah of the sons of Ammon” (Dt. 3" 2S. 12% 17” Je. 49° Ez. 21”). The town was

situated at the head of the Jabbok, about twenty-five miles N.E. of the Dead Sea, and is to be distinguished from the post-biblical Rabbah of Moab, the biblical Ar.
This is the only city of Ammon of any importance mentioned in the Bible, though Jephthah is said to have captured twenty cities the names of which are not mentioned, probably because they were small, all of which is a testi- mony to the essentially roving character of the people. Rabbah was besieged and captured by David, but afterward regained its importance.
14b. With shouting in the day of batile| The verb here rend- ered “shout,” in Is. 154 Mi. 4° and Ho. 5° is used of the cry of those in distress ; cf. also Nu. 10! Jo. 21. The substantive, contrary to Marck, is used only of the joyful cry of victory or attack * (Jos. 6° Jb. 39% Je. 4% 49? Am. 2? Zp. 1° Nu. 10°°).— With a storm in the day of tempest| This scarcely refers to an actual storm,} but describes figuratively the assaulting of a city.{ Cf. Is. 27° 287.§ — And their king shall go into exile| Upon the basis of % and 9, some would read Milchom, the name of the Ammonitish idol, for their king (v.s.). Upon the basis of Je. 49%, where the same phraseology is used, and Je. 48’ (cf. also Zp. 1°), where Chemosh is spoken of in the same connection, others suggest Ao/kam, the name of an idol. As opposed to these, and in favor of the ordinary translation, their king, may be urged the use of “his princes” ; the absence of any reference to idolatry in preceding passages, ref- erence being made rather to cruelty ; and the similarity of 1°° and 2° (cf. “judge,” a substitute for “king” of this passage). || — “zs princes| The meaning will be determined by the interpretation of the preceding nD, either royal princes, or the princes of Milchom, 7.¢. the priests.
The fulfilment of this prophecy against the Ammonites is proba- bly to be found in their subjugation by the Assyrians. Of this we know simply that after the invasion of Tiglathpileser they always appear as tributary to Assyria.{ In the time of Nehemiah they

They are mentioned in the apocryphal books (Judith 5.6.7 1 Macc. 5° *) as appearing in alliance with the Arabs (1 Macc. 5%), and manifesting the same characteristics and attitude toward Israel as in the earlier history. They are de- scribed as numerous by Justin Martyr,* but Origenf states that in his time they had become merged in the Arabs.

1a. Moab] The account of the origin of Moab given in Gene- sis simply indicates* that the nation was closely related with Israel, and also with the weaker nation of the Ammonites. Their language was a dialect closely allied to the Hebrew. Their land (called “iw27, the level, or Jw, 1 Ch. 57°) was a plateau, fruitful and well adapted to agriculture (Is. 16°* Ru. 11 2 K. 34), which was their chief occupation. Its length was about fifty miles and its breadth thirty, and it was capable of supporting about 500,000 inhabitants. At the time of the Exodus, the Moabites had an organized kingdom (Nu. 227™).+ Their religion was henothe- istic, their only god mentioned in the Old Testament being Che- mosh (Nu. 21” Je. 48%). The form Ashtar-Chemosh also meets us on the Moabite stone, { perhaps indicating the androgynous nature of the deity.§ Their Baal-Peor, whom the Israelites were led to worship with unchaste rites (Nu. 25°), was probably the same divinity, known as the Lord of Peor.|| It is improbable that there ever existed any ethical or spiritual movement in Moab similar to that found among the Hebrews.
Moab’s boundaries to the west and south were constant, viz. the Dead Sea and the brook of the willows, Wady-el-Hasy (Is. 157); but to the east and north they varied, although usually the boundary was near the river Arnon (Nu. 213%), The country seems to have had many cities. Whether Reuben and Gad occupied territory belonging to Moab (Nu. 32°48) is doubtful (Sta. GVZ. I. 116 ff.). No mention is made of Moab in the Amarna letters thus far published; but it was probably included as a part of the Egyptian province of Canaan. In a list of the conquests of Ramses II the name W/uaéd occurs (Sayce, Pat, Pal. 21,153). The aggressive character of the Moab- ites is alluded to in Is. 168 Zp, 219 Je, 48242, The Baal-Peor and Balaam incidents are of special interest. There were wars with Israel in the time of the Judges, resulting finally in the defeat of Moab (cf. Nu. 212!-3! (E), Ju. 312 1112-28), There was little hostility, with the exception of a war in Saul’s reign (1 S. 1447), till late in the reign of David, when, for some un-

known reason, he subdued them with cruel tortures (2 S. 8%? 1 Ch, 1841). They probably remained tributary till the division of the kingdom (1 K. 11%). For a time they are not expressly mentioned. Then Omri of Israel subdued them (Mesha stone, ls. 4 ff.), and they continued tributary to the Northern kingdom (2 K. 34). After the death of Ahab or during his reign (2 K. it 3°), the Moabites under Mesha revolted and secured their independence (Mesha stone, cf. Sta. GV/. I. 532-6; English translations of this inscription may be found in Dr. Sam. pp. Ixxxv-xciv; Bennett, art. “Moab,” DZ. II. 407 f.; Dr. art. “ Mesha,” ZZ. III.; Ball, Light from the East, 240), which, apparently, they never again lost to Israel. For the view that the Salman mentioned in Ho. 10/4 as having destroyed Beth-Arbel was a king of Moab, see the discussion 27 Joc.
1b. Because they burned the bones of the King of Edom] The nature of the act is uncertain. According to fil@ the words to Ame follow Edom. This has been taken to mean the burning alive of the king mentioned,* or the burning of one who had been killed or buried.t The words 7o me are supposed to describe the man- ner of the burning, as lime is burned ; { or the result, to dust, ze. completely ; § or, as many Rabbis, to make lime used as plaster- ing.|| For the reading of Hirscht, vs. Still more uncertain is the personal allusion which is intended. Is the reference to 2 K. 3”, the son there being rather that of the King of Edom who is captured by the King of Moab before the battle begins? But (2) a king, not a king’s son, is mentioned; (4) no objection could be presented to the right of a conqueror to do as he pleased with a captive taken in war; (c) according to Josephus, the Moabite king offered his own son to Moloch.** Or is it to some incident in connection with 2 K. 3, e.g. the capture of the King of Edom himself immediately after the event related in 2 K. 3”, of which the records do not speak? +f And did the crime consist chiefly in disturbing the peace of the dead in the grave (cf. 2 K. 238), by burning the body, perhaps, on the grave itself,t+ and scattering the ashes upon water or in the air? Cf. Jos. 7%. The Jews, like other nations of antiquity, considered offences against the dead as most impious acts. {{ They identified,

to a certain extent, the grave with the world of spirits, so that only those buried together could associate with each other, while the unburied, as with the Greeks and Romans, were considered to wander as restless spirits with no fixed abode. Hence, cremation was condemned, while embalming was a common practice. These ideas may be gathered from various passages (Dt. 21% Jos. 107 2 K. 23) 8 Ps. 7973 Is. 141° 66% Je. 36%).* Or was the crime con- nected with some incident of which no record is anywhere made, the date of which cannot therefore be fixed, though probably taking place shortly before this prophecy?f Or is this merely a different form of the tradition given in 2 K. 3”, { and was the King of Moab Mesha, whose character as presented in the Moabite stone seems to be entirely consistent with the representa- tions here made? It has been noted § that the sin is against Edom, and not against Israel. The entire passage, although it is the key-note of the piece, is evidently abscure. It is there- fore suggested that the text be modified as indicated above: Jn order to desecrate the dead because of violence done to (or suf- Jered by) Moab| This purpose-clause now corresponds to a similar clause in 1%. In one case an act of vandalism was com- mitted, viz. the ripping up of women with child, the purpose being, remotely, to increase their territory; here is another act of vandalism, the burning of the bones of a royal personage, and the purpose is to take vengeance, by this desecration of the dead, for violence done to Moab. Not only is 1w5 without sig- nificance, but also the clause, And Moab shall die in a tumult, | ordinarily interpreted as a description of the nation’s death. — The Palaces of Keryyoth| Either a name for Kir-Moab, || a city in the southern part of Judah captured by the Moabites (Jos. 15%) ; or (since where Ar is mentioned, Keryyoth is not found) another name for Ar-Moab,f mentioned Nu. 21” Is. 151, not appearing in

4, 5. Judgment upon Judah.— As the text now stands, the climax of Amos’s outburst against the neighboring nations, before Israel herself is denounced, appears in words uttered against Judah, whose punishment is predicted on the ground of abandon- ment of Yahweh’s instruction.
The form of the piece, if the clause o}).n¥ OMI saba-Wwy DMaID DYN is omitted as a gloss (v.2.), is identical with that of the oracles relating to Tyre and Edom, z.e.5 + 2. Against the genuineness of the entire utterance it may be urged that the similarity in form just mentioned puts the section in the same category with 1% 10 and 111, and any doubt which attaches to these oracles must attach also to this; furthermore, that the introduction of this oracle removes entirely the force of the surprise which the Israelites would have felt; that it is impossible to suppose that Amos would have treated Judah so cursorily, and in a manner so like that in which he treated the out- side nations; that the terms of Judah’s sin are of a Deuteronomic character and of later origin (cf. now xo vpn, Dt. 4° 6% 1612 179, as well as the fre- quently recurring phrases ¢o observe to do, to observe and do, 48 5}, etc.); that the style is tame, vague, and weak; that the term Israel in 2°16 includes Judah (cf. 2°); that the concluding formula ” 708 is lacking, and that the sin described, transgression of the “instruction” and the “statutes Or Yahweh, was too indefinite, not so flagrant as to call for its introduction in this place, in fact, unlike any charges made elsewhere by Amos, and out of harmony with the formula, for their transgressions, etc., since it could not be specified as one of the three or four. So Duhm, 7heol. der Proph. 119; We.; Sta. GVZ.1. 571; Val.; Che. in WRS., Proph. XVI. and Z&. I. 153; Oort, 747. XIV. (1880), 116; GAS.; Volz 19; Now., Lohr; Taylor, DB. I. 86; Baumann. But note the considerations offered on the other hand: that Judah is not included under Israel in 26 and it is inconceivable that Amos should have omitted Judah in his written statement, even if, perhaps, he failed for certain reasons to mention it in his oral statement; that the phraseology termed Deuteronomic is to be found in Is, 5% Ex. 1816; that though the charges brought against Judah are general they are corroborated by Is. 2&8 18 20 57-24; and Amos may have wished to reserve the more specific accusations for use against Israel. So WRS. Proph. 399 f.; Kue. ind. II. 3473 Gun., Mit., Dr. If the passage is genuine, its introduction by the prophet is due to his desire to prevent the charge of favoritism toward his own people (Cal.) The reasons for regarding the clause in v.* beginning ‘1) Dwyny as a gloss are: (1) the comparatively late date of the idea contained in it, cf Ex. 32! Dt. 9!2; (2) the use of 0312 to designate idols, a use which is parallel to that of oban which appeared after Jeremiah’s time (Now.); (3) the
Il. 4 45
awkwardness of the syntax as it is here introduced (v.1.); (4) the fact that the symmetry of the strophic arrangement is entirely destroyed.

4. Judah] Outside of this oracle the only specific references to Judah are found in 1? 61 7” 9".* Judah represents the southern kingdom, including Benjamin, in distinction from northern Israel (1 K. 12”°).f The relationship of the two nations was very close in spite of the disruption, for however they may have differed from each other in dialect, in religious ideas or in governmental sympathy they were one nation in distinction from their Canaan- itish neighbors. The impossibility of uniting all the interests of the various tribes showed itself in the earliest times, and it was only under David and Solomon that a union, even when effected, could endure. The rivalry between the two kingdoms after the division was intense and bitter (cf. 1 K. 12’ "*%# y57 168 > K. 14°"). At this time there seems to have been no special cause for bitter feeling between them.— Zhe law of Yahweh] Four stages in the history of this word may be traced: { (1) direction or in- struction from Yahweh, in general, without any technical meaning ; cf. advice from elders, Pr. 1%, utterances of prophets, Is. 17° 8°; (2) technical direction given by the priest on specific matters of ceremonial observance and conduct, Mi. 3” Je. 2° 18% Lv. 11% 15”; (3) direction as to the general duty of an Israelite as found in Dt. r° 1 K. 2° 2 K. 10% -14* 17 21° 22° Je. 16"; (4) the direc- tion formulated and contained in the Pentateuch, Ne. 8'* 3f 10% 98, The exact meaning intended here will depend upon the date assigned to the passage. The use in the next member of the parallelism of the word statudes] in a measure marks the idea as

consistent with the third or Deuteronomic stage described above, 2 K. 17% This word (sometimes with judgments, also with festt- monies and commandments, prefixed), is especially frequent in Dt. and in books dependent on Dt. (cf. 4°° “51° 6" etc.), and de- signates enactments or institutions whether moral, ceremonial, or civil (e.g. Dt. 7*3 12. 14. 16.17).* This “ direction” of Yahweh and these “ statutes,” they had rejected, had not observed |, a charge which accords well with the feeling of the prophets (Is. 5*), who narrated the stories of the kings of David’s line (2 K. 17%), although the charge is of sin against God, rather than against man. Cf. the frequent formulas, “evil in the sight of Yahweh,” “ provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.’ Judah’s rulers might be classified as (1) the good kings, Asa (1 K. 15" 2 Ch. 14’), Je- hoshaphat (1 K. 22® 2 Ch. 17°), Joash (2 K. 12** 2 Ch. 24*™), Amaziah (2 K. 14° 2 Ch. 25), who, nevertheless, fell far short of reaching the standard in the mind of the historian, a standard (fixed by Dt.) in accordance with which all worship on high- places was interdicted ; (2) the dad kings, Abijah (1 K. 15), cf. 2.Ch. 13”), Joram. (2 K.-8" 2 Ch, 21°), Ahaziah (2K. 8” 2-Ch. 22°), who openly opposed the true Yahweh worship, while Atha- liah (2 K. 11° 2 Ch. 22”) actually deserted the Yahweh religion.f If this representation of apostasy comes from Amos, allowance must be made for the fact that the general prohibition of worship on high-places was still a thing of the future (Josiah’s reign) ; if from a later date, the charge may have been made from the point of view of Deuteronomy. That the accusation in general was true against the Judah of Amos’s time cannot be doubted. The gloss, And their les have caused them to err| (resembling Je. 23°”), is a still later interpolation in the original charge,t whenever made. These Zes, in the mind of the interpolator, may have been the plausible but false excuses which they offered for their trans- gressions, § or the false prophets whose activity in later times was very great, || or, better still, their idols, z.e. something which has no actual existence, and actually deceives; for a similar

idea in connection with other Hebrew words v.7.— After which their fathers walked | An expression used of Yahweh worship (Dt. 13°), and also of idolatry (Dt. 4° 8" 11% 13”). The whole course of Judah’s history was an illustration of this fact. Judgment, therefore, shall come upon Judah, and shall show itself particu- larly against che palaces of Jerusalem], a threat which would strike terror to the hearts of Israelites, for Jerusalem, even to the Northern Israelites, represented in a peculiar manner the Yahweh, in whose worship the two nations united.
According to tradition Jerusalem was in existence before Abraham (Gn. 1418 Ps. 76%). At the conquest of Canaan, Jerusalem (on the Amarna in- scriptions, civ. 1400 B.C., Urusalim; hence the original name, Jebus being used to designate the non-Israelite population, Ju. 19, GFM. /u. 20, 413) was not taken from the Jebusites (Jos. 15°%, cf. the substitution of “Benjamites” for “Judahites” in Ju. 121, and note also the spurious char- acter of 1°), but remained a Canaanitish city until captured by David (2 S, 5°), who fortified it and made it the capital of the kingdom. Under Solomon the city was magnificently adorned with buildings, most important of which was the temple. Between the time of Solomon and that of Amos, Jerusalem had been captured and plundered three times: (1) by Shishak in Rehoboam’s reign (1 K. 14% 2 Ch, 121%); (2) by Arabians and Philistines in Joram’s reign (2 Ch. 2118f); (3) by Israel under Jehoash in Amaziah’s reign (2 K. 148% 2 Ch, 25%3f),—4. pxn] used of rejection of people by Yahweh (Je. 6% 141%), as well as of rejection of Yahweh by his people, as here; cf. also 1 S, 15% 2 K. 1715; cf.in the same sense ny, PX, 31Y, WI, TOW. —nn] from Hiph. of 1 = direction, used with oypn (npn), owpwn, and nysp (Baentsch, Das Bundesbuch, 29-34; Dr. Dt. 62).

§ 4. Judgment against the nation Israel. 2°%. If other nations are to be punished for their sins, surely Israel must suffer. (1) Her transgressions are many, and, above all, injustice and
48 AMOS
oppression prevail; (2) notwithstanding the divine purpose to do for her everything possible, every effort has been rendered futile ; (3) therefore, now, a destruction shall come from which there shall be no escape. These three ideas are expressed in three dis- tinct pieces, each of three strophes, and each strophe, originally, of four lines. The writer adjusts the form of his language to the character of the thought, and the logical movement is thus ren- dered wonderfully impressive.
6-8. Zhe injustice and oppression in Israel. The nation is guilty of a treatment of the poor and needy so cruel as to bea profanation of God’s holy name.
The three strophes of this piece have the trimeter movement. Each con- tains a single verse; but vs.7#948 have been transposed. V.7 is to be placed as the third strophe after v.8 because (1) the ptcp. n‘pwn is less abrupt, connect- ing itself with the subject of the preceding imperfects; Torrey’s statement concerning Amos’s use of the ptcp. (/BZ. XV. 152) is entirely in accord with this; (2) the order of thought thus becomes more regular; (3) the piece closes with the climax “ profane my holy name”; and (4) the closing line, just quoted, sustains a striking relation to the first line of the succeeding piece “and yet I,” etc. Cf. my presentation of this point in the Bidsical World, September, 1898, p. 179, and Léhr (1901), who places v.8 between ta and 7, and then brings together 7” and 1° (v.9 following); on the other hand Oet. 66, regards the first of these changes as unnecessary, the second as pedantic.

6. Though starting the indictment of Israel with the stereo- typed formula, for three transgressions, etc.] this is abandoned after the first sentence. — Because they sell the righteous for money, and the needy for a pair of shoes| The reference is not to the righteous and poor in spirit who, because of opposition to a royal edict, are seized and sold into slavery ;* nor to the corrupt acts of judges in the oppression of the poor, at first for money, and later, as they become more corrupt, even for a pair of shoes ;t but to the unjust and outrageous seizure (se// here being used figur- atively) of innocent men by the powerful for debt, and to the habit of selling the poor into slavery when the debt was only as much as a pair of shoes ;{ cf. 2 K. 41 Mat. 18%. The sin of Israel repeated in different forms is that of injustice, oppression; cf. the legislation which touches this, Ex. 23°* Dt. 16%” Ly. 19%; and the attitude of the later prophets, Is. 1% 34* 5% 101 Je. 5% 228 Ez. 22” Mi. 3°" 7° Mal. 3°. The phrase for a pair of shoes (cf. Am. 8°*) seems to be a proverbial expression designating some- thing of the lowest value;§ cf. Ez. 13% A very plausible in- terpretation || is based on the custom of using the shoe as a “ conventional symbol in legal transactions ” (cf. Ru. 4’ Ps. 60°). One of the commonest crimes of Amos’s day was that of land grabbing (cf. Is. 5°) on the part of the rich, and it is this that Amos is here denouncing. The judges are charged with receiv- ing money for the betrayal of the innocent, and not only so, but also with cheating the needy out of his land. This interpre- tation is supported by ©’s reading of 1 S. 12°, viz. éx yewpds rivos eiAnda éfirAacpwa Kat trddnua (from whose hand have I taken a

This phrase does not, as Nowack contends, settle beyond ques- tion that the preceding clause refers to the practices of the temple prostitutes.

Torrey, JBL. XV. 152). The result is that the two interpretations appear side by side in @ and %, o»pNwn being
II. 9-12 53
represented in each, while #1 presents a mixture of the two interpretations, ‘xn rey Sy belonging to the secondary one. Hirscht objects to this that @ renders 4xw in 84 by éxrpiBw; cf. 2 K. 19% where @ confuses maw with yw and translates it war7jara, and Is. 251° where wy is rendered by rarely. Moreover, in Gn. 31, nw is used of an action of the foot, not of the hand (kovdurifw). Hence only rarodvra can here be referred to oypxw, and since this rendering of nypxw made the Hebrew unintelligible, cal éxovdtd\rfov was freely added by the translators after él rdv yoy ris yfs in order to secure sense for the passage. Hirscht, therefore, would retain fT with one change, viz. ¥N}3 instead of wx3, and, by considering wx ja as the direct object of nypxwn and regarding paxn “py as an ironical expression for money (cf. Assyr. “ gold, the dust of his land” and “the dust of the earth of Susa - . . I took to Assyria,” AB, II. 14, 209), would secure the following inter- pretation: “the wicked already possess much, and yet it is nothing (dust), and they ever covet more of this nothing from those who have nothing more.” This is scarcely an improvement upon {#1@ and, to say the least, makes very awkward syntax.—1»»] A more usual meaning of nun than the above; here a continuation of the ptcp., as the other, of an inf.; H. 27,54; GK. 116x; Ké. 4134, 3682; Dr. § 117. —a4y27 Sy 135) wanr wn] In support of this reading note (1) that {MT is entirely outside of the scope of the author’s thought; cf.

9-12. Zhe efforts made by Yahweh to build up Israel. The present condition of Israel is not due to neglect on the part of Yahweh, for he (1) had taken Israel out of Egypt, led her through the wilderness and brought her to Canaan, (2) had driven out the Canaanites from before her, and (3) had raised up teachers through whom his will might be made known, — but all to no effect.
This piece stands in closest connection with the preceding (cf. the contrast — they had profaned his holy name, when it had been he, who was, etc.), and falls into three strophes each of three pentameters, or six alternating trimeters and dimeters ; preferably the former, since the long drawn out lines picture the historical details given, and form a contrast with the quick trimeter move- ment of ys.l@15 which follow. It seems right to transfer v.!° to precede v.?
54 AMOS
and make it form the first strophe, because (1) this is a simple historical statement and the chronological order is self-evident, while (2) nothing is gained by the explanation that v.%, although later in time, is put before v.29 to emphasize the greatness of the victory over the tall and mighty aborigines, which was so remarkable in contrast with the weakness of Israel at the time of the prophet (Ew.), or to tell first what God did for the nation, and then what he did zo the nation ; (3) the confusion grew out of the fact that both strophes began with 123x1; while (4) the whole of strophe 2 (v.°) grows out of the mention of ‘xn in line 3 of strophe 1 (v.!°). Cf. Lohr, Oet., Baumann, and Marti who makes both 1° and 1? interpolations.

Jos. 24"), but the whole Canaanitish constituency, described by E (of the Hexateuch) and by Amos as the Amorite (v.7.).—9.

reference to different classes, e.g. the fruit being the children, and the root the stock of the population as that which propagates the species.* The destruction, here poetically exaggerated, was not at first represented as so complete, cf. Ex. 23°* 34”; but in later times, and especially in Dt. (cf. 7'* 20% Jos. 11”) it is treated as something practically finished even in the early days. Perhaps the gradual disappearance of the Canaanites furnished the occasion for this difference in representation. —11. Yahweh had shown his presence and his favor in the Exodus and in the Conquest ; but when Moses, the great prophet, had died, who, in the divine plan, should serve as mediator between himself and Israel? Moreover I raised up some of your sons for prophets] (cf. Je. 6”), and, through these, the connection of Yahweh with Israel had been maintained. All this was in strict accord with Dt. 18”, the earliest announcement of which formed the constitution of the prophetic order. Up to this time Israel’s prophets, not reckoning Moses, Samuel, and those sent also to Judah, included Ahijah (1 K. 14”), Jehu (1 K. 161), Elijah (1 K. 17’), Elisha (t K. 19"), Micaiah (2 K. 22°), Jonah (2 K. 14”), and the many prophets whose names are not given (1 S. 28% Ho. 4° 1 K. 13° 20%). Hitzig’s inter- pretation, aroused . . . so that they became, is not so good as the ordinary raised up, or ordained. The phrase your sons limits the writer’s thought to Israelites,t but “lays no stress upon the fact that youth is the time of inspiration and enthusiasm” ;{ cf. Jo. 3°. Nor does the blessing consist in the fact that their own sons have been taken as Yahweh’s representatives, when angels might have been chosen.§ The usual particle (js) is here used to express the partitive idea, some of.— And some of your youths for nazirites | Mitchell rightly distinguishes Vazarite from nazirite.

Ordinarily the vow of the nazirite was made for a definite period ; but in two cases, those, perhaps, in the mind of Amos, the obligation seems to have been assumed for life, viz. Samson (Ju. 137 16) and Samuel (1 S. 1"). This has been thought to be the original form of the vow.** The custom had its origin in an

effort to counteract the self-indulgent habits introduced into Israel by the Canaanites. The law (Nu. 67”) provided only for the temporary obligation, at the termination of which the hair, which meanwhile had been sacred, should be sacrificed (Nu. 6). Ht was also understood that the nazirite should abstain from pollution by contact with death, as well as from every product of the vine (cf. Ju. 13 Nu. 6°). The nazirite (cf. also the cases of John the Baptist, Lu. 1”, and, according to Eusebius,* James, the brother of Jesus) was introduced not as a reminder of Yahweh’s goodness in establishing the institution as a set way for securing holiness, nor because of the similarity of the nazirite’s work to that of the prophet, the former teaching by example, the latter by precept ; t but because it enabled the speaker to deal a severe blow against one of the great evils of his day.—12. Bur] Instead of observ- ing the example and obeying the precepts of these divinely appointed agents, ye made the nasirites drink wine| and so debauched them, a fact which, in view of the nation’s degen- eracy, is easily credible, although no historical allusion to it is found.

The example of one class is made null and void, and the utterances of the other class are prevented, and so Yahweh himself, who had raised up these messengers, is insulted and rejected. Note the chiastic arrangement of the thought. Actual examples of the prohibition placed upon prophecy were not infrequent, e.g. Jero- boam I. (1 K. 13*), Jezebel (1 K. 18* 19”), Ahab (1 K. 22% *) Ahaziah (2 K. 1°*), Jehoram (2 K. 6) ; cf. later the case of Amos (7), also Is. 30% and the persecution of Jeremiah. — Zs not this indeed so ?| Will any one deny these accusations? Is Israel then not deserving of the punishment which is threatened?

This piece, forming the last of the dreadful trilogy, goes back to the trim- eter movement. The movement then becomes short and quick, as if by its very form to foretell the coming doom, In view of (1) the difficulties sug- gested by v.18 (v.2.); (2) the serious interruption of thought between 1") and 13x) (v.14); and (3) the irregularity of the first strophe as compared with the peculiar symmetry which elsewhere characterizes the form of these chapters, there seems to be good reason for assuming the loss of a part of the text, perhaps one or two lines, of the first strophe. On the other hand a com- plete strophe of four trimeters may be obtained by dividing as follows : —

13. J will make you groan in your places just as the threshing wagon makes the ( floor) filled with sheaves to groan] This is Hoff- mann’s rendering,* and is the best of the many (v.z.) that have been proposed. ‘There is nothing in the words themselves, or in the context, to suggest an earthquake.t The writer’s mind is filled with war, the coming of which (cf. 57 67% 7°17 g8°f14) shall make men cry out in their misery. The appropriate manifestation for such grief would be uttering of groans, which not improperly might be compared by the farmer-prophet to the creaking and groaning of the threshing-floor under the weight of the threshing-sledge and its full supply of sheaves. This does not differ essentially in thought from the more common interpretation, J wzl/ press your place, as the wagon that ts full of sheaves presses { what is under it§ or on the earth; || or, J will press that which is among you as a wagon which ts loaded (with stones) presses the sheaves ;§ or, I will press down upon you as a wagon presses that is full of sheaves ;** or, I will make it totter (pm) beneath you as a cart tottereth that ts Sull of sheaves (v.s.). The lack of clearness here is probably to be explained by the loss of a part of the strophe.—14, 15a. Zhen shall refuge fail the swift| Cf. 9'*. The strophe beginning with these words presents, in four sharp utterances, the utter lack of hope of any deliverance. Neither the swift (Je. 25” 46° Jb. 11”), nor the strong (Pr. 24°), nor the hero, experienced in war, nor the armed man, skilled in handling the bow (Je. 46°), shall find refuge, or be able to assert his strength, or rescue himself, or stand (Ps. 102% Dn. 11°; also Je. 46” Na. 2°), when the great calamity shall come. Everything in which men at such times trust shall fail, viz. swiftness, strength, experience, and skill in the use of weapons of war. — 15,b,c, 16. And the swift of foot shall not rescue himself | Cf. 2S. 173 2% 1 Ch.12°. This strophe, omitted in some Mss. (v.s.), repeats the same idea in largely the same words, though differently

Does the phrase shall fice away naked | (7.e. having aban- doned his weapons, armor, or dress which might embarrass him) contradict what has been said concerning the impracticability of any effort to escape?

Against which Now. urges the unsuitableness of the thought as preparatory to v.14; the uncertainty of the readings in Ps, 6612 and 554 cited in comparison; the difficulty of making nbn an acc., and of omitting }77. (3) Those involving change of text: (a) Z will make it tremble under you as the wagon trembles (v.s.), by changing piy to pr (cf. 1 S. 22%, s3pb for nyo; 2S. 248, yx for yy); (4) 7 will make it tremble under you as the full wagon makes the sheaves tremble, with ~yny as object, and ab omitted (Gun.). (4) py = Arab, ‘om withdraw, flee away; I will cause
your place to yield as the wagon breaks down that is full, etc. (Hi.’s later view), the reference being to the earthquake of 11, though the words were probably not spoken, but written afterward.

Summary. A judgment on Israel: (1) The nation has sinned grievously, treating the poor and needy unjustly, and oppressing them beyond all measure ; until her behavior has become in the eyes of the world a profanation of Yahweh’s holy name. (2) This moral condition is due to no lack of effort on Yahweh’s part; since he had led Israel out of Egypt into Canaan, had driven out the Canaanites before her, and had given teachers who should declare righteousness to her; but all his care had been without result. (3) For her sins Israel must suffer, the nation shall perish ; none, not even the swiftest and strongest, shall escape.
§ 5. The roar of the lion; destruction is coming. 3'°. The prophet’s first message concerning Israel’s future has been de- livered. The people, very naturally, refuse to credit his state- ments. Yahweh is not likely, in their opinion, to desert his own nation. Everything, politically considered, seems to be prosperous. Disaster of any kind is far removed from their thoughts. The leaders are blind to the actual situation. To meet this condition of things, the prophet delivers what may be regarded as the most striking of all his utterances, viz. 3**. The ordinary view * which makes this passage an explanation of the prophet’s mission, upon the ground that he was compelled by Yahweh’s power to speak, although against his will, does not bear close examination.
The strophic arrangement of 3 }Sis 2, 4, 4, 4, and 2 lines, each line a pentame- ter, a movement better adapted to the thought than the trimeter. Strophe 2 seems to have lost one of its four lines, the restoration of which (something like, But you have forsaken and rejected Yahweh your God) greatly aids in se- curing an intelligible interpretation. The effort of D, H. Miiller ¢ to connect these vs. (1-8), as two strophes, with a third strophe (vs.*!”), in each of which there is an allusion to the “lion” in the last line but one, seems arbitrary when one measures the last line of the proposed third strophe, and observes that, in order to meet the exigencies of the theory, in other words, to get in “the lion,” he makes it twice the length of any other line, Cf. the arrangement by Lohr which makes vs. 11° consist of three strophes of 10, 6, and 6 lines re- spectively, involves the omission of vs.1>.4>.5> nd 7 and the transposition of 64 to follow ®, and disregards the irregularity of the length of the lines thereby secured. See also Baumann, 35 ff. Marti treats v.3 as a gloss.

1. Strophe 1 (v.1) is made up of two pentameters, and forms the introduc- tion. —’w »33] is really superfluous after o>.y and before ‘nn->3 Sy, and, since it lengthens the line unduly, may well be regarded as a gloss. —132] Some Mss. have m2, so & ofkos, and Syr.-Hex.

Léhr and Marti omit 1° as an interpolation due to a desire to make the following speech refer to Judah as well as to Israel. In favor of this might be urged (see Seesemann, Lohr; cf. Baumann): (1) that the sentence is complete with 1%; (2) 1 drags a little; (3) the change of person, from Yahweh to I, is a little awk- ward; (4) this expresses briefly Amos’s theory of divine justice, but this theory in the vs. that follow is developed and applied only to Israel, not to Judah; (5) Amos never uses Nb to introduce a divine oracle. But this con- clusion is not necessary. Amos develops his thesis only against Ephraim, but it is not impossible that in the theme he has Judah in mind also; by means of an addition to an address to Ephraim he briefly indicates that what he is about to say in y.? applies to Judah as well as Israel. It is not his function, however, to apply it especially to Judah (so Seesemann). Since v.8 is synonymous with y.?>, this interpretation (v.z.) solving what has already become a difficult problem (Oort, 727. XIV., 121 f., 138, failing to find any connection between v.? and v.°, and considering the “ particularism” of v.? inconsistent with the catholic spirit of Amos, regards vs. 2 as an interpola- tion; while Now. treats 38 as having no logical relation to 312), in order to secure a logical antecedent for v.?° and, at the same time, make the structure of strophe 2 complete, I would suggest that such a line as, But you have for- saken Yahweh, your God, once formed a part of the text.—2. pr] @ whi; Z. wdvous.— ony] Gr. ‘27Y}.—-wn 520] & precedes this with the phrase “from all the peoples,” which is probably a marginal note, explaining nnpwn, that has crept into the text (so Seb.).—o>niiy] @ ras duaprlas (some codd. kaxlas); "A. dvoulas; 2D. ddixlas; ©. doeBelas; & Gaaciu; @ poa5n; D iniguitates.—3. 1] @ éri 7d abrd xabddrov. —11y13 ON] GF éav wh yrupl- cwow éavrovs (= 3), so Marti; but’A. cvyrdtwyrar; ©, cvvédOworr.

This phrase “ reminded Israel proper that any preeminence among the nations of which they might boast was the inheritance of all the sons of Jacob, and it reminded Judah that any danger that threatened Israel threatened them also, so far as they had been guilty of similar transgressions.” + The word uttered is against] not simply in reference zo the nation Israel; and here, as fre- quently among the prophets, there is the fond allusion to the time when Yahweh brought her up out of the land of Egypt] 1.¢. the time when Israel really became a nation. So intense has the thought of the prophet become that he identifies himself with Yahweh. —2. You only have I known | Not, acknowledge { as of the elect, nor take notice of = love § (cf. Ho. 13° Ps. 1° Jb. 24”) ; with the following preposition from, the idea is 40 distinguish from, to choose, as in Gn. 18" Je. 1° Is. 58°. This thought is found also in Dt. 7°14? 284%" Ps, 147%. The doctrine that Israel has been chosen by Yahweh for a particular service to the world lies at the basis of every expression of Hebrew thought. Nor is it paralleled by a similar doctrine among other nations ; in any case, the teaching took a stronger hold of Israel. This thought, car- ried too far, furnished the basis for a superstition almost as deadly as any of those which the Israelitish religion was to displace. Against this superstition the prophets contend. The choice of Israel by Yahweh, they maintain, is not unconditional. Israel must cherish the right mind toward Yahweh, or punishment will come ; and when it comes, it will be all the more severe because of the special privileges which she has enjoyed. Was this idea true? or was it a fancy of the Hebrew people? To answer this question is to place an estimate upon the whole prophetic work. The thought of v2 suggests the idea of failure on the part of Israel to fulfil the divine purpose (cf. Ho. 4” Je. 5 Dt. 31° 1 S. igh 2k 19") because she has rejected Yahweh ; and now J wi// visit upon you all your iniguities| (cf. Ex. 20° Je. 5° * 11” 23%, etc.), because, Israel,

III. 1-3 67
you have rejected the unique privileges offered you; because, although specially chosen, and given a knowledge of Yahweh's will which others did not have, you have shown yourselves un- worthy. Calamity is here, as everywhere, pictured as a visitation of God. Too much stress must not be placed upon @//, which does not imply that, while all of Israel’s sins shall be punished, some of those of less favored nations might be overlooked.* _Israel’s punishment, declares the prophet, will be the more severe because her sins have been more heinous; the “all” refers to the sins of the nation many times repeated. If, now, Yahweh and Israel have no longer anything in common, can there be harmony and cooperation as in the past? —3. Can (they) two walk together, if they be not agreed? | If, on the one hand, Israel has left Yahweh, and if, on the other, he is planning for Israel terrible punishment, what will be the issue? The prophet sees, what other men of his times do not see, viz. the dissolution of the covenant relationship which has hitherto existed between Israel and Yahweh. In the remaining strophes he proceeds to develop this thought. The interpretations which connect v.? with what follows, and make it to be the thought of the whole, that everything has a definite cause and works out an ordained result (¢.g. that two persons, seen walking together in the wild mcorlands of Tekoa, must have arranged their meeting beforehand, z.¢. have agreed to be to- gether, cf. Jos. 11° Jb. 2”),f and that the presence of the prophet against his will indicates a plan of action formed against them by Yahweh himself, { proceed from a wrong point of view. No- tice should be taken of that other class of interpretations in which a special allusion is found in sy) to the agreement be- tween Yahweh and the prophet, conveying authority to the latter, § or the agreement between Joel and Amos,|| or the agreement among all the prophets, an agreement which indicated the truth of their message as coming from the Holy Spirit, this assertion of their authority being rendered necessary because the proph- ets had been forbidden (2) to prophesy.** That the verse

In a double figure, that of a lion and his prey, and that of a bird and its hunter, the situation of Israel, in the prophet’s times, is portrayed. This situation is the result of the separation of Israel from Yahweh. The difficulty lies in the fact that Israel as a nation has long been deaf to the roaring of the lion, and blind to the hunter and his snare. Only the prophet hears and sees.
The structure of strophe 3 is clear.

4. The prophet is a countryman and deals with phenomena which are familiar to him. For a long time lions have not fre- quented Palestine, but the testimony is unquestioned that they were common down to the Christian era, and even later.* — Does a lon roar in the forest when there 1s no prey for him] 1.e. Does he go hunting without securing something? or in declarative form, When a lion roars, his prey is near at hand; let it beware. The second member is only a variation in form of the first: The young lion does not utter his voice unless he has caught something. In the prophet’s mind the people, destined to suffer for their sins, are the prey, which is already, in vision, in the possession of the lion, whose roar, though uttered, the prey has not understood. The prophet’s voice is one of warning ; and, now, with change of figure we hear it again ; and this time, likewise, it is a figure which appeals to a countryman. — 5. Does a bird fall upon the ground, if there is no hunter? or does a snare fly up without catching anything ?| Here, as Mitchell observes, “ the order of thought is reversed.”” The prophet, with his keen insight, perceives that already the bird has fallen, the snare has sprung up. It follows, therefore, that there is a hunter near at hand, invisible perhaps, but none the less real. Cannot the people see that they are entrapped, that they are already within the toils ?
The first couplet (v.4) has been interpreted (1) as one of several illustra- tions of the principle of cause and effect; nothing happens by chance; there is always a cause (Reu., Val., Now., GAS., Dr., e¢ a/.); (2) as describing Yahweh under the figure of a lion (cf. v.®, also 12, Je. 2589 Ho. 1119; and, on the roaring of the lion, cf. Ps. 104?! Is. 5% 314 Je. 215 Ez, 22%), i.e. Yahweh’s roar compels me to prophesy (Schré., Hi.), or Yahweh’s roar indi-

cates imminent danger (Cal., Os., Pu.), or Yahweh’s roar should lead to repentance (Geb.), or Yahweh does not threaten, and fail to send punish- ment (Dathe, Jus., Ros.). It is suggested by some (Ba., Hi.) that in the first clause the roaring precedes and is the cause of capture; while in the second, it is a different roar, viz. that which accompanies the eating and so follows as the result of the capture. According to Geb. the young lion is the prophet who joins with Yahweh in threatening punishment; Hd. suggests that the subject of 129 must be 7:78, not 192, since the young lion in the den roars only when the old lion brings home the prey; but the second clause is generally understood to present the same thought as the first (Ros., Ke., et al.). Even greater difficulty has attended the interpretation of the second couplet : (1) a bird does not fall upon the ground, unless there be to it, z.¢. the bird (Hi. Mau., Ba.), or the ground (Hes.), a snare (Cal., Os., Dat., Ros.), or a fowler (Luther, Ba.); in other words, people do not suffer except because of sin; or calamity never comes except by a net which God stretches (Cal., Os., Dat.), or calamity comes through the snare of Jeroboam’s false worship (Geb.). The ng of v.5? is “ the large net of the bird-catcher which he has to draw up and which takes a number of birds at once” (Ew.). Hence, will the net go up, i.e. be taken away (Ew., Hes., Mau.), or treating Ady. as Hiph., will the fowler remove the net before, etc. (Cal., Geb., Jus., Schré. ; cf. 8); while many understand it as meaning, the net does not spring up unless a bird has entered it (Os., Hi., Hd., Ke., Now., GAS., Dr., e¢ a/.). From one or another of these renderings, the thought is inferred to be: Yahweh will surely not desist until his threatenings have been fulfilled (Cal., Os., Ros., et al.), or Israel is to be captured by the fowler Satan (Geb.). You cannot escape a punishment which God has announced through the prophets (Dat.). Just as none of these things happen without a cause, so the prophet’s preach- ing is not without cause — Yahweh has revealed to him the coming calamity (so GAS., Now., Dr., Marti, e¢ a/.).

6,7. Zhe calamity comes from Yahweh; but Yahweh always warns; why, then, do not the people tremble ?
Having announced that Yahweh and Israel must now separate and that the latter is to be punished (strophe 2), that a nation, even at this time, is ready to pounce down upon Israel as her prey (strophe 3), the prophet, in strophe 4, asks: Why, when the alarm has been given, do the people not tremble? This calamity, so soon to burst upon them, like every such calamity, is from Yahweh. Do they not understand that Yahweh sends no disaster without having previously made announcement through his prophets ?
6. The structure of strophe 4 is chiastic, members 1 and 4 relating to the alarm, members 2 and 3, to the agency of Yahweh. Nothing can be more certain than the close relationship of these two couplets. The versions almost unanimously treat 0x as a particle of condition. —-yy3 Ayn] Hoffm., aya ayy (v.2.).—awy] Elh. 737.

They are given the knowledge and are expected to sound the alarm by forewarning and exhortation. Since, then, every calamity comes from Yahweh to serve a purpose, and since the prophets, who are the interpreters of the divine will, have given the alarm, how strange that the people who are in such danger do not hear and tremble !

8. The enemy having manifested his presence, let every one fear ; Yahweh having spoken, let every one recognize the coming calamity.
The utterance is the last of the rapidly rising climax, and sus- tains a close logical connection with what has been said; both members are thus connected with strophe 2, the first, also, espe- cially with strophe 3, and the second with strophe 4 __In view of the decision to punish Israel for his sins (strophe 2), a movement has been inaugurated which makes Israel, though seemingly un- conscious of the fact, the prey of a mighty nation (strophe 3); the lion has roared, let every one fear (strophe 5 2); Yahweh is the author of this situation, and has through his prophets an- nounced it, though without effect (strophe 4); the Lord God hath spoken, let every one hear and see beforehand the coming disaster (strophe 5 4).

§ 6. The doom of Samaria. 3°-4°. In still another form the prophet delivers the message given him to proclaim. (1) So great is the wickedness of the capital city, Samaria, that even Egypt and Philistia, called upon to look within Samaria’s walls, are astonished at what they see. (2) But an enemy is coming who will quickly lay waste this beautiful and luxurious city. What remains will be as nothing. Even the altars of Bethel will be in- cluded in the dreadful destruction. (3) The women of Samaria, because of their debaucheries, must share the punishment. They shall be carried away captives through breaches in the wall.
This piece, which is entirely separate from the preceding and following, originally consisted of six strophes, each containing four pentameters. To restore this, certain minor changes in the text are necessary as well as the transfer of v.15 to follow v.12 (see BW., Sept. 1898, pp. 179-82; so

also Elh.; cf. Léhr who places v.!2 after vs,3.¥4 sndi5; and Baumann who places v.!> between y.0 and v1). Here again Miiller’s arrangement of strophes (Die Propheten, I. 71) fails, because he has not observed that 4° belongs with 315 and, indeed, forms the climax of the piece (so We., GAS.) The first line of each strophe, as rearranged, contains a statement of proclamation or assertion on the part of Yahweh, thus giving great intensity to the whole passage. Still further, the six strophes logically divide them- selves into three groups, each of two, and in the first strophe of each group reference is made to Samaria. Strophes 1 and 2 (vs.9 10, ys,ll. 15) present a judgment scene. Samaria is accused of tumult and oppression. Outside nations are summoned to witness her wickedness and to testify against her, The decision is rendered — punishment, viz. destruction by a foreign foe who will lay waste the whole city. Three clauses are probably interpola- tions: (1) mp8) (v.29) merely repeats the idea contained in yonwa and, although in the form +pxb it would be common, may be thrown out; (2) M2772 OpWy) (v.°) is very awkward, meaning, not oppression, but the op- pressed; does not join well with mpi; is superfluous in view of 7 (v.22) ; and entirely spoils the measure of the line (see BW, Sept. 1898, p. 182; so Lohr). (3) m7 Dx) (v.15) does violence to the measure and is tautological after the same phrase in v.U, which constitutes the first member of the strophe. The transfer of v.!° to follow v.1! is justified by the demands of the strophic arrangement, for otherwise all would be confusion; by the closeness of thought in vs.14xd15, everything having to do with houses (palaces, winter houses, summer houses) ; and by the fact that in its present position it makes an anti-climax, while by its removal v.14 furnishes, in the destruction even of Bethel’s altars, the highest point yet reached in the description.

Ex. 22") was accustomed to produce the remains of a beast as evidence. Amos’s references to lions are not infrequent ; cf. 38 5! The force of the comparison lies in the insignificant character of what is rescued, viz. two legs or a piece of an ear), the merest remnant, something, indeed, not worthy of mention. Some { think of an allusion to a variety of goat with exceedingly large ears, which would be of sufficient value to account for the shepherd’s rescuing them at such danger to himself; but this is unnecessary. — So the children of Israel shall be rescued | There is to be added, perhaps, from the enemy (v.s.) ; cf. the rendering rescue themselves ;§ in other words, practically none of the Is- raelitish voluptuaries described shall be saved, there being no possible reference to the remnant referred to in 9°, an idea so cherished by Isaiah (6"). || — Zhey who sit in Samaria on the corner of a couch, on the damask of a divan] One may put aside without much consideration most of the interpretations proposed for this passage, ¢.g.

IV. 1-3. Zhe women of Samaria who by their debaucheries have oppressed the poor will be carried away captive through breaches in the walls of the city. The fifth and sixth strophes close the piece and present in form and thought an almost perfect climax.
At first sight the pentameter seems to have been abandoned; but a study of the double strophe, as a whole, shows a purpose in this on the part of the artist. One serious difficulty remains, however, upon any hypothesis of construction, viz. the evident shortness of strophe 5, line 2, ape 32 Wr (41). It is probable that a word like )2¥. has dropped out after We. The tetram- eter of lines 3 and 4 is explained by the evident desire for double phrases ending in n\ and ov-, by the length and full sound of two of these phrases thus brought into juxtaposition, and by the preparation of the poet for the climactic effort which is to be made in strophe 6. This last point will perhaps also explain the shortness of strophe 6. Having now used every art at his disposal with which to prepare for the final scathing words of taunt and rebuke, line 3 is drawn out with words long and strong sounding, while line 4 is still longer and stronger, a fitting expression of the terrible thought which has been accumulating. Isaiah, in later times, adopted not only the idea of reaching a climax, in the description of a coming calamity, by charging the women with responsibility because of their debaucheries, but also the use of words ending in mn) and o

for the effect of the sound. Cf. Is. 3188, in which this method is developed at great length and most skilfully.

1. Ye kine of Bashan] The attention of the prophets is not infrequently turned to women (cf. Is. 3% 4"). The women of the times are here designated by a figure strikingly appropriate. Bashan * was the northernmost of the three great divisions of the mountainous range east of the Jordan, reaching to the Yarmuk, south of which were Mt. Gilead and Ha-Mishér, and was known for its oaks (Is. 2% Ez. 27° Zc. 117), its pastures (Mi. 7% Na. 1* Je. 50"), and especially its cattle (Dt. 32 Ps. 22” Ez. 39"), which are represented as being both fat and ferocious. The allusion is not to the men,f especially judges and counsellors, called cows by way of contempt, which supposition would explain the masculine form of www ; but, in view of a8, Je. 50% Ps. 22”, where men are intended, and the feminine forms occurring so frequently in the passage, to the noble women and princesses ¢ who are now rebuked because of their sins. — Who .. . in the mountain of Samaria| Cf. above and on 3°.— Injure the poor and crush the needy] Not directly, to be sure, but through ¢heir husbands] (cf. 2’ 8°), not the rich, § of whom the rulers ask bribes, for oppressing the poor; nor the kings and princes || urged to intemperance by their counsellors ; nor the king, the plural being a plural of excellence (cf.

Je. 31” Ps. 109% Dn. rr‘) is clear from 7”, in which he looks forward to an immediate destruction. In the synonymous member, for the sake of emphasis, he adds that even of those, if there are any, who may be left, the last without excep- tion shall suffer in like manner, viz. be carried away with jish- hooks| thus interpreting the expression already given.ff The older interpretation fos was strange enough in connection with the word 775, fish. Calvin’s idea, that though they thought them- selves so large they should be carried away by a very small instru- ment (fish-hooks), and Gebhard’s, that the instruments were poles sharp like thorns, which were to be used for rescuing the women from fish-ponds into which they had fallen, are equally absurd ; cf. the view of G. A. Smith that, the hooks ordinarily used for such purposes having all been used on account of the great number of captives, fish-hooks will be used for the last of them. The correct idea is the same as in Hb. 17*?, z.e. that of women as helpless as the fishin the hands of the angler (Mitchell) ; cf. also the usage of the Assyrians in leading captives by ropes fastened to rings in the under lip. tt —38.

§ 7. Israel’s failure to understand the divine judgments. 4*% The occasion is perhaps a festival.* The prophet in an ironical vein exhorts Israel to continue in the formal ceremonial worship —the cultus at Bethel and Gilgal — but it is all an illusion, and displeasing to the very God whose favor they thus seek to gain. Again and again Yahweh has indicated his displeasure with their conduct in drought, in famine, in blight of crops, in pestilence and war, and in earthquake ; but alas! they have not turned back. It remains, therefore, to inflict upon them,—what? In any event, “Prepare, O Israel, to meet thy God!” Who is he that speaks thus? The God of creation and history.
This piece, though very different in movement and structure from any that has preceded, is none the lessartistic. The arrangement presented here appeared in BW., October, 1898, pp. 251 f. In its original form the piece consisted of nine strophes, each containing four trimeters. Of these, 1 and 2, which form the introduction, are closely connected, likewise 8 and 9, which form the con- clusion. Strophes 3-7, each of which is introduced by a vb. in the first per- son (7° and 8@ are a gloss), and characterized by the refrain But you did not return to me, saith Yahweh, make the body of the poem (cf. below on strophes 4,5). Miiller’s arrangement (Die Propheten, I. 68 f.) of this section, in- cluding 4!3, is arbitrary and artificial. His attempt to secure strophes of 5+44+34+2+1, and refrain, z.e. 16 lines, with an introduction of 8 lines and a closing strophe of 8 lines, is an utter failure. One need only examine the lines to see that they have been arranged to meet the demands of the theory. It is important to note the more serious changes of text involved in the reconstruction here adopted. These will be discussed in detail in their proper places: —
(1) the rejection in v.72 of the gloss own nwhw sya; (2) the rejection of v.7® and all of v.8, except the refrain, as a gloss; (3) the rejection of the gloss n»»D1D 1a dy; (4) the treatment of v.¥ as a later addition, although, if the line ww nyx2y nbs mm might be fitted into strophe 8, the place of a lost line would be supplied in that strophe and an extra line avoided in strophe 9.
The arrangement proposed by Léhr (in 1901) has much in common with the present reconstruction, viz. (1) the rejection of vs.’-8 as a later addition (so also Baumann) ; 7a 8b, however, are regarded here as genuine; (2) the treatment of vs.l2°- 18 as an interpolation; (3) Léhr finds in vs.+6 and *1 six strophes identical with strophes 1-3 and 5-7 of the present arrangement (ex- cept that he makes two lines out of the refrain instead of one, as here, and retains D>D1D ‘aw oy). But Ldhr differs also in connecting 3'° 9) (as far

4, 5. Continue, O Israel, your efforts by Sacrifices to secure Yahweh's favor, — but it ts useless.
The strophe consists of three couplets, each containing an ironical command relating to the cultus, with a fourth couplet explaining Israel’s strange conduct, viz. their love for all this empty show. The structure is perfect, every line being regular in length.

4. Go to Bethel and—transgress.] It is only necessary to read the whole phrase to see that the prophet is not serious; “ going to Bethel” carries with it transgression, the two are synonymous. The tone of voice, doubtless, indicated the irony of the expression. The transgression was not (1) the worshipping on high places, a violation of the law of the central sanctuary at Jerusalem (Dt. 12*”),* for that law had not yet been promulgated; nor (2) the changing of the details of the ceremonial by adapting them to the heathen worship outside of Israel; nor (3) the calf- worship which was in vogue at Bethel (cf. Ho. 4% 8°*) ;+ nor (4) the failure to give Yahweh a proper place in the worship ; § nor (5) the fact of engaging in worship though morally unfit, || — but the fact of engaging in any kind of ceremonial worship for the purpose of finding Yahweh, when, indeed, the more zealously they observe the cultus, the farther do they remove themselves from Yahweh.{{ — Zn Gilga/] For situation and description,** cf.

In strict parallelism with the preceding line, the prophet urges the wor- shippers to offer their tithes every third day instead of every third year.** Note, however, should be made of the renderings, every three years, Dv = year tf (as in Lv. 25% Ju. 17° 2 Ch. 21), on three days (= at the times of the three great feasts, which, it is claimed, lasted originally each a single day), tt every three days, 1.e. frequently, §§ and especially, on the third day (after arrival), |||| on the ground that Amos is exaggerating nothing, but as above, describ- ing the custom of the visiting worshipper at Bethel, who offered his sacrifice on the morning after arrival and his tithe on the third day, a supposition for which no one offers a good reason. __5.

(é.¢. turning into sweet smoke) what ordinarily was not burned, viz. the leavened bread which formed a part of the thank-offer- ing. Amos does not here refer to the transgression of any law in existence (eg. Lv. 2" 7”); but to a new custom, just now being developed, the thought being that a thank-offering prepared with yeast or grape-honey (Ho. 3') would be more acceptable. This use of leaven (cf. the raisin-cakes of Ho. 3!) was probably regarded as pleasing to the Canaanitish deities,* hence in later times it came to be forbidden (Lv. 7” Ex. 23"). The transla- tion of ©, from violence = that which is gained by violence (v.s.) seems to relieve a serious difficulty, but like the rendering without leavent is quite far-fetched ; cf. @ (v.s.).— And proclaim free- will offerings, make them known] The freewill-offering (cf. the later regulations Dt. 12°” Ex. 35” Lv. 221°) was intended to be given as the freest possible expression of the heart’s feeling. The irony, which still continues, lies in the prophet’s urging the people, not the priests, { to publish far and wide§ their voluntary gifts, an action which was directly contrary to the spirit of such gifts. The language does not convey the idea, ordinarily assigned to it, of a command to the priests to make freewill offerings compulsory. || — or so ye love to do] Cf. Je. 5". The prophet has described a tendency, indeed the fundamental error, of the Northern religion. This fault, which has now become an organic part of the national system, is not that the offerings, correct in themselves, were made at the wrong place,f but that Israel is laboring under a delusive idea; for outward forms of any kind, however zealously executed, will not take the place of the essentials of religion.

It cannot be said that the Pi‘él is the proper word to be used for burning incense, and the Hiph. of sacrifices (Gun.). The Massorites attempted to make the distinction that the Pi'él designates either irregular or jdolatrous sacrifice, the Hiph., lawful. But this is arbitrary (cf. 2 Ch. 3475). Rather, the Pi‘él is the older expression, and the Hiph. the younger, used chiefly in P; cf. Ké. 96 (We. Prol. 64; ZAW. VI. 298f.; Kit. Theol. Studien aus Witrtemberg, Il. 53; SS. 660; Now. Arch.

In general, all leavened bread was forbidden to be offered on the altar (Ex. 23)8 Ly. 211). Traces of greater freedom appear in Lv. 78 2317, This passage shows the custom in Israel to have been different from that in Judah. Amos does not necessarily regard it as unlawful (We.). Indeed, the custom may be regarded as in har- mony with the original ideas of sacrifice (WRS. Sem. 220f., 242; OTC. 345). —nnn] The thank-offering is a particular kind of the onby (Lv. 72).

On tithes in general, see Spencer, De Legibus Hebraecorum, III. 10, § 1; Ew. Antiguities, p. 300; Ryssel, s.v. “Zehnten,” PRE2; WRS. Sem., Lecture VIL., and Proph. 383 f., and art. “Tithes,” Enc. Br.; We. Erol. 1 56f.; Dr. Dt. 166-73; Now. Arch. Il. 257 f. Among non-Semites may be cited the Greeks, who tithed the spoils of war, the annual crops, and other sources of revenue (Xenophon and his followers, eg., reserved a tithe of the proceeds of the sale of captives for a thank-offering to the gods, Xenophon himself using his own share to erect a small temple in Scillus, near Olympia; v. Anadasis, V. 3; cf. Her- mann, Gottesdienstl. Alterth. d. Griechen (2d ed.), § 20, 4); the Romans, who paid tithes to Hercules (Diodorus, IV. 21; Plutarch, Moralia, II. 267 E), and the Lydians, who tithed their cattle (Nic. Damasc. in Miiller’s Fragm. Hist. Gr. III. 371). Among the Semites the custom was general; the Car- thaginians sent an annual tithe of their increase to Tyre to the temple of Mel- karth (Diodorus, XX. 14); there are many references to tithes and monthly tributes in the records of the Babylonian temples (Jastrow, Rel. 668). A common vow among the Arabs was, “If God gives me a hundred sheep, I will sacrifice one in every ten” (Arnold, Septem Mo'allakét, p. 186). The only pre-Deuteronomic references to the tithe in the O. T. are Gn. 2822 and this passage. It is to be noted that both connect the payment of tithes with Bethel. It is probable that in early times the religious tithe of each district was given for the support of the sanctuary of the district. This tithe was probably not compulsory, but was spontaneously given; it is classed by Amos with freewill-offerings, thank-offerings, and vows, and may have been used to furnish a sacrificial banquet. The absence of any regulation concerning tithes in the earliest legislation seems to point to the voluntary character of the gift, It is not unlikely that in the earliest times the tithe and the “ firstfruits ” and “firstborn” were identical.

Gn. 12” 261 41 Ru. 11 2S. 2111 K. 17.* The meaning s/wpidity, favored by some of the versions (v.s.), does not accord with the etymology of the word, the parallelism, or the context. The idea of “ innocency of eating what was forbidden,” or that of “emptiness,”{ is not to be found in the word. — /n all your cities| The calamity referred to affected the whole country.

The interpolator may have had in mind either (1) the so-called latter rains of the last of February or first of March, the harvest beginning, in some sections of the country, April 1 and con- tinuing into June; this rain fell when the grain was beginning to grow, and without it the crops would be ruined (but see Nowack, 135);§ or (2) a drought for the entire three months preceding harvest ; || or (3) the rain which fell in the latter part of April, that is, three months before the fruit harvest,§ or within three months of the last of the grain harvest in June ;** or (4) the heavy rain due six months before harvest, z.e. in November and December, which in this case Yahweh had withheld until three months before the harvest time, that is, until sometime in January.tf — Rain upon one city| Not at intervals, upon various occasions, {

How remarkably this picture resembles that given in 6° ”, which must also be treated as an interpolation !* — But ye did not return unto me| The refrain, which contains, as Mitchell has said, “a world of pathetic tenderness.”

In Ex. 22°, the verb is used as here of animals, though elsewhere of men. The preposition oy here = desédes and is used in a late or Arabic sense. The peculiar usage of the more important words, the anti-climax, the fact that the line interferes with the stro- phe, and the evident afterthought implied in it show its character as a later insertion. — And J caused the stench of your camps to rise in your nostrils| The slaughter was so great, the unburied bodies and carcasses so many (cf. Is. 34°), that pestilence arose, the result of war. As above, drought followed famine, though the occasion of it, so here war follows pestilence, though the occasion of it.

Gn. 19” Dt. 29” Is. 17 || 13” Je. 49% 50%. The shortness of this line may be due to the omission of some phrase.{ — As God overthrew Sodom and Go- morrah| The point of comparison is not the manner of the over- throw, but its thoroughness.** The form of expression is so similar to that in Gn. 19 as to lead some tf to suppose that Amos had that text before him. The use of the word //ohim, in con- trast with the subject of *n>5n, strangely enough has been thought to prove the existence of more than one person in the Godhead. {tf The reading “the great overthrow,” using “/ohim as a superla- tive, §§ is grammatically possible, but out of harmony with the con- text.— And ye were asa brand snatched from the blaze| t.e. ye were’ barely rescued, saved as by a miracle, cf.

The remaining strophes of the poem have suffered greatly in their text. It may be accepted, in general, that a part of v.!? and all of v.18 are from the hand of a later writer (so Duhm, Zheol. 109; Oort, 747. XIV. 117/53 We., Sta. GVZ. I. 571; Taylor, DB.; Lohr, Che. in WRS. Propfh. XV. and ZB. I, 153; Bu. Jew. Enc.; Now., Co. Lind. 176; Baud. Eznd. 509; Marti; but on the contrary see WRS. Proph. 400; Kue. Zznd. Il. 3473 Mit., Hoffm. ZA W. III. 103; cf. GAS. I. 201 ff.; Dr. 118 f.). It may be supposed that the original poem contained a conclusion, predicting a punish- ment more severe than any of those which had been described; that this prediction was in form consistent with the strophes which preceded, though, of course, without the refrain; that the later editor, for one or more of several reasons which might be given, substituted the present concluding lines, which are general in character, for the more specific statement in the original; that this later editor, here as everywhere, ignored, consciously or unconsciously, the poetic form of the production which he thus modified. It is not strange (contra We.) that the conclusion here, as perhaps in Is. 9, should thus be broken off. We may well understand that in a multitude of cases the closing words of earlier sermons, having lost in later times the direct and specific reference which they were intended to convey, have given place to utter- ances presenting more modern thought and form. In view of this we need not be surprised to find that while vs.!2 13 as thus modified contain eight lines (the number for two strophes), they are so constructed that, except by a transposition which is more or less violent, the division is 3 + 5 instead of 4+4.

The original poem consisted of six strophes (vs.1®). The second and third strophes are elegiac in their movement, a short line (dimeter) follow- ing a longer line (trimeter). Bu., ZA W,. Il. 30, considers only the second strophe to be elegiac; so Mit.,125; Dr. 175. The 2p (dirge) was a formal composition, somewhat artistically constructed, the second or shorter line being intended to echo the first, “ producing a plaintive, melancholy cadence.” To the six original strophes were added, by a later hand, two strophes, each having four trimeters. V.7 belongs to the section which follows, and should precede v.19, The addition is after the analogy of the insertion already noticed in 413, There is, notwithstanding the statements of Oort (w.2.) and Volz, entirely satisfactory connection between vs.** and ys.!-,

1. Hear this word.| The beginning of a new discourse, intended, if possible, to strike terror to the hearts of the people and thus lead them to repentance. Such a message, uttered in the pros- perous days of Jeroboam II., would certainly seem to be in con- trast with the time in which it was uttered.— Which I take up against you, even a dirge| This rendering is to be preferred to (1) as I uplift a dirge, making WX = as ;* or (2) because [ uplift, etc.,¢ since it is the more simple and at the same time accords better with the versification. The word “take up” (NW?) ze. on the lips, is found in the technical term sw, so often used by the prophets; it means “to pronounce,” “to denounce,” and is used regularly of a dirge (Je. 7” Ez. 19', etc.). Just as in the case of an individual’s death there was uttered a lamentation (cf. 2S. U7 Ez. 28% 32? 2 Ch. 35”) so here, the death of the nation being assumed, the mourner utters the dirge-song.

The expression is used of violent death (2.2. 2 S. 1-7"), especially of death in battle, and of loss of honor or possessions (¢g. 2 S. 1 Ps. 10 Pr. 11%). For its use of nations cf.

Zhe city that goeth forth a thousand having (6ut) a hundred left| ‘The two circumstantial clauses of this verse add to the picture portrayed in v2 an additional feature, viz. the ninefold decimation of the forces sent out to war, a terrible slaughter. The statement is general, the city being any city in the kingdom. The thousand refers not simply to the levy or census,* but to the warriors who marched out for war.t While it is evident that in Amos’s time the basis of military enrolment was the towns and villages, in earlier days it was tribes and families.{ For allusions to similar companies, cf. 1S. 82 2S, 18h4 2 K. r1*™ Ex. 18” etc.§ — Of the house of Israel] Transferred (v.s.).

XXII. 201-7).— yp] The verb 73) is doubtless a denominative from nyp. A plausible derivation ( 7hes.), for
ap is the Arabic root ok, to forge, devise, hence a skilfully wrought production, so named either from its poetic form, or from its contents as glorifying the dead (Wetzstein, Zeitsch. f. Ethnologie, 1873, pp. 27° ff.). Bu. prefers the former reason (ZA W. I. 28). This derivation from the Arabic is doubted by some (eg. Ba.). The closest parallel is found in the Syriac ldao, which means both song and elegy. We may also compare Eth. 3: song, and P5F = to sing. The ap is an elegy, a poem of lamenta- tion, thus distinguished from ‘71, which means sometimes a song of lament, but sometimes simply the cry of mourning (Je. 3125); cf. the vb. in 1S. 7, np is used commonly, as here, with xvi (Je. 72° 99 Ez. 19! 2617 272 3e 2812 322); with inp (2 S. 117 Ez. 32!6), and with 19. With svn, by gen- erally precedes the person or thing which is the object of lamentation, but sometimes 5x (Ez. 19! 2732); Sy is sometimes used of the place (Je.

4-6. Israel shall fall (vs.'*) because she has disobeyed the divine command given in the past to seek Vahweh alone. [ But even now the entreaty comes again] Seek Yahweh, lest ye perish.
These verses contain the second half of the dirge (strophes 4, 5) and the concluding strophe of the original poem, somewhat mutilated. The second half gives the explanation of the destruction announced in the first half; while in the concluding strophe, the prophet, as so many times before, turns in exhortation to the people to do the thing, the neglect of doing which in the past has cost them so dearly. The logical connection of vs.‘6 becomes plain when 4px (v.*) is taken as historical pf., or plup. (v.z.); and, therefore, the proposal to throw out vs.!-3 (Oort), or to treat v.4 as introducing a new section (Now., Marti), may be rejected.

4. For thus said Yahweh to the house of Israel] The prophet has just described the coming desolation. This description sug- gests at once the question, Are we not zealously engaged in the worship of Yahweh? Why are we then to suffer? The answer is furnished: ‘ Yahweh in times past spoke thus and thus, —com- mands which ye have disobeyed.’ The verb is not to be rendered saith, but said, referring to the injunctions of the past. The dirge may well describe the occasion of the impending calamity. The ordinary interpretation which makes this an exhortation uttered by the prophet, after announcing the calamity,* takes away the force of the most impressive portion of the piece, and compels the prophet to give two exhortations in practically the same lan- guage (see v.°). — Seek me] A common phrase for the expression of religious desire implying worship and obedience, and used alike of God and idols.t — And Jive] 2.e. that you may live, implying that the danger ahead may not be averted otherwise ; cf. Is, 1 Am. 5. The life of course includes national life and prosperity (Baur).

thus rendered more certain, or as an action with a purpose, seek me in order that you may live, the request being thus emphasized, cf. Gn. 42" 1 K. 22” 2 K. 5% Je. 27" Am. 5". There is no reference to the future life, nor, perhaps, even to spiritual life.* —5. And to Beer-sheba do not (ye shall not) cross over] (v.s.). This line, probably corrupt, must be transferred to precede the line and do not seek Beth-el, which is required by the chiastic arrangement of the next strophe. Several explanations have been given of the lack of a corresponding line, as in the case of Gilgal and Beth-el, ¢.g. a pun is evident in the very word paw "x3 = “sw “x3 = fount of captivity ;f or, Beer-sheba is omitted because, being in Judah, it was not destroyed when Samaria fell; +t or because Amos is prophesying only to the ten tribes ;§ or because no suitable paro- nomasia could be found for Beer-sheba.|| If the present text is accepted, we must understand that the Israelites of Amos’s day were not satisfied with visiting the sanctuaries of the North, but were so zealous in their worship as to cross over the border-land of their own territory § and penetrate as far south as the ancient sanctuary of Beer-sheba, thirty miles southwest of Hebron on the road to Egypt. Beer-sheba played an important part in the sto- ries of the patriarchs, cf. Gn. 211! 267-8 28” 461; there is no authority for Driver’s statement, “in Amos’s time it was a popular resort for pilgrims from N. Israel,” unless it is found in 8¥ (a doubtful text). After the captivity it was again occupied (Ne. 11”). This worship was strikingly inconsistent with the assumption of Jeroboam I. that Jerusalem was too far away from the Northern tribes to be the place of central worship. The most extreme form of corrupt worship, viz. that at Beer-sheba, is thus placed in contrast with the true attitude commended. — Ye shall not seek Beth-el| 1.e. visit for the purpose of exercising rites and ceremo- nies. — And Gilgal ye shall not enter| Reference has already been made to these places as the seats of sanctuaries. — For Gileal shall surely go into exile| The Gilgal, in which they now take such de- light, will be laid waste.** — And Beth-el shall become (Beth) aven]

Cf. Hoffmann’s suggestion ** that the wor- ship of the Northern kingdom had many Egyptian elements, such as the calf, that Yahweh was identified with Ra‘, and Beth-el with On, the sacred city. Hence the use of fx by Hosea and Amos has a double sense; here “ your On-Beth-el will become Aven, delu- sion.” It is of importance to note that not far from Beth-el, close to the edge of the desert, there was a village (the site of which is now uncertain) named Beth-aven (cf. Jos. 77 18" 1S. 1 24s eat —6. The dirge being now completed, it is the natural thing for the prophet to utter an exhortation. This, found in v.®, completes the piece. But, unfortunately, one line seems to have been lost ; perhaps it read, And now, O house of Israel, seek Yahweh and live] i.e. do as he long ago bade you. — Lest he cast fire on Joseph's house|t{ The wrath of God is represented by fire (Dt. 32” Ez. 22”). Joseph, as well as Ephraim, is often used for Northern as distinguished from Southern Israel (cf. 2 S. 19” Ob.” Zc. 105 Joseph, without Howse, occurs in Am. 5” 6° Ez. 37% Ps. 78°).— For Beth-el| 6, some Mss., and the demands of the parallelism incline some (v.s.) to read for Israe?; but the reading of HAT is satisfactory, Beth-el being the centre of the religious cultus ; cf. 2 K. 22” Is. 1% Je. 4*.§

For original force of both see BSZ. and BDB. An early meaning, vesor¢ 4o, seems to appear in Am. 5° Dt. 125 2 Ch. 15 Both words were used commonly of consulting the deity, through an oracle or through a prophet, in reference to matters of all kinds, religious and secu- lar (Ex. 1815 1 S. 99 2 K. 31! 88 Ez. 201-3, etc.). From this usage came the broader meaning of seeking in prayer and worship and, in general, striving to act in accord with the divine will (Dt. 429 Ho. 5° Zp. 23 Ps. 40!7 697 1053, etc.). In prophetic speech wn is much the more common word of the two when used of religious affairs. —5. wasn 5x] Deprecation, H. 41, 1 4; Dr. § 50 (a) Obs.; GK. 152 f; K6. 352g., but cf. xb (with wan) prohibition. — babam Syma] marks the chiasm; perhaps xb after Saban is due to a desire not to repeat the sound a/,—nba aba] H. 28, 3a; GK. 113”; Ké. 3297”. —aban »9] Note masc. form of the vb., though the feminine is more usual with names of towns; K6, 248c.

8. Whose name is Yahweh] The God who is Israel’s national God, and who desires Israel’s strongest allegiance. — Zhe creator of the Pleiades and Orion| In two or three strokes the poet depicts the omnipotence of the God for whom he pleads. He seizes upon two of the heavenly constellations which are most conspicuous to represent, by synecdoche, the universe that is visible. They are referred to in Jb. 9°? 38°* (cf. Is. 13°) in the same way as a proof of God’s creative power. The Hebrew name for Orion, which also = foo/, may perhaps contain a trace of some old mythological notion, which held this constellation to have been “ originally some foolhardy, heaven-daring rebel who was chained to the sky for his impiety.” * The thought is not different from that of the Psalmist (8°). This seems to be the meaning rather than (1) the interpretation of m#"D as “genial heat” and SnD as “cold,” t on the ground that it harmonizes better with the context to speak of present acts than of a far-distant creation (but cf. the custom of the Deutero-Isaiah); or (2) that which finds the principal force of the utterance in the star-worship, which was not uncom- mon, in Israel (chs Je.27" 44 ¥c2-K. «19% 21%, cf 23%),) the thought being ‘‘do not worship the stars, but the creator of the stars’’; { or (3) that of mm"D as “ fortune,” “destiny” ;§ or (4) that which supposes the stars to have been mentioned because of their influence upon the weather, and because the writer wished to show the supremacy of Yahweh over all such forces.|| — Who turneth decp gloom into morning| The “darkness” thus turned is not the darkness of death,§ an interpretation based upon an incorrect pointing of maby (v.2.), nor the original creation of light, { but the change from night to day, a most wonderful, although most common, phenomenon.— And day into night darkeneth| This

Ec. 17 Jb. 12); or an inundation, the Noachian deluge, the most terrible punishment in history? § In favor of the last are the use of the expressions ca// and face of the earth, the thought of the following, and the typical character of the illustrations of Yahweh’s power, as thus interpreted, viz., “Jehovah, by whom the world was made, of whose will the order and harmony in nature are an expression, and at whose command the forces in nature may become as destructive as they have been beneficent.’ || —9. Causeth violence to burst upon the strong| For the word x52 (found elsewhere only in Jb. 9% 10” Ps. 39 and mr>sn in Je. 8%) there have been suggested the following: (1) He that strengthens (the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled, or a waster, shall ascend upon the very fortresses ;§ or destruction (= the destroyed) against strength (= the strong) so that (through him) destruction comes upon the fortress) ;* (2) He that mant- Jests ; ** (3) He that causes to flash forth (figure taken from the dawn),tt cf.

The arraignment begun thus with the participle, a favorite form of expression with Amos, in impassioned speech, is continued by the finite verb (cf. 2’ 4%). The figure is drawn from a bitter herb, reckoned poisonous (cf. 6% Je. 9% 23% La. 3% Dt. 29% Pr. 54 Rev. 8") by the ancients. Instead of the sweetness of justice, the bitterness of injustice is accorded. The very institutions which were intended to secure justice produce injustice (cf. La. 3% Am. 6”).— And cast righteousness to the ground | Righteousness, here meaning civil justice, is personified, and represented as an individual thrown down, and treated with violence and contempt, “trampled under foot.” This is stronger than the ordinary “turn aside justice” (Baur); cf. 2 S. 8” Is. 59 Je. 22°,—10.'

Jb. 13” 19° Is. 29”) — perhaps Amos himself. — Zhe one who speaks uprightly| Not one who advocates an unblamable manner of life,* nor one who brings witnesses to prove his own integrity.f The word oan is not an object accusative = one who speaks the truth (cf.

(cf. Ex. 30%) ; his share,* are far-fetched. (Cf. Gratz’s emen- dation; v.s.). The word has come to be a general designation for gift; it was sometimes voluntary (cf. Gn. Pewter togee & Je. 40°), but also sometimes involuntary (cf. 2 Ch. 24°° Ez. 20”). In the latter case, as here, it was really a tax forced from the poor by the rich; { something more than a euphemism for inter-. est, and called such to evade the law§ (Lv. 25” Dt. 23”). Cf. Hitzig’s rendering which introduces the apodosis with this clause : Ye shall have to take from him a present of corn, 1.e. as alms. — Houses of hewn stone] Cf.

12,13,14. Jn view of Israel's many sins of persecution and bribery, prudence would suggest silence, in order that life and Yahweh may still be hers. Vhis double strophe has in the first part, as before, a description of Israel’s wickedness, and in the second part a threat of punishment, viz. the death of the nation and abandonment by Yahweh. The first part has a reference to the “gate” as the forum of justice, and the second is introduced by “ therefore.”
The authenticity of vs.134-and has been questioned by Oort (ZAT. XIV. 122, who suspects only v.!6 and regards 18 and ™ as belonging to Amos, but as originally having followed y.?°), Val., Now., Volz, GAS., Lohr, Che. (#8. I. 154), e¢ al. Oct. grants the late origin of v.13, but claims vs.4f for Amos, placing them, however, after v.24. We. also regards v.13 as interrupting the connection between v.! and v.14, being only a parenthetic note. Eh. inserts v.!* between 511 and 213 f, and vs.13-15 between 216 and 31. Marti places vs.!4f after v.°, and drops v.18 as late. The reasons for suspecting the passage are: (1) lack of relation to v.!2, since a threat (perhaps v.'©) would be naturally expected to follow; (2) lack of con- nection with v.16, the 12> of 8 having no meaning after v.15; (3) lack of unity within these vs. themselves, ©¢ being a repetition of #4, 14 and 16 being an imitation of 546; (4) the use of 5:>wnn in a technical sense as in Pr, 1o!9 Ecclus. 207; (5) the lack of consistency between the thought of v.18 and the general spirit and teaching of Amos, whose tone was bold and fearless, rather than of the kind to encourage silence under difficult circum- stances ; (6) the nation, although treated as responsible, is only a remnant; but there is no time preceding ‘734 B.c, when this historical situation exists. It is to be conceded that the jogical consecution of the passage is not as clear as might be expected from Amos; but it is possible (v.7.) to answer most, if not all, of these objections. If, however, these arguments are conclusive, the
122 AMOS
original piece is one strophe shorter, the second part of strophe 2 and the first part of strophe 3 being late, the original strophe 2 consisting of what is now strophe 2¢ and strophe 3°.

12. Surely I know] A new strophe ; Yahweh is now repre- sented as speaking ; however ignorant men may be, Ae knows (cf. Ps. 73" Jb. 22%).— Many are your transgressions| 7.€. in multi- tudes are they committed. — And great are your sins| The repeti- tion is, of course, poetical, yet the two words mark different kinds of iniquity, the first, deliberate rebellion; the second, habitual variation from the right. The position of the adjective in each is very emphatic. After making the general charges, the speaker introduces more specific arraignment. — Persecutors of the right- eous| Cf. 27 3°; all the more strong because of the singular, and the lack of the article; the impassioned feeling is so marked that the speaker passes in what follows from the second to the third person. — Zakers of bribes | Ordinarily "p> means ransom, the price paid for life by wealthy criminals (Ex. 21 Nu. 35") ; the sin, if this be the meaning, consists in threatening the unprotected with death in order to extort from them a new ransom ;* but here, as in 1 S. 12°, the word means J4ride given to the judgef (cf. smw).— Yea the needy in the gate they thrust aside| Cf. 2" Ex. 23° Dt. 16% 24”. In passing to the third person, there is not simply a “ relaxing of the tension of direct invective” (Mitchell) ; the speaker, as if with gesture of the hand, indicates his con- tempt.{ The offence mentioned was not (1) making the feeble fickle-minded by means of legal decisions,§ nor (2) giving un- just decision against the poor, and thus depriving them of their just rights (cf. Is. 10? 29” Mal. 3° Pr. 18”), || but (3) the repell- ing of those who wished to defend their cause (cf. Is. 10°) .§ — 13. Therefore] The mark of the second part of the double stro-

phe.— Since the prudent man at such a time is keeping silence] This general meaning for 5swm is to be preferred* to (1) the teacher, z.e. the prophet, whose function it was to rebuke evil at any cost f (cf. 5'* 7°* Dn. 12° 1 K. 18"), perhaps Amos him- self; { or (2) the official whose duty it was to restrain and punish crime. § It includes all who might, under ordinary circumstances, be expected to rebuke the public iniquity. The fact is stated, that, a¢ such a time, t.e. under the present circumstances, injus- tice so prevails that speech will accomplish nothing.|| There is no indication of reproach uttered against the prudent. The translation, therefore shall he who understands this time keep silence, for it shall be an evil time, connecting “in that time” with the preceding word, erroneously refers the utterance to a future time rather than to the present. The whole clause is cir- cumstantial, and as such subordinate,—a construction well ex- pressed by the conjunction s¢mce. — It is surely an evil time] A time which promises disaster.—14. Seek good and not evil] The ad- vice has already been given to seek Yahweh (v.’; cf. v.% Mi. 69). The force of the imperative is not really hortatory, but conditional, and it implies a threat, that unless good rather than evil is sought, national death awaits them. — Zhat ye may live] In other words, unless you seek good, a thing which you are not now doing, you will die politically. — Zhat¢ so] z.e. in case ye do so ;} not, in like manner as,** nor “so,” corresponding to "wK>.tt — Yahweh... may be with you| In the special sense of extending help and giving prosperity.— God of Hosts] t.e. the God who rules heaven and earth is able to render any and every kind of help. — As ye have said| Israel, of course, always maintained that she was loyal to Yahweh. She had always regarded herself as, in a peculiar sense, the people of God (Je. 7 Mi. 3"). Has her life justified the idea.? Unless her whole attitude changes, unless good and not evil is made the end of her national life, that life shall cease, and the much talked of fellowship of God will be lost.

15-17. Only righteousness will avail against the calamity which is coming. —The third and last of the double strophes does not at first sight seem so compact and logical as those which have preceded. Indeed, v.” (w.s.) is thought by most commentators to be the desired continuance of v.4 and to have no connection with what follows.* In the preceding sub-sections, the prophet has pictured Israel’s iniquity and ruin. In the first, all was dark ; in the second, a slight suggestion of hope was given, provided her method of life was changed ; in the third, the case is presented more strongly in the form of an exhortation, followed by the distinct assertion that perhaps Yahweh will be gracious, etc. There is seen, therefore, a gradually increasing representation of pardon, a thought which filled every prophet’s heart, no matter how dark the picture which he painted. In this sub-section, as in the other, there occur the reference to the “ gate,” and the introduction of the conclusion by “therefore,” although the logic of it here, it must be confessed, is not so clear as in the other case.

15. Hate evil and love good] Already in the preceding strophe a hint has been given of the possibility of pardon. The sugges- tion made, “Seek good and not evil,” is now repeated in even stronger form, as the condition on which pardon may be secured. The abstract “ evil” and “ good” is better than the concrete “ evil man,” “good man.” * The positive command is needed to sup- plement the negative, for to hate evil is not sufficient unless one seeks good.f{ The speaker’s purpose to impress his thought by repetition is seen in comparing “ hate ” of v.4 with “hate” of v°. The standard of good and evil, in his mind, is conformity with Yahweh's will. — And establish justice in the gate] In other words reverse the present condition of things; + the reference is not to the restoration of true worship instead of calf-worship, § nor to the improvement of private morality, but to the execution of public justice. || — Perhaps] Cf.

§ 10. The doom of captivity. 5%-6™. (1) A woe against those who pray for Yahweh’s day: it is a day of judgment; be- cause of formal feasts and noisy songs, without justice and right- eousness, the nation shall go into captivity, saith Yahweh (5°). (2) A woe upon those who are careless and indifferent: because of the luxury, the licentiousness and the apathy of the people, the nation shall go into captivity, saith Yahweh (OD. 4(3) An oath against the proud and self-confident Israel: because of this pride and bold audacity, this self-dependence and disre- gard of justice, Israel shall be supplanted by a foreign nation, saith Yahweh (6°").
This poem consists of three triple strophes, each strophe of the nine con- tains six lines. In each triple strophe, the first presents a woe (in the third, this woe becomes an oath); the second presents a phase of the wickedness of the situation (eg. (1) the utter formality of worship, (2) the luxury of life and apathy of feeling, (3) the pride and self-confidence); the third pictures the coming captivity (e.g. (1) a captivity beyond Damascus, (2) a captivity at the head of the captives, (3) the complete surrender of the country to a foreign enemy). The symmetry of the three divisions is almost perfect, each beginning with a woe (or oath), each ending with sazth Yahweh in one form or another. The logic and symmetry of this section are completely destroyed by Elh., who places 518-20 between 3° and 3°; 57% between 3/4 and 4}; 5%6f between 4° and 4*; 6! between 4! and 4%; 67 between 4!2 and 418; 68 between 41? and 5}; 69-11 between 52 and 54; 6!2f be- tween 5° and 56; 64 between 5° and 7}. Lohr does not recognize the unity and independence of this section, but treats it in connection with 511", He arranges 518-614 in eight strophes, consisting of 4, 10, 4, 4, 10, 10, 4, and 4 lines respectively. This involves the omission of 51? * and 629.10, the transposition of 6° to follow 684 and the addition of an extra line after miby in 522 as well as before »nbam) in 52%, and disregards the logic of the passage at some points. Baumann’s reconstruction is still more radical,

18-27. A woe upon ignorant zeal for a corrupt worship, in which no place is found for justice or righteousness! A cap- uvity beyond Damascus awaits you.— The unity of this section (consisting of three six-line strophes) appears in (1) the outer form, as compared with the other sections, and (2) the thought which centres about the cultus. This cultus includes the great doctrine of ‘“ Yahweh’s day” as well as a regular set of feasts, and offerings; it is not wholly detached from images—all of which are wrongly understood, and wrongly practised, and for this reason lead to ruin.
It is best to regard as interpolations (1) mov 0b arand, v.J8; (2) wax xd oan ober, v.22 (v2.). It will be noted that in the third and fourth lines of each strophe the poet allows himself to prolong the measure, a pentameter being substituted for a trimeter evidently in order to lay emphasis upon the thought by increasing the details given. The fact that this occurs so uniformly in each strophe shows that it is intentional. It would be possible, of course, to make two trimeters in each case (or a trimeter and dimeter), the strophes having eight instead of six lines.

Jo. 2? 34%. The prophet does not speak to (1) those who in their misery and distress think that the coming of Yahweh, even if it brought death, would be better than their present situation ; § nor to (2) the credulous and superstitious Israelites, who, trusting in their Israelitish descent, and mindful of promises made to their ancestors, but forgetful of the obedience on which the promises were based, and of their own conduct which was the occasion of the evil situation, blindly imagine that Yahweh’s day can bring only good ;|| nor to (3) the bold and reckless sceptics who did not believe that the day would ever come, and thus mocked the suggestions by the prophet to this effect (cf. Is. 5" Je. 17” Ez. 12”).4 He has in mind, rather, (4) the great multitude, who think that without reference to their conduct, or the attitude of their mind, this “coming day” will be a “cure-all” for every woe.** It does not, however, follow from this, as Wellhausen contends, that Amos would have “ protested against the Messianic belief, if he had known of it.”
Amos found a well-established doctrine of the day of Yahweh cherished among the people. They looked forward to it as a day when Yahweh would give them triumphant victory over all their enemies and thereby establish himself as supreme among the gods. This hope grew out of their monolatrous conception of Yahweh and their belief in their own nation as destined to become the great and powerful representative of Yahweh among the nations, and was fostered by the long-continued hostilities between Israel and her neighbors, in which Israel was not always victorious. The day must come, therefore, in which Yahweh would gloriously vindicate himself and his people by overthrowing all his foes and making Israel supreme. But the idea as expressed by Amos was, in one essential point at least, directly contrary to the prevailing thought ; instead of Israel triumphing over her enemies on that day, she is herself to be humiliated, and that by Yahweh himself. This new conception of the day was the direct outcome of Amos’s new conception of Yahweh as an ethical God, whose chief requirement of his people was right- eousness. Amos felt that in view of the moral corruption of Israel it was inevitable that Yahweh would punish her and thus vindicate his own righteous-

ness in the sight of the world. Other nations, too, were to be punished, not, however, as enemies of Israel, but as transgressors of the moral law. The new way thus marked out by Amos was trodden by all his successors. The development of the idea kept pace with the growth of the conception of Yahweh, and further modifications through successive periods were caused by the ever changing historical and social environment. For a systematic historical treatment of this subject see J. M. P. Smith, “The Day of Yahweh,” AJTh. V. (1901), 505-33. Other material will be found in R. H.

Deep darkness without any brightness in it | After repeating the very words of v.", changed for greater forceful- ness into the form of a question (perhaps Marti is right in treating v.”* as a gloss on v.", and joining v.”* to 8), the prophet employs another phrase in which still stronger words are used for darkness and light, viz. deep darkness, gloom, a darkness which grows greater and greater, without even a ray of light (cf.

The prophet represents Yahweh as entirely out of sympathy with the religious worship, and, indeed, hostile to it. It is the cultus which seems to the prophet to be the occa- sion of all trouble, since to this may be charged “ the illusion and the obstinacy” of the people. — Your feasts] Such festal gather- ings as the passover (1 K. 12”) and the feast of tents (1 K. 8%), not sacrifices; religious, not profane.§ Under this name were included the three annual festivals (Ex. 234 34”; cf. Dt. 16%). The name has its origin not in the dancing (3m) which was a feature of the feasts, but in the fi/grimage which was involved. || These festivals are hated by Yahweh (cf. Is. 11), not because they failed to comply with certain prescribed rules or regulations as to place ;{ nor because of calf-worship ;** nor because they were external, not including worship of the heart,tt for, up to this time, emphasis had not been placed on heart-worship ; but because they constituted a cultus which did not truly represent Yahweh, and must be abandoned, if true ideas of Yahweh were to prevail. {{— JZ will not smel/] A relic of the old superstition that the god actually smelled the savor of the offering (Gn. 87 Ex. 29" 30"). The term is used as one of several to express delight in, or acceptance of, a sacrifice (Lv. 26% Is. 11°); cf. mynK (5%).

While the old realistic idea has doubtless largely disappeared, the thought was originally like that which appears in the Babylonian story of the Deluge : * —
“ A peace-offering I made upon the height of the mountain; Each time I placed seven censers, Poured into them calmus, cedarwood and sweet-smelling . The gods inhaled the savor ; Yea, the gods inhaled the sweet savor ; The gods gathered like flies around the sacrificer.”’
Your festivals| Nowhere else does the plural of this word f occur. The singular means an assembly, especially of a religious character, is used as a synonym of 3n, and designates especially the festival of the seventh day of the passover (Dt. 16°) and the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles (Lv. 23% Nu. 29* 2 Ch.7°).{—It contains the idea of Aoliday,§ not that of solemn assembly ;|\ cf. 2 K. ro" 1S. r3Jo. m4.

The lyre or harp (also called psaltery) with as many as ten strings (Ps. 33”) was used in profane music (Is. 5” 14” Am. 6°; cf.

The “stream” was at the rainy season a tor- rent, at other times a small brook or even merely the dry bed of a stream. But the stream, to fit the figure, must be never-failing, ever-flowing. —25.

The prophet has in mind the times of the wandering in the wilder- ness, times when Israel was treated with special favor by Yahweh, a favor which was evidently secured in some other way than by sacrifices and processions. These were the times which antedated the introduction of Canaanitish impurity into the Yahweh worship. His face is set severely against recognizing this sort of thing as pleasing to Yahweh. This kind of worship will not merely fail to turn away his anger; it is, in itself, an occasion of displeasure. The condition of heart and mind which it represents is sufficient evidence that only punishment of the severest character will meet the exigencies of the situation.—27.

For formation as a common noun, cf. ys (Ez. 3915); Sta. § 228. In connection with this interpretation may be noted (1) the suggestion of Muss-Arnolt (Zxp.5 Il. 414-28), who transposes v.25, placing it between vs.23 and 24, omits v.76 as a marginal gloss, emending it as follows: “11 ODD>¥ 2319 JYI7NN) DDN, translating: And now ye worship Ninib as your decider (or hing), and even as your elohim; and the star Saturn, as your idol which, etc. He takes wi here in the sense of the Assyr. naSé gd¢d = lift up the hands = pray to, wor- ship; and 7>p as equivalent to the Assyr. mal(i)ku which is applied to Ninib and other gods; and accounts for the selection of these names from the many Assyrian gods by the fact that the star Kaimanu, the star of the god Ninib, is spoken of as the star of justice and righteousness (kakkab kettu u me-Sar, II. R. 49, No. 3, 41), hence was chosen with reference to the thought of v.24, (2) The opinion of Che. that the “proof of the Assyriological ex- planation is so nearly complete that we ought not to hesitate to accept it (Exp V. 42-443 abandoned, however, in Crit. Bid. in favor of a Jerahme- elite explanation); but the cultus here designated (that of Sakkuth and Kaiwan) was not known in Israel until after 722 B.c. (cf. 2 K.17%). An insertion of this kind is seen perhaps in Is. 104, (3) The suggestion of Baethgen (Sem. Rel. 239) that there are four proper names of deities, viz. Sak- kut, Kaiwan, Moloch, Selem. (4) The suggestion of G. A. Barton (Oriental Studies, Philadelphia, 1894) that Amos refers to a cultus that was at least probably present in his own day; since in one of the Z/-Amarna letters from Jerusalem mention is made of a city Beth-Ninid, an evidence of the worship of Minid, or Saturn, in Palestine. (5) The suggestion of Tiele (Rev. d. Phist. d, rel. II. 211), who makes these divinities purely Phoenician. (6) The objection to the interpretation which makes the prophet refer to the carrying into exile, by Israel, of Assyrian gods, that, as a matter of fact, the victors would carry off the idols of the vanquished nations (We.; cf. Hi.). (7) The reading of Haupt, 24. TI. 266, 281 f., y»> (for TDN), the Hebrew form of the Babyl. name Ka am4nu. (8) The opinion that Sakkuth and Kaiwan are per- haps two names for the same god; since Sakkuth is an ideographic writing for the god Minis, and Ninid seems to be the god of the planet Saturn (= Kaiwanu), and Sak-hut and Kaiwanu are associated, as here, in the Shurpu tablets; cf. IV. R. 52, col. 4, 1. 95 and Zimmern, Beitr. zur Kenntnis der Bab. Rel. (1896), p. 10, 1. 179 (so R. W. Rogers, ZB. I. 749; Muss- Arnolt, Exp IL. 414-28). (9) The carrying of images in procession among the Hebrews is not at all improbable in view of (a) the references to the carrying of the ark in the wilderness, around Jericho (Jos. 6), and into battle (as at Gilboa); (4) the same custom among the Assyrians, as at the New Year’s procession (cf. Jastrow, Rel. of Bab. and Assyr. 679; C. J. Ball, Light from the East, 173); and (c) among the Egyptians (cf.

The unity of this section (the second section of three six-line strophes) is seen in (1) the outer form, and (2) the single thought which it presents, viz. the sinful luxury of the nation (v.2, pass over to Calneh, etc., is a later inser- tion, v.z.). The structure of the section is characterized by the constant re- currence of the ptcp. with the article, followed by a finite vb. in cases in which it is desirous to prolong the thought. Each of the couplets (except the ninth) presents a single characteristic of the nation, viz. (1) recklessness, (2) conceit, (3) procrastination, (4) luxury, (5) gluttony, (6) enervation, (7) drunkenness, (8) hardness; therefore (9) captivity.

Much may be said for the reading of % (v.s.), “and spoil for themselves the house of Israel.”” Cf.

Gath] With this verse must be compared Na. 3° Ju. 11” 2 K. 19”. The determina- tion of the localities depends somewhat upon the age of the verse. Is the verse as a whole encouraging, and intended (whether by Amos or a later editor) to strengthen Israel’s claim that she is the first of the nations? In this case these cities are cited as ex- amples of prosperity, and the argument is: “No city of your acquaintance is more flourishing than yours ; yet ye treat Yahweh, who has given you this prosperity, with neglect ; the punishment for this conduct is exile.’* But (see Nowack) (1) contemporaries of Amos needed no such encouragement in their faith; (2) the mention of Gath would have no meaning in such a comparison while Assyria and Egypt were in existence; (3) “these king- doms”’ must mean Calneh, etc., not Israel and Judah. Or, is the verse threatening, and intended to warn Israel that she, however “ first’? she may be, shall perish ? In this case these cities are cited as examples of “ fallen greatness” (Driver), and the argument is: “If cities that have been great are now in ruins, Israel, like- wise, may perish.” The latter view is to be accepted (v.s.).— Calnch] (cf. m3, Gn. 10%; a3, Is. 10°; m3, Ez. 27”) is not Ctesiphon, on the Tigris ;{ nor Niffer;§ nor Kullani, mentioned in the Eponym Canon || as conquered by Tiglathpileser III., B.c. 738 (= modern Kullanhou, six miles from Arpad ; cf.

Orontes, 150 miles north of Damascus, the northernmost limit of the territory promised to Israel (Nu. 34°). At times it was a part of the Israelitish kingdom (as under David and Solomon, its king being Tot, 2 S. 8°, and perhaps under Jeroboam II., 2 K. 14%” Am. 6”); at other times, it was independent and allied with neigh- boring nations against Assyria, as when it joined with Syria and Israel against Shalmaneser II. and was defeated, 854 B.C. ; or with Judah, against Tiglathpileser III., 741; or against Sargon, 720, when at last its subjection was complete.

Or ts their border greater than your border ?| With this rendering the sense is, Are the cities just mentioned fairer than the kingdoms of Israel and Judah ? No; for God has so punished them that they are reduced in size.

ing the thought when he made it mean, “ Are they, Israel and Judah, better than these (7c.

This inter- pretation is in strict accord with Na. 3°. With this interpretation it becomes clear that the verse is an interpolation from the end of the eighth century (v.s.).— 3. Who postpone the day of calamity | The connection of this with v.! is very close both logically and grammatically.

used to accompany the voice ; but the context is not favorable to the allusion to instruments, hence (v.s.) Cheyne’s suggestion, voice of song, Elhorst’s words of song, Nowack’s ai kinds of song, and Marti’s consider themselves like David in the under- standing of song. —6. Who drink (from) bowls of wine| Another token of self-indulgence. Instead of the ordinary drinking-vessel, the word is employed which is later used of the vessel from which blood was poured or thrown (dashed) for sacrificial pur- poses (Ex. 38° Nu. 4% 7* Zc. 9” 14”), the large size thus being emphasized. — With the first of oils they anoint themselves| Anoint- ing in ancient times signified not only consecration, but joyousness (cf. Ps. 23° 92” Is. 61° Ec. 9’ with 10). It was a hygienic cus- tom, since the oil refreshed the skin and served as a protection against heat. In this case the first of otls, i.e. the choicest oils, are employed. To omit anointing was a sign of mourning (2 S. 12 14°).— And do not grieve for the breach of Joseph] Their minds are so occupied with the mirth and joy that they fail to see, and hence to appreciate, the terrible breach or wound which, in the near future, will be inflicted upon Israel. Such a sight as that which the prophet has gained would make them sick in body and in mind (cf. 1 S. 22°); for a great affliction or overthrow (cf. Je. 8") is near at hand. This word breach does not refer to any specific political intrigue,* nor to the present evil condition of Israel,f but to the future calamity which even now threatens the nation.{ —7.

hasten, exceed due bounds, be immoderate, talk excessively (Lane, p. 2376); hence Dr., following Abul-Walid (Neubauer, 4dul-Walid’s Lexicon, col. 586), suggests “to extemporize poetry over-rapidly, without premeditation, in a hurried flow of unmeaning, unconsidered words” (v. Dr. p. 236; Now.). Observe, likewise, Hoffm.’s rendering, “those who strike the strings across the opening of the harp,” which is based on the usage of wx» (Ly. 191°), to tear (cf. Buxtorf, Lex. 1811 f.; Payne Smith, Zhesaurus Syriacus, p. 3311), and makes the .» %y entirely superfluous. —52)] The kinds of instru- ments denoted by the two names 433 and 735 are not certainly known. The two are the only stringed instruments mentioned in the O. T., and are frequently named together (Is. 512 1 Ch. 1516 2 S. 65, etc.). Both seem to have been made of wood (1 K. 10!) and to have been portable (1 S. 105 2S. 65). A full discussion of these and other instruments, with excellent illustrations of Assyrian, Babylonian, and Egyptian harps, etc., is given in Bk. of Ps. (SBONT.), 222 ff.; cf. Dr. 234 ff.; Benz. Arch. 273 ff.; Now. Arch. I. 273 ff.—6. ‘a nnw] = to drink from, cf. Gn. 445; same force in Arabic and Aramaic (Dn. 5”). For the same phrase = ¢o drink of, cf.

The primitive significance of anointing was probably re- ligious ; animal fat was the first unguent, and, being regarded as the special seat of life, was considered the best medium for the transmission of the vitality of the being from which it was taken; hence “unction was primarily an application of sacrificial fat with its living virtues to the persons of the wor- shippers” (WRS. Sem. 383f.). This accounts for the anointing of kings, priests, etc., and for the use of unguents in connection with religious rites. Olive oil was used later when agriculture was taken up (Ps. 92!! Dt, 284

Joseph is named as the ancestor of Ephraim, the largest tribe (cf. Ho. 6* 13!). The use of the title occurs each time in a connection implying a bond of sympathy between Israel and Yahweh, or at least a shade of tenderness in the feelings of Amos.
8-14. Vahweh makes oath: I abhor Israel, and she shall be given over to her enemies for destruction; she has turned justice to poison, imagining herself strong; surely I will bring upon her a nation which shall overcome her entre territory.
The striking difference between the grammatical expression in this piece (the third of three six-line strophes) and that in the preceding is evidence of distinctness ; but when there is considered in connection with this (1) the opening oath (v.8), which is climactic to the woes introducing the other pieces, (2) the concluding words, which are parallel to those of the other pieces, we have sufficient basis for the assumption that this is one of three pieces making up a larger whole. Vs.?:!0 are so peculiar in their thought and form as at once to raise suspicion of their genuineness ; this suspicion be- comes a certainty upon closer investigation (v.z.). The intensity of expression, as well as the definiteness of this section, is greater than in either of the two preceding. It thus furnishes a fitting climax for the entire piece, containing, in essence, the threefold thought of the whole, viz. (1) Yahweh’s anger, because of (2) Israel’s sin, and consequently, (3) Israel’s destruction.

§ 11. Three visions of destruction. 7°. These three visions were probably announced at Bethel: * (1) a vision of devouring locusts, the destruction stayed by the interposition of Yahweh’s hand (7") ; (2) a vision of devouring fire, the destruction stayed again by the interposition of Yahweh’s hand (7**); (3) a vision of a plumb-line, the destruction this time permitted to become
complete (77°).t
Contrary to the usual interpretation, this section, like those which have pre- ceded, is a poem. I reached this conclusion in March, 1897; see BW. Nov. 1898, pp. 333 ff.; cf. Elh. De profetie van Amos (1899); Lohr (1901); Baumann (1903). The form and style are in many respects similar to those found in the first pieces (chaps. 1 and 2). The poem consists of three stanzas of nine trimeters each. These stanzas present in common a remark- able symmetry, each falling logically into three subdivisions; the first and second are strictly parallel throughout : —

Of the nine lines five in each are practically the same; in the remaining four there is a similarity of plan; cf. 737, line 2, the forms of bow in lines 4 and 5; and the same logical division comes at the end of each triplet. Con- cerning the corrections of the text, viz. (1) omission of sonra ane wpd mm (v.1) and (2) the reading of nbop xv 1m (v2), v2. The third stanza is from its nature essentially different, and yet the difference is one of thought rather than of form. With the omission of v.84 (v.2.) the arrangement is as follows : —

1. Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me] This is the uniform introduction to all the visions except the fifth (9'). There is no evidence to show whether the vision came in a dream, or in ecstasy. Indeed, it is not necessary to suppose that either of these methods was employed. They are, nevertheless, real visions, since the writer clearly distinguishes between them (to- gether with the fourth vision in 8'*) and the historical episode in 70-17, _ Yahweh was forming| Cf. Gn. 2". To supply Yahweh as the subject brings the form of expression into harmony with the corresponding line of the second stanza, and makes unnecessary the reading of "x. (formaton, breed) instead of the participle, although this is favored by 6S@ and many scholars (v.s.). The participle shows that the action was not yet finished. — Locusts | Perhaps, here, locusts in the larval stage.* Reference was made

in 4° to the sending of locusts for the purpose of bringing Israel to see the error of her ways. This was, of course, an act of mercy on the part of Yahweh. But here the mercy “appears not in sending the locusts, but in withdrawing them before they had utterly destroyed the vegetation of the country. It is the same plague viewed from two slightly different standpoints, from the first of which appears the active, from the second the passive side of the divine mercy.” * — Jn the beginning of the coming up of the aftergrowth| The ‘ aftergrowth’ was either (1) the second growth, the first being cut off, as here, for taxes, or for royal use,f or (2) a later grass which started up in March and April under the influence of the late spring rains.{ Ordinarily grass was not cut and made into hay, but was eaten, as it grew, by the cattle.§ Perhaps, however, in this case, it had been allowed to grow for the king’s levy for the support of the cavalry. || — And behold there were full-grown locusts after the king’s mow- ings| This is undoubtedly a gloss (v.s.) intended to fix more definitely the exact time of the invasion of locusts. Does this mean “he king’s mowings, which, as suggested above, were levied for the army, the people making no use of the grass until this levy had been taken away? This seems satisfactory, yet some take ‘3 in the sense of shearings, the time designated being the time of the king’s sheepshearing.** The translation locusts involves a change of text based upon © (v.s.). SMT has afeer- growth. The appearance of the larvae of the locust in the beginning of the coming up of the aftergrowth, and of fully developed locusts after the king’s mowings, is intended to rep- resent a destruction of herbage which threatened to be complete, since the latter appeared at a time when the rains were all past and the summer heat was just beginning.—2.

The first vision describes graphically a visitation of locusts sent upon Israel as a punishment, which, however, because of the intervention of the prophet was stayed before it had completely devoured the land. The prophet had in mind, according to some, an attack of locusts; | according to others, an Assyrian invasion, viz. that of Pul or Tiglathpileser III.,f’ or past punish- ment, of whatever kind, which had been only partial.**

meaning is (cf. Dt. 25% Is. 34%) Yahweh meets (i.e. comes near) to strive; but in favor of the ordinary interpretation is (1) the phrase in Am. 58, (2) the parallel in Is. 48"; cf.

The first and second visions are parallel with the list of inflic- tions in 4°"; others might have been added, but these two were typical of all the efforts which had been made to turn Israel from her evil way.

7. The Lord stationed beside a wall] JAC reads plumb-wall, but this is very difficult.* According to this interpretation the picture represents the Lord as a builder, and describes his char- acter. The wall beside which he stands is a token of his work, z.é. it is built by a plumb-line ; it is an ideal wall. It is only this kind of work which he will countenance. His work must be exact.f But all this is exactly contrary to facts, since the wall is condemned. The rendering of 42% by “ adamant,” ¢ referring to the unchangeableness of God’s decrees, or by “sling” § as more striking and as representing (v.°) the beginning of war, or by “plaster” || may not be accepted. The “wall” can hardly be taken allegorically as representing the people of Israel; nor is the plumb-line intended to signify the law or revelation.§ It is equally impossible to render the phrase “wall together with a plumb-line ” or a “ wall built to the plummet.” ** We may there- fore suppose that the word “ plummet,” which occurs legitimately in the next phrase, has crept in here by mistake. —W7th a plumb- fine in his hand] i.e. the purpose of the builder is to test the character of the wall, in order to determine whether it has been built thoroughly and exactly (cf. Is. 28”). There is here an antici- pation of the work of destruction which is to be spoken of later, for walls were destroyed by plumb-line, 7.c. thoroughly tt (La. 2° Is. 34" 2 K. 21). It is not enough to understand that the plumb-

line indicates the measurement of that part of the wall which is to be destroyed.* —8. Jam setting a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel| The builder will test the structure, and that which does not stand the test shall be destroyed (cf. texts cited above). — And J will not again pass by them any more| In the former visions Yahweh had permitted the intercession of the prophet, but now any request to this effect is anticipated and shut off. Zo pass by or over is to pardon (Mi. 78 Pr. 19”). Hoffmann’s translation of "13v by “harvest” has nothing in its favor.—9. Zhe high places] Down to the days of Josiah the nation worshipped Yahweh regularly and legitimately upon the so-called high places.f These were natural or artificial eminences chosen as being nearer the abode of the gods. Other nations had followed this same custom (Dt. 12?; cf. also Is. 15? 16%, and the Mesha-stone, l. 3). On these high places, an altar was raised, which was attended by priests (t K. 12% * 13%). When, in and after Josiah’s time, the centralization of the worship had been effected, in connection with the publication and acceptance of Deuteronomy, a ban was placed upon worship at the high places. But in the days of Amos this centralization had not taken place. When, therefore, he speaks reprovingly of the worship conducted at these places, it is not because of the many places as distinguished from one place, but because of the unsatisfactory (7.e. unspiritual, perfunctory) char- acter of the worship.— Of Jsaac] A synonym used by Amos alone for Israel.

The prediction is plainly one against Jero- boam’s dynasty; the great destruction is coming in Jeroboam’s time ; and, in the prophet’s mind, the destruction of the dynasty and that of Israel are synonymous. The ruin of Jeroboam’s house is not an incident in the general destruction, but the climax. The sword stands for the Assyrian army; cf. 6%.

This passage has always until recently (see my strophic arrangement in BW., Nov. 1898, pp. 333-8) been taken as a piece of historical prose thrown jn between the first and second groups of visions. It is clear that it is an episode growing out of former utterances of Amos (cf. Riedel’s suggestion that 710-17 was placed after 79 because the name Jeroboam occurs nowhere else in the book). At first sight it would seem to be prose; and yet mere prose would scarcely be expected even in an episode if we remember (1) the very early date of the work of Amos, and the tendency, at this early date, to describe all events in poetry; cf. Ju. chap. 5, Ex. 15118; (2) the fact that Amos in his introductory address, which was prosaic enough from one point of view, and very monotonous, nevertheless adopted the poetic form and worked out the various statements in so careful a manner as to make them seem almost artificial. If, now, we note still further (3) the many parallelisms which the passage contains; (4) the logical division into two parts (vs.10-18 and vs.#17); (5) the triple division of the first part, viz. v.!0 six lines, v.1t three lines, vs.12: 18 six lines; (6) the similar triple division of the second part, viz. vs. six lines, v.16 three lines, v.!” six lines; and (7) the measure of the first part, regular trimeter, and that of the second, regular tetrameter, we have sufficient data for supposing that this was originally intended to be poetry. The artistic skill which put the accusation in a trimeter movement, and the strong and terrible reply in the heavier and statelier tetrameter is charac- teristic of Amos. The symmetry is throughout extraordinary. Ldéhr (1901) also maintains the poetical character of this narrative and arranges it in five strophes of four lines each, the introductory statements in vs.1012 14.17 being regarded as prose: str. 1 =vs.l0-M; str. 2 —=ysl21; str. g=vs*s str. 4 =v.l6; str. 5 =v.l7. But this arrangement involves (1) the omission of mya sb ax from v.15; (2) the omission of noIw dyn aba Aba Sew from y.17; (3) considerable irregularity in the length of lines; (4) the treat- ment of 7DX ANN as a line, although the corresponding line, 77) 7px AD 395, in v.17 is not counted. Elhorst (1900) treats the passage as poetry and arranges it in three strophes: (1) vs. = 18 lines; (2) vs.1617¢ = 6 lines; (3) v7® = 3 lines. This arrangement exhibits neither symmetry nor logic.

10. And Amaziah the priest of Bethel| This outbreak led by the priest, perhaps a high priest (certainly not the only priest), was provoked by the scathing words which now for some time Amos had been preaching. It is not impossible to suppose that the interruption was due immediately to the utterance ofev But from the beginning the prophet had antagonized the priestly order. The interests of the priest were identical with those of the king. — Amos has conspired against thee| The prophet is not charged with having entered into actual conspiracy ; but rather with conduct of a deceitful and seditious character which would produce conspiracy. — Zhe land is not able to contain all his words| Either the land is too small, + the prophet’s words being too many and too atrocious; or, the people cannot endure the prophet’s work, because it is so hostile, the priest thus pro- claiming in hyperbolical fashion his own thought as that of the people.—11. Jeroboam shall die by the sword | The words of Amos here quoted by the priest contain only the subject of his preaching, and this, indeed, is given in a form which would be most likely to incite the king, for it wili be noted that (1) the actual statement of Amos was not personal; he said the house of Jeroboam (7°), ¢ although, while Jeroboam was still alive he was the principal member of the house ;§ (2) the reasons for Amos’s words are not given, viz. Israel’s sins and the prophet’s inter- cession. Perhaps, on the other hand, no concise statement of this kind could be more accurate, and it may therefore be an injustice to charge the priest with distorting or perverting the prophet’s words. || —Zsvael shall surely go away into captivity

These words had been uttered by the prophet ‘many times ; cf. 5° 7 6'.—12. And Amaziah spoke unto Amos| This message was sent by the priest to Amos, either (1) because his. words to the king produced no effect, and he was compelled there- fore to act upon his own authority ;* or (2) after the message had been sent to the king and before the answer had been returned ; in this case they were prompted by a friendly desire to have the prophet avoid the king’s wrath, } or, as seems most plausible, (3) on the authority of the king, the statement to that effect being omitted; { such ellipses in conversation are very common; cf. Is. 7°. There is no evidence (4) that an un- satisfactory answer had been received from the king, and is left unmentioned because it was unsatisfactory.§ — O thou Seer /] Cf. the rendering, vséonary. || The history of In is brief: § in pre-exilic literature it is used only of Gad (2S. 24", cf. 1 Ch. 21°) ; in later literature it occurs 2 Ch. 29” (Gad), 1 Ch. 25° (Heman), 2 Ch. 9” 12% (Iddo), 19? (Jehu, son of Hanani), 29” (Asaph), 35% (Jeduthun), and (in the plural) Is. 29” 30% Mi. 37 2 Ch. 33”. The other word translated seer, N45, is said (1 S. 9°) to be the oldest designation for prophet, and is used as a title only of Samuel (1 S. 9° * 1 Ch. 9” 26” 29”), of Hanani (2 Ch. 16"), and in plural, Is. 30. Amos had just announced three visions ; it was appropriate to apply to him this title ;** but it is also probable that mockery was intended, much as if we should say, “© thou gazer!” tt — Go, flee thee to the land of Judah] This is not the advice of a friend; but the command of one in au- thority. In Judah, the prophet’s own land, he might say con- cerning Israel what he pleased. — Hat bread there and prophesy there| To understand this it must be noted (1) that in the ear- lier days there were soothsayers, rather than prophets, {{ whom the people consulted about the affairs of life, making a gift for the privilege of the consultation (cf. 1S. 9”*); (2) that these soothsayers constituted local guilds (¢.e. the schools of the proph- ets), and, for the most part, restricted their work to a particular locality, securing their livelihood by means of the gifts received,

i.e. from charity; (3) that in later times the great mass of the so-called prophets were only soothsayers of this character, receiving rewards from the people for speaking according to their wishes(cf.Is., 30” ‘Mi..3° Ez..13” 1K. 22” Je. 23%" 284 29°") ; (4) that, in every case, those whom time has shown to be true prophets were, like Amos, bold in their utterance, and regardless of public opinion. ‘The priest is anxious to dismiss Amos, for he supposes him to be a soothsayer, and therefore one who is in sympathetic touch with the masses of the people, and these, as always, are ready to rise against those who are in authority. He orders him to go to Judah, where he will have no difficulty in making a livelihood by uttering invectives against Israel, for the people of Judah will be pleased to hear of any calamity which threatens Jeroboam II.—13. But at Bethel thou shalt no longer prophesy| Cf. 2%. Then follow two reasons for this banishment: (1) Bethel is the place of the king’s sanctuary, z.e. the principal headquarters in the kingdom for the national religion; and (2) it is the royal residence; these, of course, were the very reasons why Amos desired to preach in this place. — 14. And Amos answered and said | With these words the move- ment leaves the lighter trimeter, and becomes a heavier, more sonorous tetrameter. The opening words are strong: / am no prophet, nor a prophet’s son, etc.) “ Amos was the founder and the purest type of a new phase of prophecy.”’* The use of the past tense, J was no prophet, etc. (t.e. when I was called), to avoid a contradiction ¢ with v.”, is based upon a misconception of the meaning of the prophet’s words, which is, “I am not a prophet by profession, nor am I a member of a prophetic guild.” f The literal use of the phrase, prophet’s son, has been defended § on the ground that among false prophets the office was trans- mitted from father to son; but for this no evidence exists. The other interpretation depends upon (1) the general use of the word “son” in Semitic in the sense of de/onging to, (2) the name applied to the companies of prophets at Bethel, Gilgal, etc. (cio K. 20% 2 K. 2%°7, etc.).— A shepherd am I] See on 1.

—And a dresser of sycamores| This occupation was of the lowest in rank, and, joined with that of herdsman, it indicates the humble origin of the prophet. obia has been thought * to refer to the “piercing” of the fruit in order that it might ripen; but the verb is better understood as signifying “to tend or dress the fruit of the sycamores” (v.7.). This fruit resembles a small fig, although it is very insipid in taste. The tree “grew abun- dantly in the mild climate of the Shephelah, or Maritime Plain (1 K. 10% 1 Ch. 27%), as it does still in that of the deep Jordan valley; in Egypt, where it also grew (Ps. 78”), and where it is found still, its wood was used for doors, boxes, coffins, and articles of furniture (Wilkinson-Birch, Amc. Eg. I]. 416). It attains the size of a walnut tree, has wide-spreading branches, and, on account of its shade, is often planted by the wayside (Lk. 19*). The fruit grows, not on the branches, but on little sprigs rising directly out of the stem, and in clusters like the grape —it is something like a small fig in shape and size, but insipid and woody in taste” (Driver, p. 207). —15. Go, prophesy against my people, Israel | It was while he was following his occupation that the mes- sage of Yahweh came to him, a message which he could not refuse to obey, a command, indeed, to go north to Israel, and to preach against her. The prep. 5x is euphemistic for Sv (cf. v.1*). This usage in a bad sense (cf. Je. 26" * 28% Ez. 6%) is clearly indicated by the context.{ ‘There is a note of yearning” in the suffix *_ of “ey (cf. “thy” in 9”).§ —16. Mow, therefore] All that has been said thus far is preliminary, the real word is yet to be spoken. — Zhou sayest] A marked antithesis is made between the thou sayest of Amaziah and the Yahweh hath said (v.").— Thou shalt not preach] "21 in Hiph. is here first used of prophecy (cf. Mi. 2*” Ez. 2177 Jb. 29” also Ct. 4% Dt. 327). The transfer of drop to preach may rest upon the idea that the word of prophecy drops refreshingly like dew upon the obedient, weari- somely upon the disobedient ; || or, better, may have been suggested by the flow of prophetic speech when in the ecstasy. The verb is here essentially synonymous with 82) of the parallel clause,

and does not carry with it any contemptuous idea.—17. Zhy wife shall be a harlot in the city| This does not imply that she is already one of the mwsp of Baal;* or that she shall enter voluntarily into whoredom, in order to obtain her accustomed luxuries ;f or that she will be seduced by the conquerors ; ¢ but that she shall be forcibly ravished,§ and that i” she city, te. in public (cf. 1° Is. 13% La. 5" Zc. 14”), the disgrace being all the greater. || — Zhy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword | z.e. thy children. The daughters were generally taken as wives for the soldiers, but the punishment is here extraordinary.— Zhy land shall be divided by line] This distribution of land to colonists was in accordance with the Assyrian policy after the time of Tiglath- pileser III. (cf. 2 K. 17% Mi. 2* Je. 6”). The line was, of course, the measuring-line. — Zhou shalt die in an unclean sowl| This . is characteristic of the early Israelitish thought. Any land in which Yahweh was not present was unclean (1 S. 26). More- over, Yahweh could not be present, unless he could be properly worshipped (cf. Ho. 9** Ez. 4%).§ The reference is probably to Assyria. It was for this reason, in part, that no place of wor- ship was established in Babylon during the exile. — Jsrvae/ shall surely go into captivity away from his land] The very words (v.") with which Amaziah had charged him are now repeated. This shows his daring. ‘These words were, after all, the sum and substance of his preaching. Perhaps he expected the captivity immediately. In any case, about twenty-five years passes before Tiglathpileser III. attacks Israel, and thirty-five before Samaria is destroyed by Sargon.

(2) Am address: O ye who are corrupt, who practise every manner of wrong-doing, against whom the earth quaked, but in vain—the day is coming when the sun shall be darkened, when slaughter shall prevail, when mourning shall be universal, when a famine for the presence of Yahweh shall fill the land, for he may not be found; when the strongest shall faint, when men shall swear by their gods, and when they shall fall, never to rise. 8*%7F9 end $10.

This section is a logical unit. It is composed of seven strophes of trimeter movement, each of six lines. Each strophe represents a step in the progress of the thought: str. 1 (vs.!-2), the vision that the end has come; str. 2 (vs.4®), a pointed arraignment of those who stand accused; str. 3 (vs.” 8), the threat of earthquake; str. 4 (vs.°8), the darkening of the sun, the slaughter of multi- tudes; str. 5 (v.10), deep and universal mourning; str. 6 (vs.l-!), the aban- donment of his people by Yahweh; str. 7 (vs.!5 14), despair, confusion, destruction.
The most important modifications of the text are the following: (1) The omission of v.24, — the question and answer, a gloss, after the style of Zecha- riah, which has crept in and supplanted the original third line of the strophe. This third line contained, perhaps, a further description of the yp a9, cf. a similar expanded form in 47 7!; (2) the transposition of v.%, describing the wailing because of slaughter, to follow v.°, thus making with v.? a complete strophe. In its present place v.3 has no meaning, while, after v.9, it not only continues the thought of terrible punishment, but prepares the way for the

following strophe, which is wholly given up to the thought of mourning; (3) the omission of v.°, which consists of the repetition, with slight changes, of 28, and the gloss yaw3 72 5pm; (4) the omission of the stereotyped phrases in v.24; mm... m7, Hial.’s transposition of vs.119"412 to precede g'! is at least unnecessary.

1. Thus the Lord Vahweh showed me] Each of the first four visions begins with the same words. — 4 basket of summer fruit | The word s:5> occurs only once outside of this passage, viz. in Je. 5”, where it is “cage” (cf. Assyr. Ac/wéi, bird-net). The
word was doubtless a general term for receptacle (cf. a <5 ; stitch, braid), used alike for cage or basket. The use of YP summer fruit (cf. Je. 24'*) is to be connected with the pp (end) of v.. The picture in the vision is suggested by the thought concerning Israel.—2. Zhe end has come unto my people Israel | The advance in thought between this and the former visions will be noted. The end is now close. Paronomasia, or punning, is not infrequent among the prophets.* It is not to be supposed that the words pp and p*p are at all connected etymologically.t — Twill not again pass them by| Cf. 7%. For v., v.2., p. 181. This vision is really a reassertion of the thought contained in the third vision, which had been interrupted. ‘Three interpreta- tions are suggested: (1) As summer fruit, when ripe, may not last long, so Israel, ripe in her sins, shall now come to an end. { (2) As summer fruit is plucked when ripe, so that it may not rot, so shall Israel be removed from home and carried into captivity. § But it is better to adopt another, viz.

Nor is it advisable to read “and on the Sabbath after the poor of the land” (v.s.), which spoils the parallelism, and fails to furnish a consistent thought ; or, “ye who oppress the poor ” (v.s.), on the basis of 4° and ©.— The poor of the earth| K*thibh "w; in Q’ri., ~y ; the latter = foor, wretched (of the physical state), § the former = humble, meek (of the spirit- ual). || The emphasis here is on the low and miserable social state of the poor (cf. 2’ Jb. 24* Is. 34*), for which either form would be a correct expression.§ —5.

This is the earliest allusion to the Sabbath in prophetic literature. — Diminishing the ephah and enlarging the shekel| The size of the ephah is not definitely known, being estimated at from 21.26 quarts (Thenius) to 40.62 quarts (Josephus).* The shekel given in gold or silver has been variously estimated, perhaps in gold 16.37 grains (= $10.80) ; in silver 14.55 grains (= $.60).f — FPerverting balances of deceit 7.e. providing false balances.

This verse consists of two elements, both of which are glosses or interpolations: (1) Zo duy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes| A double phrase, of which the first part is a modification and the second a repetition of 2°. + These lines stand in no close relationship with those which pre- cede (vs.**"?° refer to dealers in grain; °* has nothing to do with this) ; are entirely out of grammatical harmony with those which follow ; are a mere repetition (but in a different context) of 2°; and may not be adjusted to any satisfactory construction of the strophic system.— (2) And we sell the refuse of the corn] This phrase is interpreted, “ and buy (the needy) for a share by lot in the wheat for sale” ;§ is declared unintelligible by one, || and at least out of place by another.’ It is impossible to connect it gram- matically or logically with what precedes, although it is sometimes called the climax ** of the indictment, or the final proof of their ava- rice.t{ The whole is therefore to be taken as two later explanatory glosses, coming from different hands.

These are sug- gested by those with which the prophet is familiar. An eclipse had occurred June 15, B.c. 763,* the centre of which passed through Asia Minor at about 38-39° N. At Jerusalem (31° 46' N.) it would be visible “as a fairly large partial eclipse.” ¢ Reference to an eclipse of the sun has been found by some, aiege mt Mae 3° 2c. 4°. 0.92? 3!

This leaves our passage as the only clear case of an indirect char- acter.—3. The result of such an eclipse is the terror and dismay which first appear in connection with the palace life: che singing women of the palace shall wail] For text v.s. The word 527, Assyrian ekallu, means large house, used ordinarily of temple in Hebrew, although just as regularly of palace in Assyrian.§ An- other rendering is “ walls” (mim). || Some urge against the trans- lation palace the representation in 6*%, and the use by Amos of max to express the idea of palace (68 1*7” etc.) J; but this is not conclusive.

Some prefer to take the verb as imperative, “ throw them anywhere.” * If the text is allowed to stand, 5m is translated Hush!| So deep is the despair, and so great the danger, that silence is enjoined by those who are removing their dead (cf. the gloss in 6°"). But this is quite doubtful. The principal treatments of om have been: (1) as an adverb, zm silence; } (2) as an imperative, de silent; { (3) as an interjection ;§ (4) as connected with the following sentence ;|| (5) as a mar- ginal note added to express the feeling of some reader ;{f (6) omitted as unintelligible ;** (7) rendered, with a change of text (v.s.), “ casts bitterness’ ; ff (8) it is, most probably, a corrup- tion of 7, an abbreviation for youn (v.s.). The strophe is the most picturesque of this series. It is strictly logical — the eclipse — the slaughter — the confusion and despair of the burial. The dramatic effect is probably not so definite nor so strong as is sug- gested by G. A. Smith. —10. And I will turn your pilgrimages into mourning| The pilgrimages or festivals were the types of rejoicing (Is. 30% Ho. 2" La. 5”).— And all your songs into dirges| Cf. v8 and 5'.— Sackcloth] i.e. a coarse cloth made of goats’ hair or camels’ hair. It was the garb of prophets (Is. 20? Zc. 13 2 K. 18 Mk. 1°) and mourners (Is. 15° 22”), and was worn next to the skin (1 K. 21” 2 K. 6” Jb. 16” Is. 32"), being bound about the loins (Ez. 7'*), sometimes as the only garment (1 K. 207 21%), and sometimes under an outer cloak (2 K. 6”). It is prob- able that a loin cloth of sackcloth was the earliest dress of the Hebrews (cf. Erman, Life in Ancient Egypt, 200 ff.), and the use of it in mourning is an illustration of the general custom of retaining ancient forms and usages in religious ceremonies. {{ — Baldness | This was another sign of mourning; it was artificially produced, the hair on the forehead being shaved off (Dt. 141). It was a custom common to Hebrews, Moabites (Is. 15”), Phoenicians (Ez. 27°), Philistines (Je. 47°), Arabs (Agh. xv. 12), and many others. It seems to be a relic of ancestor-worship, the object of

it being to establish an inviolable covenant between the living and the dead, whereby the aid and protection of the latter are assured to the former. In Arabia the hair was deposited on the tomb. Hair, on account of its rapid growth, was thought to be a special seat of life and strength (cf. the story of Samson) ; hence, like blood, it was considered especially efficacious as a bond of union. For the later Hebrew use of the custom, cf. Is. 3% 22” Mi. 1% Ez. 7'8 etc.* — And I will make it| Not the land and its people, but the lamentation and sorrow of Israel on this terrible day. { — Like the mourning for an only son| An expression of the most intense sorrow, cf.

This is the climax of distress.
The arguments for treating this strophe (vs.- 1) as an interpolation (Oort, We., K6. (Zin/. 3042), Now., Che. in £B., Lohr, e¢ a7.) have little force. It is urged: (1) that literal and figurative thirst cannot properly be so closely joined; (2) that the formula in v.13 points back to v.%, and not to “Lo, the days are coming” (v.!1), But in answer it is to be said that (1) the word N35 (v.18) is a gloss; (2) likewise the words, “ Behold, the days are coming; it is the oracle of the Lord Yahweh” (v.'!); (3) these verses make a complete strophe, the essential thought of which, abandonment

Zhe fairest maidens and the youths | The flower of the people, and its strength, shad faint] This is no anticlimax ; nor is there real force in the argument for omitting this verse instead of vs."-%.* The moment one recognizes the division into strophes, it is perfectly clear that no difficulty arises in going from v.” to v.%.—14.

Stade, ZAW, III. 13, and Hoffmann, zd¢d. 123.— And say: as liveth thy God, O Dan] The calf at Dan, in northern Israel, near the base of Mt.

It is possible to understand “ way” of the method of worship at Beersheba (cf.

This fre- quent usage caused it to become little more than an emphatic form of state- ment, as is seen by the fact that Yahweh himself is spoken of as swearing to do or not do certain things (e.g. 68 Je. 49!8). Since oath was usually taken in the name of the god worshipped by the one swearing, it came about that swearing by a god was considered synonymous with worshipping a god (Dt. 618 1020 Je. 1216 Is. 48!).—n] Not the st. cstr. of the substantive on (Ew.® 329; K6.

This section is clearly composed of four strophes of six lines each. The movement is for the most part tetrameter, although occasionally for the sake of more vivid description it falls into the trimeter. Strophe 1 (v.!) presents the vision of the catastrophe; strophes 2, 3 (vs.2+) describe the utter impossi- bility of escape; strophe 4 (vs.7-8®) silences the objection, which, of course, an Israelite would urge, that Yahweh, as Israel’s God, could not thus humiliate her.
The more important modifications of the text are: (1) the treatment of vs.5-6 as a later interpolation, on the same grounds as assigned for 413 58 9; (2) the omission of v.8¢, “except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob; it is the oracle of Yahweh,” as a gloss inserted by a later hand to modify the absolute assertion of destruction made by Amos, and as a connect- ing link to the section of promise which was added, perhaps by the same hand.

This is not the beginning of a new verse, but a continuation of the vision,* for the picture includes the falling altar, those crushed beneath it, and also those who escape and flee to meet a death even more terrible, death by the sword.

—4. If they go (about) in captivity] Cf. 5%. The prophet has no definite place in mind—either in Egypt or Assyria. It is perhaps an allusion to another Israelitish conception, viz. that outside of Palestine Yahweh had no power over them; since in a strange and foreign land they would be under the power of the god or gods of that land; cf. Jon. 1%. From this point of view, the remark, “‘ Elsewhere exile is the worst threat; here that is surpassed,” * has no place. — Zhe sword and it will slay them| The serpent, upon Yahweh’s command, would bite them ; the sword, spoken of as a thing of life (cf. Ez. 32% Ho. 11° Is. 34°°%), at the same command, will slay them.—JZ wil put my eye on them for evil| This phrase, used elsewhere, “to keep watch over” (Gn. 44” Je. 24° 39”), z.¢e. in a good sense, is here defined in the bad sense.

Zhe Lord Vah- weh Sabaoth| The proposed logical connection of this verse with the preceding, ‘God is able to bring such punishments, because he is the almighty one” { is unnatural and far-fetched.

About this time upper Egypt with Thebes became a part of the Ethiopian territory.

part to unite in opposition to him. However, Shabako, probably the grandson of Piankhi, was the first Ethiopian ruler to seat him- self upon the throne of Egypt and actually administer its affairs. Israel, says the prophet, is no more to me than the far-distant, uncivilized, and despised black race of the Ethiopians ; cf. Je. 13”. No reference is made to their Hamitic origin,* or their black skin ;¢ and yet their color and the fact that slaves were so often drawn from them added to the grounds for despising them. { — Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt?) This is not to be read separately from what follows. The sense and syntax will be seen either by treating this clause as a protasis, viz. “If I brought Israel up from the land of Egypt (as you assert), did I not also bring the Philistines from Caphtor ?” etc.; or, more literally, by reading the three clauses in close connection. — Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor and Aram from Kir ?| Yahweh from his point of view was equally concerned in many, or indeed all, historical movements, of which three are cited as examples and placed side by side with that of the Israelites. This thought was probably not new with Amos ; it was involved in the general idea of the day of Yahweh, and must therefore have existed be- fore Amos’s day.§ All this is in answer to the objection made by certain narrow Israelites that Yahweh could not, if he would, desert Israel at this stage of his connection with them. — Caphtor] Not a part of the Nile Delta, || but Crete; cf. Dt. 2% Je. 474 Gn. 10% (in which, “from whom the Philistines came forth” should be transposed to follow “the Caphtorim”’).

The line is an extra one from the point of view of the strophic arrange- ment; it is flatly contradictory to the thought which precedes and follows; it has the tone of the later environment. The entire verse is late in the opinion of some.t{ The efforts made to explain the clause as a part of the text show at a glance the futility of the effort, e.g. “the favor here granted to Israel is a special one because of the covenant with their fathers.” {{ It is true that in later days (cf. Je. 5, 30, Ez. 14) this argument was urged by prophets and others; but at this time the prophet had just announced an exactly opposite position. — The house of Jacob | is, of course, the northern kingdom (5"** 6% 7% 2. 8"), for the prophet has had nothing else in mind from 7!.

§ 15. A later voice of promise. 9°°”. (1) A modification of the prophetic utterance concerning the exile, which shall not be doom, but a source of discipline, destruction coming upon the wicked only ; 9°**". (2) There will be a lifting up and repair- ing of David’s hut, now fallen, and the acquisition of all the terri- tory originally intended for Israel; 9». (3) There will be a return of numerous and plenteous harvests, a rebuilding of cities, and a replanting of vineyards; and Israel shall be permanently reéstablished ; 9. 2
This section is composed of three strophes of six lines each. Strophe 1, introduced by the transition clause, save that I will not utterly destroy, etc., furnishes the ground for what follows, viz. only the wicked of Israel shall perish; strophe 2 describes the political reéstablishment of Israel, including Judah; strophe 3 pictures the prosperity and permanency of restored Israel.
The chief reasons for denying this section to Amos are: (1) the many linguistic affinities between it and the works of exilic and post-exilic times (see especially Che. Zxf. 5th ser. VIII. 44 fi; Volz, 23; Dr. 119; Day and Chapin, 4/SZ. XVIII. 81; Grimm, Liturgical Appendices, 91); eg. VRYA (v.8%), Sw» (v.%), wrt (v.11), wan and sip (v.18) seriptio plena ; the late formula p82 DD 77 (v.18); the phrase ody ny; cf. Mal. 34 Mi. 7!# Is. 519 Je. 46%, which are late passages; the phrase maw 3, which is post-exilic; spabr, cf. Is. 4129 527 54° 66° Ps. 14712 Jo. 417; voy is later than wyyn, occur- ring only in Jo. 15 418 Is. 4975 Ct. 82; mown, cf, non, Is. 4919; a0 in Hithpa. only in Na. 15 Ps. 107%; (2) the fact that this picture of restoration is incon- sistent with Amos’s repeated announcements of entire destruction (cf. it, gi4.7); (3) a favorable attitude towards Judah, as distinct from Israel, is not characteristic of Amos; (4) the emphasis laid upon material blessings, ex- tension of territory, etc., to the exclusion of every moral characteristic, is in- consistent with the attitude of Amos, whose whole message is ethical; (5) the fact that the passage contains echoes of later writings, eg. cf, v.4 and Is, 11, v.84 and Ly. 265, v8 and Jo. 4!8, v.1¢ and 2 K. 19” Je. 149 29%. Is. 54% 6571 Dt. 28%f 39 Zp, 118; (6) the abruptness of transition from the announce- ment of destruction to the promise of restoration in v.85; (7) the use of the title qynbx is in opposition to the usage and thought of Amos (42 being a
196 AMOS
questionable passage); (8) Amos always represents the whole people as the object of punishment, but here a distinction is made between the righteous and the sinner which is characteristic of later thought; (9) the passage seems to look back upon a ruined nation (vs. 444); (10) Amos always con- templates an exile mm Assyria, not a scattering among the nations as here.

9. For behold I command| The later writer preserves the continuity of expression, by placing the words in the mouth of

The importance of the utterance is indicated by the use of Behold. ‘The participle represents the action as on the point of occurrence. —J will shake the house of Israel among all the nations| Every Israelite, good or bad, shall be subjected to the discipline (no longer doom) which is coming. Instead of a particular people, among whom Israel is to go captive, as else- where, the phrase “all the nations’”’ occurs, as in later prophets ; cf. Je. 43° Ez. 367. — Just as one shakes with a sieve| The sieve is ordinarily constructed in such a way as that the good grain is retained, while the light grain, the dust, and chaff fall through to the ground when the sieve is shaken. So the captivity is to be a means of sifting out of Israel all the wicked and worthless who are a disgrace and offence to the true people of Yahweh. — And not a kernel shall fall| The good shall remain in the sieve, ze. in exile, but the bad shall fall, ze. perish, "x= kernel or pebble ; cf. the following views: (1) that the nation is entirely chaff;* (2) that "179% = small stones which remain with the wheat, not one of them shall fall; (3) that it means firm and solid grain, z.e. something pressed together;{ (4) that peddle = wicked, who shall remain in the sieve, 7.¢. captivity, while the righteous fall out or escape;§ (5) that "x= pious, who are bound in a dunale that they may not be lost.|| In favor of the interpretation of ""¥ as grain are: (1) the fact that what remains in the sieve is the good element according to the description here, while the bad falls through; (2) the idea of destruction could not be expressed by the figure of preservation in the sieve, nor deliverance by falling through the sieve.{—10.

For a similar attitude of mind on the part of the wicked, cf. Am. 6%. Looking forward to Yahweh’s day as a time of joy and blessing (cf. 5%*), they scornfully refuse to heed the prophet’s warnings of calamity. With this picture of Yahweh’s day as a time of discipline and purification resulting in the preservation and strengthening of the righteous, that of Amos is in striking contrast ; cf. 5°” 391° 18,__ 11. Jn that day| Cf. the introduc- tory phrase in v.™, and the occurrence of both together in 8". — J will raise up the hut of David] This expression presupposes the exile, for the Davidic house is here reduced to a hut; cf. Hoff- mann (v.s.) who reads Auwfs, and interprets the phrase, not as having reference to the union of the two kingdoms, but as a picture of the coming restoration of the simplicity of Davidic days which Amos loved, the Aw¢s of David being contrasted with the palaces and forts of the age of Jeroboam. — Buzld it as in the days of old| This would hardly be appropriate in Amos’s days, but entirely so in later times. —12. That they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations| Cf. Ps. 60. This hostility towards Edom in particular seems to reflect the feelings of the exilic age; cf. Ob., Is. 63%, etc. This political exaltation of Israel at the expense of the nations in general is strangely discordant with the teachings of Amos; cf. v...— Which are called by my name| This does not mean “those to whom he shall have revealed his divine nature, and manifested himself as a God and Saviour”’; * nor “those who have been solemnly proclaimed by him as his property or subject-lands, which was done in his promises to Israel and David’s house’’ ; + but refers rather to the thought (cf. Je. 7 Dt. 28 2 S. 12%) that an owner’s name will adhere to what he owns, and to the fact that David had actually subdued extensive territory and made it submissive to Yahweh. t — 13. Zhe ploughman shall overtake the reaper, etc.| Cf. Lv. 26°. Ploughing and reaping will press close upon one another, the time of ripening will be so short; before the farmer has his crops all sown, it will be time for him to begin reaping those first sown. — And the treader of grapes him who soweth seed] 1.e. the vintage will be so abundant that seedtime will arrive before the vintage is

finished. Vintage begins-in September, while seedtime begins as soon as the October rains have made ploughing possible. — And the mountains shall drop sweet wine| Cf. Jo. 3%. The vineyards were commonly planted on the mountain slopes.— And all the hills shall melt It will appear as though the hills themselves were being dissolved in the copious streams of wine flowing from the vineyards on their sides.—14. J will lead back the captivity of my people| In Ho. 6", and everywhere in later writings (z.e. eleven times in Je., three times in Ez., Dt. 30° Ps. 126'* La. 2 Ps. 147 53° Zp. 2’ 3”), except in Jb. 42”, the phrase niaw aw may be given this meaning (v.7.). The other interpretation turn the for- tune (turning) of my people, based on the derivation of maw from Siw rather than 5w, is favored by some scholars (v.7.). The latter meaning is more general. In either case, the post-exilic origin of this utterance is clear in view of the detailed description which fol- lows, and seems to have been written in the light of experience. — They shall rebuild waste cities and inhabit them] Cf. Je. 33" Is. 54° 657. The opposite is seen in Zp. 1% Dt. 28°.— And they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine, and they shall make gardens (i.e. orchards), and eat their fruit| For similar ideals of the future see Is. 6571 Ez. 28%; and note the contrast between this and Amos’s outlook, 4° 5"; cf.

A COMMENTARY ON THE BOOK OF HOSEA.
§ 1. The superscription. 1'.* This superscription states the authority, the parentage, and the period of Hosea, the prophet whose writings make up the “collection. The superscriptions of the prophetic books, like those of the psalms, had their origin in many cases in an age later than that of the prophecies themselves. This fact explains the inconsistencies so frequently found between the contents of the superscriptions and the contents of the books. The data for determining the value of the statement must be gathered from the book itself. In the case before us, aside from the formal utterance concerning the prophet’s inspiration and the name of his father, the questions of special interest are: (1) Why should Jeroboam alone be mentioned of the Northern kings, when, if the other part of the date is correct, the prophet must have worked also during the reigns of several of the Israelitish kings, viz. Zechariah, Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah, Pekah, HosheaP (2) If Hosea was a Northern prophet, why is the work dated by Southern kings? (3) Did Hosea really prophesy during the period designated? (4) Consideration must also be given to the question of his home and nationality. These points, already referred to in the Introduction, will be taken up in the order suggested by the text.
L.1. Zhe word of Yahweh] While “law” or “ instruction ” (97n == decision by oracle) was the technical word for the divine com- munication through the priest, and “ counsel” (muy = “ the faculty of self-determination or devising of measures” f), cf. Je. 18”, for

that of the sage, “word” (155) is the term employed in connec- tion with the work of the prophet (cf. Am. 11 Is. 2? Je. 1? 2** 7} Ez. 6! 7) 12! 13! Jo. 11 Jon. 11 Mi. 11 Zp. 17 Hg. 1° Zc. 1! Mal. 1"). — To Hosea, the son of Beeri| The word Hosea (uwin) means de- liverance (cf. p. 205); with it may be compared the form Joshua (vwim). The same name was borne by the last of the Israelitish kings (733-722 B.c.), but the effort to identify this king with the prophet is without success. The name Beeri occurs only here ; cf., however, Beerah, 1 Ch. 5°. Among various traditions con- cerning Hosea may be mentioned (1) that which locates his birth and death in Belemoth* or Belamonf or Bethshemesh { of the tribe of Issachar; (2) that which represents his death as having taken place in Babylon and his burial in Tsepath in upper Galilee ; § (3) that which makes his burial place in Almenia, in Northern Africa. Leaving these stories, we turn to the book which bears his name for the information not elsewhere given. He was of Northern Israel; this appears from (1) the language of the book, which contains Aramaisms;|| (2) the phrases§ “our king,” 7°, “in the house of Israel I saw a horrible thing,” 6%; “the land” applied to Northern Israel, 17; (3) the special interest shown in Israel ;** (4) the peculiar information displayed in reference to their religious ¢¢ and political conditions, their past history, {{ and the topography of the country;§§ (5) his familiarity with the Northern love-poem, Song of Sengs, ||\| but this point can scarcely be substantiated ; (6) “the tone of Hosea’s religion, which is, on the whole, both warmer and more joyous (cf. chaps. 2 and 14) than that which prevails in the great Judahite prophets.” (4 It has been suggested that Hosea, like Amos, went up from Judah to Israel ;*** because (1) frequent references are made to Judah (2771 48 55 1014 6+ 1 84 y1!? 12), but these passages are doubtful,

and in any case do not involve such an implication ; (2) the super- scription dates the life of the prophet principally according to the kings of the Southern Kingdom, the name of Jeroboam being given to indicate the period of his prophetic activity in Israel ; but, as will be shown, the superscription is from a late hand, and consequently cannot be trusted for evidence of a character so subtle ; (3) the prophet’s attitude toward the people of Judah as compared with that manifested toward Israel; but under Uzziah, the people of Judah were comparatively upright, while idolatry with all its evils, and oppression with all its accompaniments, were rampant in Israel.* Nor does the use of the names of kings of both kingdoms indicate birth in one and work in another. More- over, the failure to give the birthplace of a prophet does not in- dicate that he was a native of Jerusalem.t — Jn the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel| This translated into dates reads: Between ca. 785 and ca. 775, reckoned by Southern kings ; between ca. 780 and ca. 745, reckoned by Northern kings. If genuine, this would mean that Hosea’s work began, at least before 745 B.c., and continued probably through 722 B.c.
As favoring this, and in explanation of the difficulties which have arisen, it has been suggested: (1) That the names of the Southern kings are inserted (a) because the line held a more permanent and dignified position, and its chronology was more trustworthy (Ma. 4); (4) because, as the prophet knew, they were the true kings (Hav. Z7m/. II. ii. 278; Ke. I. 11 f.; Hng. I. 166f.; Pu.); (¢) because they were the righteous kings, Jeroboam’s name being added for the reason that he too was righteous in not heeding the calumny against Amos (7!°); or (@) because it was customary to date one’s prophecies by the kings of one’s native land (Hosea being from Judah) (Mau.). (2) That the name of Jeroboam is added (a) in order that the prophet may give evidence of his knowledge to foretell future events, since he first threatens the evil in the prosperous time of Jeroboam (Cal. 38f.; Os. 509; Hng. 167; Ke. I. 12f.); or (4) because the prophet’s work was done in Israel (so most comm.); but the fanciful character of such suggestions is obvious. (3) That the names of the remaining kings of Israel are omitted because they were not regarded as real kings (Cocceius in Marck, 6; Hng. 168). In favor of the genuineness of the super-

scription it has been urged (1) that “ Shalman” (10!) refers to Shal- maneser (Hng. I. 169f.; Pu.); (2) that Jareb (5!8 10%) is the natal name of Sargon (Sayce, HCM. 417); (3) that the predictions of Assyrian invasion in 105. 6 1316 seem to refer to the immediate future (Huxtable); (4) that the allusions to the Egyptian relations (711 1114) are satisfied by the events of Hoshea’s reign (Ma. 341; Ke. 115f.; Hng. I. 170f.); (5) that 81° refers to tribute paid by Menahem to Tiglathpileser (Schm. p. 73)3 (6) that the whole description is one that accords literally with the period of the last days of Israel (Hng. I. 171 f.; Ke. I. 16). Against the genuineness of the super- scription may be urged (Ew., Sim., Wii.; WRS. Proph. 406 f.; Che:;. Dr. LOT. 301 f.; We., Or., Bach., Val., Now.; Da. D&. IL. 420; Marti, ZZ. II. 2121, e¢ al.; Oet.): (1) the inconsistency of placing the later date (Uzziah, etc.), ca, 780 to 775, before the earlier (Jeroboam) ca. 780 to ca. 745; when chaps. 1-3 seem to belong to the reign of Jeroboam (cf. the description of prosperity in chap. 2, which is applicable only to Jeroboam’s time; and the announcement of a yet future destruction awaiting the dynasty of Jehu, 1*), and chaps. 4-14, to the times which immediately followed; (2) the improba- bility that a Northern prophet would use for his dates the reigns of Southern kings; (3) the fact that in the prophet’s time Gilead was still Israelitish, 6° 1211; cf, 51; although in 734 B.C. its inhabitants were carried away by Tiglathpileser; (4) the absence of any reference to the attack of Pekah upon Judah in 735 B.C. (cf. Is. 7); (s) the probability that Hezekiah did not come to the throne until after the fall of Samaria, to which event Hosea looks forward (13!6 141) (We. Jahrbb. f- deutsche Theol. XX. 630; Wkl. Untersuch. 77 ff.; McCurdy, HPM. Il. 250; Marti, ZB. 796; Che. ZB. 2058; Gu. Gesch. 200; et al.)
The evidence points to the conclusion suggested above, that at least a portion of the superscription comes from the hand of a post-exilic scribe, who thus inexactly represents Hosea as a con- temporary of Isaiah (cf. Is. 11) and of Micah (cf. 1°), the name of Uzziah being omitted from the date of the latter to show that he was younger.*
 
* Various opinions regarding the origin of the superscription are: Hi. reads as original, “In the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel; then spake Yahweh to Hosea,” thus including a part of v.2, Sim. and Wii. treat the whole as late. Ew. takes the specification of the kings of Judah as a later addition from the hand to which we owe Is. 17, and considers the rest of the heading as original but belonging only to chaps. 1 and 2. Che. says, “ The first part, ‘the word,’ etc., may have been originally prefixed to a roll containing chaps. 1-3; the latter part was intended for the complete book; both parts were joined thoughtlessly at a late date.” Sayce declares the title to be older than the age of G, and to be the work of a native of Judah. It is inexact and imperfect and comes from a later

A family experience leads Hosea to un- derstand in some measure the love of Yahweh for Israel. This experience was, in a word, the adultery of his own wife, and the birth of children in this adultery. Some time after the events themselves have occurred, he tells the story, mingling with its details the new and precious truth which he has gained from the experience concerning Yahweh and Yahweh’s bride, the nation Israel. His narrative, like that of Isaiah’s vision (Is. 6) and Jeremiah’s later feeling in reference to the message concerning the purchase of the field (Je. 32°), reads into the events the significance which the later history suggests. The present text as rearranged includes: § 2. The harlotry of Gomer, the prophet’s wife, 17° (v.’, a later addition). § 3. The purchase of Gomer as a slave and her retention “ many days,” 3° (v.’, a later addition). § 4.

hand. Dr. supposes the original title to have had simply, ‘In the days of Jeroboam,” and to have referred only to chaps. 1-3 ; and the names of the Judean kings, contemporaneous with and subsequent to Jeroboam, to have been added in order to indicate that the book as a whole referred to a later period. We. and Now.2 say that only the beginning of the superscription, ‘“‘ The word of Yahweh which came to Hosea, son of Beeri,” is old. Now. thinks that if any part of the superscription is genuine, it must be ‘The word of Yahweh which came to Hosea, son of Beeri, in the days of Jeroboam, king of Israel.” This belongs only to chaps. 1-3. Marti (28.11. 2121), suggests “ words of Hosea, the son of Beeri” as the origina] form. Da. (DB. II. 420) grants the possibility of an early date for ‘‘ the words of Yahweh which came to Hosea, the son of Beeri.” Oct. rejects the entire chronological state- ment as coming from a later hand.

These names, like those of Isaiah’s children, were significant. The woman, after some years, goes from bad to worse. The prophet (1) is led to see in this a parallel with Israel’s treatment of Yahweh; and (2) through this domestic affliction is called to preach to his sinful countrymen.

208 HOSEA
A summary of the more important interpretations of the marriage of Hosea is here given.
I. A vision, a transaction in a dream or trance, and never carried out in real life (so Maimonides, AE., Ki., Hng., Ke., Wii., Tott., e¢ a/.). II. Closely allied to I., and, like it, based upon objection to a literal interpretation, is the view which makes it a parable, or allegory, or figurative mode of speech (so Rashi, Cal., Pareus, Crocius, De Wette, Schré., Hes., Hi., Sim., Bleek, Schm., Reuss, K6., e¢ a/.). In defence of both the above as against a literal interpre- tation it is urged (a) that to take it literally is a reflection upon the holiness of God, and imputes to Hosea conduct out of harmony with the character of a prophet; (4) that the woman in 3! is not the same as the wife in chap. 1, and that Hosea should have made two such marriages is improbable ; (c) that too much time was consumed by these events for Hosea ever to have used them as the basis of a striking appeal to the nation; (¢) that prophets often represent themselves as being under command to do things which could not have been done (eg. Ez. 42#); (e) that the chief emphasis in the whole narrative is on the symbolical names; (/) that the interpretation of the act is attached immediately to the command to perform the act, alto- gether after the fashion of vision and symbol rather than as in actual life; (g) that it would have been psychologically impossible for a man of Hosea’s character to have received such a command from Yahweh.
Against the preceding views, and in favor of a literal understanding of the narrative, it is urged (a) that what is morally and religiously objectionable in actual practice becomes no more defensible by being presented as vision or parable; (4) that no indication is given by the prophet that this is vision or parable and not fact (but cf. Je. 25 Zc. 11); (c) that the name Gomer bath Diblaim yields no symbolical significance; (@) that no symbolical meaning can be attached to the fact that the second child (v.®) is a girl rather than a boy; (e) that the literal view suits the realism of early proph- ecy better than the supposition that it is a product of literary imagination; (f) that prophets were accustomed to give symbolical names to real children (cf. Is. 73 88); and (g) that a real experience such as this furnishes the best explanation of Hosea’s message, — it was the outcome of the sufferings of his own heart.
III. Those who have maintained that a real marriage took place have differed widely among themselves. It has been held: (1) That Gomer was an acknowledged harlot (a2) who had already borne children (so Abarb., Grotius, Kurtz); or (4) who bore children to Hosea in lawful wedlock (so Béckel and Mau., interpreting 19 as showing that the children were Hosea’s own); or (¢) who bore, after her marriage, children whose parentage was uncertain (so Jer., Theodoret, Merc., Sanctius, Burkius, Dathe, Bauer, Ew., Hofmann ( Weissagung u. Erfillung, 205 ff.), Pu., Val., e¢ a/.).. The chief arguments in support of this view are (a) that the marriage thereby becomes a direct, obvious sermon against Israel; (0) the extraordinary character of the act was for the express purpose of attracting attention (cf. Ez. 129)
L2 209
and leading the people to question the prophet, and thus furnish him an opportunity to teach the lesson he desired; (c) if the act of 3! was a public one, as is generally maintained, why not also that of 12, since the form of the divine command is practically the same? (d@) the divine purpose of the marriage becomes clear —viz. to open the eyes of the people to its sins against Yahweh. The interpretation of Umbreit is worthy of mention in this connection, viz. that Hosea, thinking of Yahweh as the husband of Israel, and of himself as Yahweh’s representative to Israel, feels that he himself has contracted marriage with a harlot, since he by virtue of his prophetic calling sustains the same relation to Israel as Yahweh does. Against the view that Gomer was a public harlot are urged two objections which seem decisive: (@) that if this had been intended nj} would have been used instead of 093133 nwx; (4) that it is contrary to the regular custom of Hosea and the prophets in general, who always represented Israel as pure at the time of her union with Yahweh.
(2) Another phase of this view is that spiritual fornication is meant here, Gomer being a worshipper of idols, like all the Israelites of Hosea’s time (so New., Preiswerk, Sharpe, Riedel, Hal.). But if such were the case, Hosea’s preaching and his use of his wife for illustrative purposes would have had little force with people who were all sinners like his wife and saw no evil in their conduct.
(3) Some have held that Hosea took Gomer, the harlot, not as a full wife, but only as a concubine (so Thomas Aquinas, Schmidt). But this is even less acceptable than (1).
(4) Another attempt to escape difficulty is the view that makes the wife and children virtuous and honorable, but says that Hosea cad/ed them adulterous for parabolic purposes (so Luther, Os.).. However, this is out of keeping with his character, and might have brought upon him open ridicule abroad and misunderstanding at home.
(5) Finally, it is held that the disposition toward adultery in Gomer did not manifest itself until after her marriage (so Geb., Ma., Ros., Eich., Stuck, Theiner, Hd., Schegg, Schlier, Che., We., WRS., Kue., GAS., Da., Marti, e¢ a/.). The advantages of this view are (@) that it accepts the narrative as being the simple recital of historical facts which it apparently is, while, at the same time, it does away with the moral difficulties involved in other views that do the same; (4) that it furnishes a reasonable basis for Hosea’s evident love for his wife; (c) that it most easily explains the processes through which Hosea came to a realization of the mutual relationship of Yahweh and Israel; (d) that it is strongly supported by chap. 3, which describes Hosea as taking back his wife who had been dismissed on account of her adultery, which dismissal would not have been justifiable if Hosea had married her with full knowledge of her having been previously immoral. The objections that have been made to it (cf. Volz, Zw7h. XLI. 321-35; Da. DAZ. II. 422) are (a) the fact that it necessitates the supposition that Hosea, after an
experience running through many years, looked back upon it all, and in- P
210 HOSEA
terpreted as a direct call of Yahweh what was in a large measure due to his own natural impulses; (4) the fact that to take out of Hosea’s life the number of years necessary for the occurrence of the events nar- tated here leaves comparatively little of his life to be spent in prophetic activity; (c) if we accept the view of We. (so WRS., Kue., GAS., Now.) that Hosea did not discover his wife’s infidelity until after the birth of their first-born, it follows that his domestic experience had little to do with his conception of his mission, for he foretells the doom of Israel in the name of his first child, Jezreel; (@) however, whether he learned of his wife’s faithlessness before the birth of Jezreel (so Che. in WRS. Proph. p. 112), or after that event, and before the birth of the other two, it is scarcely probable that he would have kept Gomer in his house and permitted her to go on in adultery; (¢) the fact that the wife’s infidelity did not develop until after the marriage would have been too important an item to have been completely ignored in the text (cf. Marti’s view that Gomer’s infidelity was not discovered till after the birth of all three children); (/) it is no easier to think of Yahweh as commanding Hosea to marry a woman whom Yahweh knows to be about to break her marriage vows than it is to think of him as commanding Hosea to marry a recognized harlot; (g) the purpose of the marriage does not appear on this supposition; it was not necessary to teach Hosea the idea of Yahweh as Israel’s husband, for this was a common Semitic conception; nor could he have passed immediately from the thought of his own love for his wicked wife to that of Yahweh’s love for Israel, — he must have had a special revelation of this thought, — hence the marriage was unnecessary; nor was it necessary in order to arouse the prophetic spirit in Hosea, for he could not have seen in his own experience an analogy to Yahweh’s experience with Israel had he not previously had a prophet’s realization of Israel’s wickedness; nor is it sufficient to say that the mar- riage was to teach Hosea how deep was Yahweh’s love and anguish and how base was Israel’s ingratitude, — such sympathy could come only through clear insight into Israel’s complete revolt from Yahweh in cultus and life ; (2) while it is Zer se possible that the revelation contained in the marriage was limited to Hosea himself, the brevity of the representation and its close intermingling with the remaining utterances speak against it, as well as the fact that in such cases the mediating positior of the prophet between Yahweh and Israel always appears.
2b. For the land goes a-whoring from after Yahweh| The land represents the individual inhabitants and is used in the narrower sense of Israel, excluding Judah.* The sense of the symbol is plain: (1) the prophet represents Yahweh ; (2) Gomer who is married to the prophet, is Israel who is
 
* Wii,, Che., Now., e# ai.

married to Yahweh; (3) as Gomer after marriage goes astray, so Israel, after a period, goes a-whoring after other gods.—3. And took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim| Much fruitless effort has been spent in seeking a symbolical meaning for Gomer. This has been due to the fact that the prophet so interprets the names of the children, and because “ Gomer” is not an ordinary name; ¢g. (a@) “consumption,” and this with Diblaim = “ cor- rupt mass of figs”;* (4) “completeness” (cf. Jer. reredeo- pen), with Diblaim = “cakes of figs, sensual pleasure ” ; f (c) destruction, ruin,{ referring to the punishment coming ; (Z) coals;§ (e) marriageable maiden, daughter of wantonness. || Besides the interpretations of Bath Diblaim given above may be mentioned doppelgattige,| © which reads: “Go prophesy against the inhabitants of the city of idolatry, etc.,”’ and “ Gomer, daugh- ter of raisin-cakes,” ze. ardent worshipper of Baal.** Kimchi suggests that Gomer was a well-known harlot of the prophet’s time. But no symbolical meaning attaches to the word, since the prophet gives none, although to the others he gives it, and since the emphasis rests upon the children rather than upon the mother. In this case Gomer is a historical person,ff and Diblaim may refer to her father, or to her home, Ja¢h having both usages ; cf. Diblathaim, a city of Moab, Nu. 33% Je. 48%.— And bore him a son| Some Mss. (v.s.) omit “him”; in any case, the context demands that the son be one born in sin, though recognized for the mother’s sake. Any son born while Gomer is recognized as his wife will be his son. —4. Cal/ his name Jezreel| Four points may be noted: (1) The name is symbolical and refers to the great battle-ground (cf. Ju. 4%* 6%* 7'® 1 S, 29'™) on which Jehu had massacred the family of Ahab (2 K. 9, 10). In giving this name to the bastard son, he plainly characterizes Jehu’s act as wicked and ruinous. This opinion, differing from that of 2 K. 10”, represents the opinion of Hosea and the moral reformers of his time, a century after the event. A century had given the prophets a better point of view. The cult of Jehu and his descendants was not one which the prophet of the period could endorse. (2) Per-

haps, as Nowack suggests, the prophet had before him Elijah’s prediction of the downfall of Ahab’s home on account of Naboth’s blood (1 K. 21%*). (3) The prophet does not yet know, if we may judge from the name of the son as compared with the name of the daughter (v.°), that his wife is faithless to him.* (4) From the words that follow: J wll avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease | it appears that Hosea expected the end of Jehu’s dynasty and the end of the kingdom to come at the same time. As a matter of fact about twenty-one years (743-722 B.c.) passed before the kingdom ceased to exist, and during this period six kings sat upon the throne. This is all the more interesting in view of the fact that the prophet himself lived for some time after the death of Zechariah, and might easily have changed this definite expression which was not fulfilled to one more nearly in accord with the facts ; which goes to show that neither the prophet nor his contem- poraries were accustomed to place emphasis upon the letter of prophetic speech. While, on the other hand, it is clear from history that with the fall of Jehu’s dynasty the end in the larger sense had begun to show itself.—5. Zhe bow of Israel | 7.e. power (cf. Gn. 49” Je. 49 Jb. 29”).— Ln the valley of Jezreel | Jezreel was the scene of the slaughter of Ahab’s family by Jehu; hence the valley of Jezreel is selected as the most fitting place for the infliction of vengeance for this deed. t—6. And she bare a daughter| Now the prophet has discovered the unfaith- fulness of his wife, for he is instructed: Call her name No-pity] Literally, She ts not pitied or loved, an independent sentence used as a proper name; the explanation follows: J will no longer have pity (or love) for the house of Israel, that I should at all forgive them] Other renderings of the last clause are: (1) but will utterly take them away ;{ (2) but I will take away from them (everything) ;§ (3) but I will completely forget them ; || (4) but I will lift up my hand (in solemn oath) against them.

of Judah) This verse is from a later hand* because (1) it occa- sions an interruption in the description of the prophet’s domestic history, and its connection with Yahweh and Israel; (2) the phrase “ Yahweh their God ’’ does not occur in pre-Deuteronomic literature ; (3) other verses relating to Judah are suspicious ; (4) it reflects the deliverance of Judah in Sennacherib’s time (701 B.c.).— And will deliver them by Yahweh their God] The interpolator apparently forgets that he is representing Yahweh himself as speaking, and thus drops into the use of the third person.— And not... by bow, nor by sword, nor by equipment, nor by horses, nor by horsemen] This repudiation of all human help and this absolute confidence in Yahweh’s ability and willing- ness to deliver his people in miraculous ways represent a charac- teristically late conception (cf. Ez. 39'° Jo. 2” 34" Zc. 14°*).— 8.

§ 3. The purchase of Gomer as a slave, and her retention “many days.” 3%. The prophet was compelled by his love for Gomer, faithless as she was, to purchase her, out of the depths of infamy into which she had fallen, at the price of a slave. He does not, however, at once reéstablish the old relationship; she is to be disciplined, to lead a life shut off from men, even from her husband. This period of seclusion will last “many days.” The prophet is led to see in this also (1) a parallel of Yahweh’s treatment of Israel ; and (2) this together with the first act of the domestic tragedy constitutes his call to preach, and furnishes him the fundamental factor in his preaching.
The literary form of this section is distinctly poetic. In no portion of the book is the parallelism more marked, or more perfect. The first person is employed instead of the third, as in chap. 1. There are three strophes of 6, 6, and 5 lines, in which the trimeter movement prevails. The first (v.1) describes the faithlessness of both Gomer and Israel; the second (vs.”-8) is devoted to Gomer, picturing her degradation and seclusion; the third (v4) is devoted to Israel, picturing her degradation and seclusion. V5 is a later addition (v.z.) In this piece, which stands closely related with the contents of chap. 1, both in form and thought, the artistic element is seen in (1) the distribution of the contents into the three strophes (v.s.); (2) the regularity of the rhythm (falling to a dimeter only once, in VON mx); (3) the parallelism; (4) the use of poetical phrases like yy nan npxyp; (5) the use of rare and poetical words, like wws (v.) and pe (v.2); (6) the use of the first person throughout; (7) the assonance prevail- ing in the closing lines of each strophe, viz. the recurrence of 0»_ in lines 5 and 6 of strophe 1; of >. in lines 4-6 of strophe 2; and of x in lines 3-5 of strophe 3.

Gomer, described in chap. 1,* because (1) she is later defined as an adulteress; (2) she plays the part, in parallelism with Israel, represented by Gomer ; (3) her, of and I bought her (v2), refers to a particular woman, viz. the one described in v.1; (4) if this is another woman, why is not some reference made to the fact? (5) the introduction of two women would entirely spoil the essential thought. The only considerations for supposing this a different woman t are (1) the lack of an article with wx; but v.t.; (2) the lack of historical data concerning the treatment of the first wife, but, on any hypothesis, the account must be reck- oned meagre and defective; (3) the money of v.? is the dowry, but this is, in itself, a wrong assumption; v.27. In order to avoid the force of the evidence which chap. 3 furnishes for the prevailing interpretation, it has been argued that the chapter is from a later date, { because (1) in 1’ and in chap. 2 the marriage relation is between Yahweh and the land, but in 3! between Yahweh and the sons of Israel; Hosea might have learned to substitute /srae/ for land, but not sons of Israel; the latter involves such a weakening of the figure as is scarcely possible in the imagination of one man; (2) in 3’ the Israelites are said to have turned to “ other gods,” while elsewhere Hosea speaks only of images of Yahweh set up at local shrines which he never accredits with real existence as gods ; (3) chap. 3 represents Hosea as arriving at the thought of Yah- weh’s love for wicked Israel; if he had done so, this thought must have ruled his later utterances; but, on the contrary, no such thought appears ; the opposite feeling is rather dominant (cf. 9” 13“); (4) chap. 3 is in reality an allegorical narrative which was added to the literal account of facts in chap. 1 at a later date. It is evident that, either intentionally or otherwise, something has been omitted, viz. how Gomer came into the situation in which chap. 3 finds her. Did she abandon her husband? or, did

The text is clearly suspi- cious. The piece of silver is, as usual, the shekel (= 75 cents(?)). A homer = 10 ephahs (cf. Ez. 45") = 30 seahs = 8 bushels. A seah of barley, according to 2 K. 7'8, was worth one-half a shekel ; but this was at the close of a siege. The “lethek” (v.z.) by tradi- tion = one-half of a homer. Accepting this traditional valuation of the “lethek,”’ and rating the seah at one-third of a shekel, the price of the grain would be a second 15 shekels. The value of a slave (Ex. 21”) is 30 shekels, the sum here named. There is no good basis for ®’s bottle of wine (v.s.). —3.

prophet adds three specifications to this general statement, which throw light upon this purpose: ‘how shalt not play the harlot; thou shalt not have a husband; nor will I be to thee| This is climactic. The first specification goes without saying ; but two others follow: she may not have another husband, a thing in itself entirely proper; and, stronger yet, her own husband will grant her no intercourse, she is restrained “ from even the legitimate gratifi- cation of her natural instincts’? (Cheyne) ; she must give up her licentious life; the proper conjugal life is denied her “ many days.” Literally, how shalt not be to a man (cf. Ru. 1” Ly. 22” Nu. 307 Dt. 242, etc.), an ordinary expression for marriage. The third clause reads literally according to the present text, and also I unto you; according to the text as amended, nor will [ be unto thee (i.e. as a husband). This has been treated in many ways (v.s.): (1) “And also I shall be so unto you,” ze. he, the prophet, will have no connection with any other woman ; * (2) “And yet I am kind unto thee”; (3) “And also I, even I, shall not be unto you” (zv.s.), but the repetition of the pro- noun is not probable; (4) “And also I will go away from thee” (v.s.) ; (5) “And alsoI . . . not unto thee” (inserting 5x, 2.5.) ; (6) “And also I will be against you” ;{ (7) “And also I will not be unto thee,” the force of x being carried over from preced- ing clause ;§ (8) “ And also I will not come in unto you” COS a —4. For it is many days that the sons of Israel shall sit still | In other words, like Gomer, —like Israel; z.¢. Israel shall be put in seclusion, retention, until she shall have acquired a new spirit. As in the preceding case the time is indefinite; the discipline consists in certain deprivations ; and as before, these deprivations are distinctly designated in climactic order :— (1) Without king and without prince] The king and prince represent the rulers of the state (cf. Ex. 3° 2S. 19" 1 K. 8 20° Je. 26", also Ho. 7° 8” 13”, where king and prince occur to- gether). If they are here viewed as “lovers” with whom Israel has been faithlessly dallying, the demands of the context will be satisfied ; || and Hosea seems to regard them in 1‘ as guilty of injury to Israel. Others think this is too forced and prefer ee

to regard the words as a gloss (v.s.). (2) Without sacrifice and without pillar] For sacrifice @SY read “altar.” The conse- crated pillar * was a stone erected as an abode or sanctuary for the Deity at any place where Deity had clearly manifested its presence and power. There were ‘pillars’ at Shechem (Jos. 24”), Bethel (Gn. 28%"), Gilead (Gn. 31%*), Gilgal (Jos. 4°), Mizpah (1 S. 7”), Gibeon (2 S. 20°), En-rogel (1 K. 1°). They were a common feature of Canaanitish, Phoenician, and Arabic worship, and in early times were in good repute among the Hebrews, being a regular accompaniment of every sanctuary ; but the later legislation prohibited them as idolatrous (Dt. 12° 16” Ex. 23% 34”). A part of Jehu’s work as the champion of Yahweh was the destruction of the “ pillars’? of Baal (2 K. 10%*). Two of these sacred stones were discovered in 1900 by Professor George L. Robinson near the road up to the high place at Petra.t “ Sacri- fice” and “pillar” make a pair representing worship, or the work of the priest. (3) Without ephod and teraphim] These represented means of discovery of the divine will and were used in worship. The ephod{ was an image of the deity. This appears most plainly (1) from the account of the making of an ephod by Gideon (Ju. 8%*), for which 1700 shekels of gold were used, which was ‘set up’ (33") in Ophra and became an object of worship: (2) from the statement that the sword of Goliath was hung behind the ephod at Nob (1 S. 21°), showing that the ephod stood out from the wall and was not a garment hung on the wall; (3) from its connection with teraphim and with graven and molten images (Ju. 17°” 18% 7% ”).§ The ephod was probably

§ The phrase “to carry an ephod before me” in 1 S, 238 seems opposed to the

an image of wood or stone, covered with gold or other precious metal, — hence its name “NOX (cf. n7Bs, Is. 30”); cf. the use of the same word for the garment, or covering, of the priest (Ex. 25° 1S. 28). On the basis of this connection with the priestly ephod and of its relation to the sacred lot (1 S. 23°* 30"*) it is argued with much force that the primitive ephod was not an image, but a loin-cloth, or apron, containing pockets from which the lot was drawn.* The sanctuaries at Dan (Ju. 17 and 18) and at Nob (x S. 21° 23°) are mentioned as having ephods. The éraphim were penates, images of ancestors } (cia Sito Garis That they had human form appears plainly from the story of Michal’s ruse in substituting the teraphim for David her hus- band. ‘This, added to the fact that they were consulted for oracles (Ez. 217 Zc. 10”), are mentioned alongside of misxn and own (2 K. 23%), and were common to both Aramaeans and Hebrews (Gn. 31 **), makes it probable that they were relics of ancestor worship.{ If Schwally’s proposal to connect the word with oxen (= shades) be accepted, no doubt remains as to their original significance. They came to have a place at the sanctuaries along with the ephod. Are these things re- garded as ungodly and unauthorized ; has the use of them been idolatry, parallel with Gomer’s adultery ; and are these the occasion of the captivity which is now predicted? Or, as mar- riage and conjugal intercourse (something under ordinary circum- stances proper enough) were denied to Gomer for a certain period as a punishment for her sins, are these something which under ordinary circumstances are proper enough, but which in this case are taken away from Israel in order to punish her? Or does the prophet’s thought include both Yahweh-worship and idol-worship? That is: in the same manner as Hosea’s wife is to be restrained from all intercourse, both lawful and unlawful, so Israel is to be cut off from all worship, both true

and false.* Much turns on the answer given to these questions. If the first is true, Hosea, looking at the case from the point of view of Judah, regards the Northern kings as usurpers, and the sacrifice and pillars as alien to the orthodox cult and as the source of Israel’s difficulties.t If the second is true, he regards these things as legitimate and natural; he enters no protest against them, just as he enters no protest against mar- riage ; but for this very reason, the deprivation is all the more severe, since it is to be a deprivation of what was legitimate and not of what was illegitimate.{ In this case, as Wellhausen says, “It is not without a touch of scorn that Hosea here with an air of innocence enumerates macceba, ephod, and teraphim as something which will be sorrowfully dispensed with in exile.” —5.

It is a picture of the very “last times.” — And David their king| This, interpreted from the point of view of the Judaistic period, is not (1) merely a king of the Davidic dynasty, z.e. the dynasty itself (cf. Am. 9") ;§ but (2) the Mes- sianic king, || the second David, an idea which had its roots in Isaiah’s time, and thenceforward developed (cf.

In short the people were to be without God and his worship, but also without Baal and his worship. But the use of the ephod was as truly an act of superstition as was that of the teraphim.

§ 4. Israel’s harlotry and her punishment therefor. 2*” 10-14. 15 (18). 19 [ English, 2?°- 8-12. 13 (16), eg Es
Let Israel put away her harlotry, lest I destroy her ; for she has sinned shamefully in entering into union with those whom she supposed to be the authors of her prosperity; and she has for- gotten that it was I who gave her all these things. But I will take away my corn and wine and wool and flax; I will destroy her vines and fruit trees; yea, I will cause all her gladness to cease ; I will punish her for her indulgence in unholy things. I will even cause these things to be forgotten.
This is (1) independent of chaps. 1 and 3, which go to- gether; and (2) independent of the insertions from later times in vs.® ® 16: 17. 20-22. 2-25.18" There is no very close connection between this and chaps. 1 and 3.
This piece may be treated as a literary unit (vs.4% 61 being regarded as glosses; v.d.). Its thought is the simplest possible: /srael has played the harlot; she shall be punished. For the passages which have been inserted by later writers (four such insertions may be distinguished), v2. It is made up of four strophes, 8, 9, 8, 9; and its movement is trimeter. This is almost perfect throughout. Strophe 1 (vs.4%): Plead with your mother to put away her sin, lest I destroy her. Strophe 2 (vs.7-): She has sinned in seeking the Baalim from whom she imagined she received benefit, not knowing that it was I who bestowed upon her all her comforts. Strophe 3 (vs.1)1*): Therefore I will take back these things which I have given her, the evidences of her prosperity, her corn and wine, her vines and fig trees. Strophe 4 (vs.3-18.19); I will cause all joy to cease and will punish -her for these indulgences, and their very names shall be expunged and forgotten. In this treatment the following modifications of the present text have been made: (1) 28 9 16. 17, 20-22, 28-25, 1-8 are taken as four distinct and independent utter- ances and treated separately (see pp. 236-248); (2) 24% (nw... >), v8, v.20 (Syab wy), v.12, v4 (amen vd wn2 we) are glosses; (3) v.’* is treated as a gloss; (4) v.!4 is placed after v.11, leaving v.® and ys.15and19 in close connection. These passages will be considered in their proper places.

Lest I strip her naked | Cf.-Ez. 16". In five successive and climactic phrases there is pictured the punishment which awaits the adulteress, Israel. It is still Yahweh who speaks. The representation is at first true to the figure, and speaks of Israel as a woman; but almost imperceptibly it passes over in the latter part to the thought of the land. Stripping naked the adulteress was the custom of other nations (¢.g. among the Germans |). According to Ly. 20” and Dt. 22” as interpreted by the Talmud, she was to die by strangling ; but Ez. 16"? “Cet, John 8°) refers to death by stoning. — And set her as in the day of her birth] When Israel’s history as a nation began, whether we date it from the time of the Egyptian bondage, or from the time of her becoming independent (cf.

Ez. 19 Koran 30:18).

It is the gods of the land that give these, hence they must be followed after. The word for my drink does not mean “ strong drinks,” § or artificial drinks in gen- eral;|| but, although rare, has the meaning of drink in general, as in Ps. 102°; cf. its figurative meaning in Pr. 3°, the only other occurrence of the word. In view of the reference to wavy in con- nection with Jvead, and the frequent use elsewhere of the phrase oil and wine, drink may be taken here as = wine. —10.

It is not to be taken as an interrogative sentence, but as a declarative sentence, continuing the thought of v.7.** Corn, wine, and oil represented the wealth of Palestine (Dt. 7% 11, etc.).— And multiplied her silver and gold Did Israel’s silver and gold form part of the country’s mineral resources ? Or did they come from the sale of the country’s products, such as those just mentioned? The knowledge we have of ancient mining points to the latter, since in Syria proper there were no mines for gold. The gold came from Spain, India, Arabia, and perhaps South Africa. Silver was mined in Spain and in Upper Egypt. The single passage in the O. T. which refers to mining of any kind (Jb. 28) must have been written by one who had seen mines operated in other lands.t~ However, gold and silver were used as media of trade in Palestine in the earliest times, as appears from references to them in the Tel-el-Amarna letters ; ff

III. 34 ff.) says of Hezekiah, “Along with thirteen talents of gold and eight hundred talents of silver I made him bring after me precious stones, etc.” — Which they have used for the Baal| This has been taken to mean the overlaying of images with silver and gold (cf. Is. 30”) ;* (2) the golden calves established by Jero- boam I., the clause in this case limiting only the preceding word “gold” ;¢ (3) molten images of the calf, found in the various high places; (4) gold offered to Baal.{ But in any case these words are a gloss as is shown by their loose connection (cf. the absence of the relative pronoun) ; by the use of the article with the singular of by3; by the 3d plural of the verb instead of the 3d feminine singular as in the preceding clause; and by their departure from the thought of the context which is con- cerned with Yahweh’s actions rather than with those of Israel. § —11l.

The beginning was marked by the Feast of Massoth and the close by the Feast of Ingathering. The gathering of grapes for eating began as early as June in some regions, but the vintage proper began in September and continued on into October. The vintage festival was the Feast of Booths. — And J will rescue my wool and my flax] These

which mirth was so conspicuous a feature (cf. Ju. 21% 1 K. 8? 12”).* This is the only one of the three great feasts which is named in the historical books. For a similar threat see Am. 8".— Her new moon, and her sabbaths and her festal as- semblies] The festival in connection with the first appearance of the new moon probably dates back to a very early period in Israel’s history,t as appears from the fact that it and the passover are the only feasts having no connection in origin and significance with agriculture, and that it seems to have been an occasion for clan reunions and sacrifices (1 S. 20**). It was also regarded as a fitting occasion for visiting the prophets (2 K. 4%). The ordinary occupations of life were suspended on this day as also on the Sabbaths (Am. 8’). There seems to have been connected with its celebration a large amount of superstition and corruption which was objectionable to the prophets, for Isaiah also threatens Israel with its removal (2”*), while JE and Deuteronomy completely ignore it. However, later legislation incorporated it in the regular sacrificial system (Ez: 467 Nu: 26" *) 29° 1Ch.23" 2-Ch. .2t,ete. uy Then sae- bath§ is often mentioned alongside of the new moon (Am. 8° Is. 1% 2 K. 4% Ez. 46°), and seems to have been closely con- nected with it originally, the new moon being observed on the first day of the month, and the Sabbath probably on every seventh day after. In course of time, however, the Sabbath came to have more importance than the new moon, and its recurrence on every seventh day became independent of any relation to the new moon. ‘The Sabbath was originally a day of sacrifice and of propitiation of the deity, as appears from

+ This early origin is made certain if ardybn (Ju. 9?7) be derived from bbn, to shine, and thus connected with the Arabic 42/4 = new moon. Thus the general word for feast would originally have been used only of the new moon feast. So Sprenger, Leben u, Lehre d. Mohammads, III. 527; Lag. Orientalia, Il. 19f.; Now. Arch. Il. 138f.

the regulations controlling corresponding days in Babylonia, and from O. T. references to it in earlier days as a day of religious observances (1 K. 4” Is. 1 Ez. 46'*), a day when trade ceased (Am. 8°), and when the manna was withheld (Ex. 16”), and the day upon which the showbread was renewed (1 Ch. 97), > The rest from ordinary labors which was a consequence of this effort to propitiate deity came to be in later days the most conspicu- ous feature of Sabbath observance. Two traditions exist in the O. T. concerning the origin of the day: Ex. 20" traces it back to God’s resting after his creative work (cf. Gn. 2”), while Dt. 5¥ makes it a memorial of the Exodus. Festal assemblies* is a term used to designate a sacred season or feast; literally it is an appointed time or place. It is a broader term than 3n, which is properly applied only to feasts involving pilgrimages. It is thus used of the Sabbath (Lv. 237%), the Passover (Lv. 23**), the New Moon (Ps. 104”), the Year of Release (Dt. 317), the Day of Atonement (Lv. 23”), the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Lv. 23°), and the Feast of Booths (Dt. 31” Ho. 12°). In Gn. 14 this word is used probably of the sacred seasons as determined by the moon’s changes, rather than of the seasons of the year. In Ho. 9’ it is used in a general sense in parallelism with feast of Yahweh. Thus in the terms “ feasts,” “new moons,” “ Sabbaths,” and “festal assemblies,” the prophet has included every variety of sacred feasts ; they are all to be brought to an end.—15. And J will visit upon her the days of the Baalim] i.e. 1 will punish her on account of the days, etc. Zhe days of the Baalm is an expression referring especially to the festivals just enumerated and in general to the whole period during which corrupt Yahweh- worship had prevailed, since the festivals and even the entire cultus, though nominally carried on in honor of Yahweh, were in reality, from the prophet’s point of view, corrupt rites and sensual orgies devoted to the Baalim.t—Jn which she made offering to them] For this interpretation of “wp v2.

and sacred occasions. The clothes worn in the performance of everyday duties must be either laid aside or thoroughly washed, lest they should defile the sanctuary ; while clothes made holy by contact with holy things could not be worn afterwards in ordinary life, unless they were previously washed, since they would render holy, #.¢. taboo, everything touched by them. Jewels, too, seem to have been a usual feature of the sacred dress; the Syriac word for “earring” means “the holy thing,” and the word for “pearls” in the dialect of South Arabia seems to denote the same idea. Moreover, jewels were common as amu- lets.* — And went after her lovers, and forgot me| The nature of their Yahweh-worship was such as to give them an entirely false idea of the character of Yahweh; under his name they were virtually doing homage to the Baalim. — 18. And tt shall be at that day| A very common form for introducing a gloss. The reasons for regarding this as a gloss { to v.® are (1) the use of the terms /sh¢ and Baad, (2) the fact that it is in part a repetition of the thought of v.", (3) its metre differs from that of both preceding and following context, (4) it is superfluous in the strophic structure.— Zhou shalt call me Ishi] te. my husband ; this implies Israel’s return to a proper understanding of her relation to Yahweh and of the kind of service acceptable to him, —a thought which lies beyond Hosea’s outlook for his people. It gives the positive aspect of Israel’s future conduct, which is represented only negatively in the next clause and in v2, And shalt call me no more Baal’] i.e. my Baal; Hosea regularly uses the plural form Baalim when speaking of Canaan- itish elements in the Yahweh-worship ; the singular occurs only here and in the gloss to v.%. The two words Ishi and Baak express practically the same idea, but the use of the latter is condemned on account of its connection with the Baalim.— 19. And I will remove the names of the Baalim from her mouth| Cf. Zc. 13’, This verse connects closely with v.¥.

A. Israel, compelled to separate herself from her lovers, returns to Yahweh; 2° Israel finds herself cut off from her lovers by impassable barriers ; she searches for them, but they have disap- peared, together with the prosperity which she had associated with them; she returns therefore to her former husband.
This is a single strophe of six tetrameters, or two strophes, each of three tetrameters. The measure is rough and irregular. These verses do not come from Hosea himself (so Now., Volz; Oort, 747. XXIV., 345 ff., regards ys.8-10 as misplaced, and inserts them between 215 and 216; Marti om. only %) because: (1) they break the otherwise close connection between vs.7 #7410; (2) they do not harmonize with 33, since here a voluntary return of the woman is described while there she is held in forcible restraint; (3) they are rendered superfluous by 3%; (4) they prematurely introduce the element of chastisement which comes in naturally in vil; (5) the rhythm and strophic structure differ from those found in the context.

Therefore] The later writer builds this insertion upon the thought of v.’: Because now Israel has expected her food and clothing from her lovers, therefore, — Behold, I am going to hedge up her way with thorns| As if Israel were a traveller and, as such, finds in the course of her journey a thorn-hedge directly in front of her, which proves to be impassable ; cf. Jb. 3%. “It is very common in the East to put thorns and the branches of thorn trees along the sides of fields by which sheep are driven to pas-

ture, so that they may not wander in.” * — And build her a wall that she may not find her paths| If the path comes suddenly up to a wall, and she cannot proceed further, it is evident that the path beyond the wall cannot be found. This wall, as well as the thorn-hedge, represents circumstances and events which render continued action of any kind impracticable, “ some dark calamity utterly paralyzing the vital powers.” t{—9. And she will pursue her lovers and not overtake them] i.e. the blessings upon which she confidently counted as coming from the Baalim will fail her, and as a consequence she will no longer feel their “ mystic pres- ence.” 7 is intensive, and represents the pursuit as earnest and eager.— ... Seek and not find them] For a similar use of wpa, cf. 5° 2 Ch. 11%.— Let me go and return unto my former husband | This implies a feeling that in an earlier period there was something, at all events, different. This earlier religion stood out distinctly in contrast with the later religion which now included contaminating elements from the Canaanitish cults. It was this primitive, severe, and unimaginative religion which Elijah repre- sented, and which was still observed by such as Jonadab the Rechabite (Je. 35°") and his comrades. — For it was better with me then than now| An expression of opinion on the part of one who has seen in Israel’s later history the facts which seem to him to prove this statement. It was not an idea that could have been clearly comprehended in Hosea’s times. The reference is to Israel’s earliest times, before she had become tangled up with Canaanitish civilization. { This is no genuine repentance (cf. 6**), but only a desire for change, because change is expected to bring relief (cf. Je. 44”).

B. Israel, after a season of separation from her lovers, will be restored to former favor; 2*™, Israel is kindly and gently separated from her lovers, and, as in the coming out of Egypt, is guided to the wilderness for discipline ; after this her possessions will be given back to her, and she will again be strong and fresh as in the days of her youth.
This, like the former addition, consists of one strophe of six tetrameters. It differs from 28-9 (1) in the different usage of min, cf. 1937 (2%) with m0 sax (216); (2) especially in the entirely different point of view, 28.9 repre- senting Israel as forced away from her lovers, 21" as enticed away; 28.9 representing the discipline as coming in one way, 216.17 as coming in another. This piece is clearly late (so Volz, Now., Marti; cf. Now.’s later views, (1) in Die Zukunftshoffnungen Israels in der Assyr. Lert (1902), p. 43, that these verses belong to a late utterance of Hosea; (2) in Now.? (1903) that they are not from Hosea, and in any case belong in another connection) because of: (1) the different point of view taken from that in ys.li ff; there the thought is that of punishment pure and simple, here it is tender-hearted chastisement with a view to repentance and reformation; there punishment only is in mind, here promises of blessing prevail; (2) the different repre- sentation here from that in v.5; there the land where Israel dwells is to become a barren waste; here Israel is to be driven from its land into the desert by Yahweh; (3) the thought of Israel’s obedience to Yahweh in her youth (v.17), which does not agree with the representations of 111f and 124; (4) the order of thought in v.!’, which is characteristic of later days; Israel’s return to Yahweh is here represented as due to Yahweh’s generous bestowal of blessings which awaken gratitude, but if Hosea ever contemplated a return it must have been as a result of punitive discipline at the hands of Yahweh, blessings coming only after repentance; (5) late expressions; eg. “ the valley of Achor” is mentioned in Is. 651°; the figure of allurement in the wilder- ness has parallels in Ez.; (6) the different rhythm and strophic structure from those employed in the genuine verses of the context.

There is no need for the emen- dations of Oettli and Halévy (v.s.), though they furnish a smoother connection, viz. “ And I will make the valley of Achor, etc.” — And there she shall respond as in the days of her youth| Israel, once more, will now yield herself to Yahweh’s will, make response to his advances, conform herself to his wishes ;}{ cf. 2!” This is better than (1) she wil/ sing, §§ the reference being to antiphonal singing like that of Miriam (Ex. 15°”), for such singing here and in vs.2-% would be out of place, (2) she will humble hersedf, |\\| or (3) she will go up thither, which certainly goes well with the 7_ of mw, but is not consistent with the identification of Amw with nw», and anticipates the smbv of the following line. — And as in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt | The memory

We have here two somewhat ragged pentameter strophes of four lines each. This, like 4 and B, is independent of the chapter as a whole, as well as of the other divisions. It is peculiar in: (1) its rhythmic structure, (2) its repetitiousness and prolixity, (3) its point of view. It is to be regarded as distinct from the chapter as a whole (so Volz, Now.; Marti, 72.2122) because: (1) this idyllic picture of a state of universal peace represents later ideals (cf. Is. 48* 6575); (2) the thought of vs.1# has no parallel in the story of Hosea’s marriage, which is the basis of chaps. 1-3; (3) the vocabulary and phraseology of v.29 are characteristic of a later age; cf. Gn. 9? Lv. 269% Ez. 34% Is. 116 # 359 24 Zc. g!9; (4) a new metre and strophic structure appear. Now., in his Zukunfishoffnungen Israels in der Assyr. Zeit, p. 43, withdraws his earlier view that vs.2~ are from another hand, and suggests that they come from a late utterance of Hosea; in Now.?, however, the Hoseanic authorship of yv.?° is once more abandoned.

20. And I will make for them a covenant with the beasts, etc.| The pronoun refers to Israel; and, now, between Israel and the lower world of animals a covenant will be established, the essence of which will be peace between man and animals. Just sucha covenant restraining the beasts from harming Israelites, Zc. 11” represents Yahweh as breaking; cf. also Ez. 34”. Such a cove- nant was rather an “ordinance” than a “treaty” (Cheyne). Is there here and in prophetic references to close relationship of animals and men (cf. Nu.-227 Is. 11°° 65” Jb. 5”* Gn. 31* Ez. 34”) a survival of the totemistic conception involving a belief in a real blood connection? * — And the bow and the sword and war I will break out of the land | There will be peace likewise between Israel and other nations (Ps. 46° 76° Je. 49” Is. 94). War (cf. 1’), including everything that relates to battle, is here joined with dreak by zeugma.t This late expression finds analogies in Is. 2* Mi. 4* Je. 23° 33% — And J will make them le down in safety.—21. Yea, I will betroth thee to me forever] Security and confidence are the great ends sought in the administration of the affairs of a nation. Zo ke down in safety (cf. Jb. 11 Is. 14 Ly. 26°) is the naive and childlike designation of complete assur- ance. But, in order to strengthen the thought and to bring it into harmony with the context, the writer goes back to the figure of betrothal and marriage, a relationship which, now, shall last throughout all time (cf. Je. 31°” Is. 54°"). — In kindness and in mercy| The preceding words, in righteousness and in judgment, are to be omitted as a gloss (v.s.), since they are superfluous by the side of v.”; are inapplicable in the strictest sense to the figure of betrothal; present, as they stand, a bizarre arrangement of thought; interfere with a smooth strophic structure; and ex-

press the thought of a later period. For the manifestation of kindness and mercy on the part of God to Israel, cf. Is. 141 30% 49° 54°" Je. 31% Ez. 39%.—22. J will betroth thee to me in Jaithfulness, and thou shalt know Yahweh] The thrice-repeated statement of betrothal makes it both emphatic and solemn. Fazth- Julness from the time of Isaiah (cf. Is. 11°) had been one of the characteristics of Yahweh most frequently dwelt upon in his rela- tion to man. Three gifts will thus be brought to Israel as bridal gifts, viz. love, mercy, and faithfulness, and as a result Israel w7// know Yahweh (cf. 4'). The custom originally was to pay the dowry to the bride’s family (cf. Gn. 34”) as a compensation for the loss of her labor ; later this dowry came to be regarded as the possession of the wife (cf. Gn. 31”) which provided for her needs in case of her husband’s death, or her divorce without due cause.* The fact that the gifts of Yahweh here are all such as would tend to the happiness of Israel makes it evident that the later marriage custom is alluded to.t Everything is given by Yahweh, and nothing is asked of Israel in return.

D. Yahweh's response in faithful love; 2°**.—“Jezreel (Is- rael) asks the plants to germinate ; they call upon the earth for its juices; the earth beseeches heaven for rain; heaven suppli- cates for the divine word which opens its stores, and Yahweh responds in faithful love.” (Cheyne).
This addition consists of three strophes of trimeter movement, of 4, 3, and 4 lines, Its characteristics as a piece are clear and beautiful thought, and perfect, artistic form, the metre being regular, the parallelism progressive, and the strophic structure symmetrical; cf. in the last line of each strophe the pronoun followed by a vb. of saying. Both thought and form are highly poetic. It is from later times than those of Hosea (so Volz; Marti omits 2150-2), as is seen from: (1) the fact that it contemplates the full restoration of Israel to Yahweh’s favor; (2) the eschatological phrase x)97 DV3 7°, which belongs to later times; (3) the use of my, which is found in this sense only in late passages, e.g. 14° Ps. 65° Ec. 1019; (4) the materialistic blessings spoken of here which are not in keeping with the spirit of the teachings of Amos and Hosea; (5) the new metre and strophic structure; (6) the presupposition of the exile contained in v.%4,

23. J will respond to the heavens] The petition from Israel for prosperity comes last of all through the heavens to Yahweh, who is the fountain head of authority. The representation is not merely poetical ; for it was the popular belief that rain and dew came as the direct gifts of Yahweh. It was at his command that the clouds were opened or remained closed; cf. Am. 9” Jo. 3% Ez. 34 47*%, also Dt. 28% Lv. 26%.— 24. And they shall re- spond to Jezreel| The corn, wine, and oil will respond to Israel, here called Jezreel with reference to the meaning of the word, God sows, cf. the use made of it in v.%.—25. And I will sow her unto me in the land | Cf. Je. 317 *. Jezreel = Israel restored, is to be sown again in the land, this time unto, z.e. for, Yahweh. All Israel, wherever scattered, will return to the land of their ancestors. The purpose of the sowing is, of course, that they may bring forth fruit.— J will have pity upon the un-pitied one| The name of 1° is here reversed.— And to not-my-people I will say,

NINA D2 (Ze. 134); DN DYDY TIN (Am. g}8); NAA Nya AM (Am. 518); yo-INN AM (Jo. 31); oxm:A ~MyaMNa mm (35 Mi. 41).—ayx] Repeated for the sake of rhetorical effect; to omit it once, as some do, spoils the rhythm of the passage, and robs it of its dignity in some measure. —07)] From this point on through v.24 the clauses are all circumstantial, depending upon v.34,
E. Israel's vast numbers, united as one family under Yahweh, and victorious against all enemies; 2**.—In the future time, Israel’s numbers will be beyond calculation; instead of estrange- ment from Yahweh, her people will be recognized as the sons of the living God; and instead of schism between north and south, there will be united action resulting in victory over all opposers.
We have here two strophes of four lines each, in the pentameter movement. Each strophe contains an important idea, and both together form a splendid unity. Strophe 1: Israel’s numbers will be great, and she will again become Yahweh’s people. Strophe 2: She will be reunited, and thus enabled to meet all enemies. This piece has been recognized as occupying an impossible place, and has been transferred to the end of chap. 2 (so Heilprin, 7he Historical Poetry of the Ancient Hebrews, Il. 125 f.; St., Kue. Z2nd. Il. 319; Che., Ké. Einl.; Gu., GAS., Oet.). The grounds urged for this are the fact that it avoids the abrupt transition from threat to promise involved in passing from 1° to 21; the better connection secured in placing 21 after the promises of 270%; and the very similar arrangement found in Rom. 9%f where these verses are quoted. But it is superfluous after 2%, being little more than a repetition of vs.25%5; it uses prxn (v.2) in an altogether different sense from that in vs.2° and 25; »ny-xb is given a different interpretation from that in v.”5; and it forms a very poor ending for chap. 2, It is better to treat it as an entirely later piece (We.; Sta. GV/.1.577; Co. ZA W. VII. 285, and Lindl. 172; Giesebrecht, Be- trage zur Jesaiakritik, 213 ff.; Oort, 727. XXIV. 358 ff.; Loft.; Che. in WRS. Proph. p. xviii; Volz, Now.; Seesemann, 33; Da. DB. II. 425; Marti, ZA. 2122; Grimm, Ziturg. Append. 61 ff.); because, in its present position, it breaks the connection, nor can it be satisfactorily placed elsewhere; the refer- ence to Judah is suspicious, the rest of the chapter speaking only of Israel; it presupposes the exile (v.?); its vision of Israel’s future passes beyond Hosea’s horizon; the tremendous increase of Israel is a later eschatological concep- tion (Gn. 22!” 3212 Is, 481%); and it differs in poetic form from every other

In its place will be given to them a title denoting the closest fellowship with him, viz. the sons of the living God], not sons of idol-gods. This phrase (cf. 1 S. 17° Dt. 5¥) includes two important elements, viz. (1) sons (cf. Nu. 21” Mal. 2") of God, in accordance with the common Semitic conception that the nation is the offspring of the deity ;§ (2) the expression “ving God, t.e. a god who is the fountain or source of life (cf. Ps. 42? 84°) ; here used for the first time (except perhaps the use by J in Jos. 3") ; cf. its later usage in oaths, Ju. 8° 1 S. 14”, placed even in the mouth of the deity, Dt. 32” Nu. 147, etc.; v. especially Am. 8%. This verse is not entirely consistent with 2”, v.s.—2.

divine approval. This schism, therefore, will be healed (cf. Is. 11% Ez. 37%).— And they shall appoint for themselves one head| This head is a king, probably of the Davidic family. — And they shall go up out of the land i.e. the land of exile (cf. Ezr. 2 7° Ne. 12}), the whole reference being to the time and circumstances of the scattering.* Some prefer to understand go up of marching to battle (cf. Na. 2? Jo. 1°), the land in this case is Palestine, now too small for the inhabitants, who therefore seek to enlarge their territory (Am. 9” Is. 11 Mi. 2%™).f Besides, it is urged, the going up from the land of captivity could not have preceded the appointment of a common king. Still others { understand Egypt to be referred to (cf. Ex. 1") and used symbolically of all captivity.

§ 6. Yahweh’s contention with Israel, on account of sins encouraged by the priests. 4°". Yahweh has a contention with Israel; for on every side is wickedness. In this wickedness the religious guides, the priests, take the lead; and for their failure to perform their duty they shall be rejected, degraded, and put to confusion. Because of their example the people of Israel indulge in idolatry and adultery. May Judah not join in iniquity with Israel, who is committed to vice, and will continue until the enemy utterly confounds and destroys her.
This piece contains five strophes of twelve lines each; the measure is trim- eter, occasionally falling into dimeter. Strophe 1 (vs.1:2%) describes the situation; Strophe 2 (vs. 1445-5) places the responsibility upon the priests; strophe 3 (vs.7- 8-9. 10.122) describes further the priest’s responsibility; strophe 4 (vs.11. 12cd. 13. 4abe) pictures the madness of the people in their sensual indul- gence; while strophe 5 (vs.15- 16.17. 18.19) depicts Israel’s sins and her conse- quent destruction. Cf. Ew., who makes four strophes, 1-610. 11-15.1619; also Wii., who divides, 1-8: #10. 11-14. 15-16; and Marti, who secures thirteen strophes of four lines each, omits vs.9-5. 64. 100.15.16, and transposes v.! to follow v.14. In the present arrangement the following transpositions have been made, viz. (1) of v.24 to precede v.'; this leaves (a) a better connection with v.10, than v.11 afforded; (4) a better connection with v.2®, than v.12¢ afforded; (c) a much easier connection for the circ. clause in #4; and (d@) no good ground for calling v.!! an interpolation (Ru., Now.), although it is proverbial in form and contents; (2) of v.!4¢ to precede }n5, the last word in v.4 as the text now stands. These words (way yar-xb oy) (2) are evidently out of place where they are, the context contrasting on (the priests) with the young women of the nation; (4) fit in perfectly with the last clause of v.4 as amended (w2.), adding still another circumstantial detail of the picture, Yea, a people, etc.; (¢) perfect the symmetry of strophe 2, while they com- pletely destroy that of strophe 4, in which they are now found; and (d@) on this supposition need no longer be regarded (Ru., Now.) as a gloss.
IV. 1 249
IV. 1-3. Zhe announcement of Yahweh's contention and its occasion. Listen, Israel, to Yahweh: The land lacks everything good; it abounds in everything bad: consequently it, with all its life, is now suffering.
In this strophe the parallelism is less regular than in the remaining strophes; but the irregularities greatly heighten the artistic effect. These consist of (1) the elegiac measure (3, 2) with which it opens; (2) the gradual abandon- ment of shorter for longer lines, until in lines 7 and 8, the climax is reached in the long series of infinitives, making tetrameters, in which the very vowels (a and 6) add to the strength of the passage (cf. the repetition of psx in the preceding line, the sound of which is well adapted to the thought); (3) the gradual falling away again of the sound in lines 9-12. The whole strophe is a magnificent example of the musical swell (crescendo and diminuendo) expressed in measure and sound.

1. Hear the word of Vahweh| This word was spoken after the death of Jeroboam II.

Hosea’s experience, as described in chaps. 1-3, sustained a relation to his prophetic work similar to that which Isaiah’s vision (chap. 6) sustained toward his ministry. { While nothing is said, the sense is evident that these words are spoken through Hosea and to Northern Israel, for in v.™ Judah is dis- tinguished from Israel.— Yahweh has a contention with| This was not merely “a just cause,” nor a reproof, accusation, § but

By ¢ru¢h he means fidelity, honesty, constancy, trustworthiness in thought, word, and deed (cf.

Gn. 21%; cf. for the use of these two words together, Gn. 32” (of God) ; Gn. 24° 47” Ps. 85" (of man)). The opposite of fidelity and love are indicated in the following verse. These elements of character and of conduct are lacking, because there is lacking also the knowledge of God in which they take root.

sake of support; they were in great numbers at many times, cf. Jenst oF ng at 22°*, and made prophecy a means of liveli- hood (Mi. 32 Am. 7”). They would perform their functions even while in a drunken condition, Is. 287.* — And by night L will destroy thy mother| Cf. 6D. Confusion has arisen between the two meanings of the verb, “to be silent,” and “ to destroy” (v.i.). Thy mother hardly means the nation (cf. 2”), for the pronoun evidently refers to the priest, and it is the priest of whom the prophet now speaks; but rather, chy stock, t t.e. a portion of the nation, the caste or clan of priests ; cf. city used in this sense (2 S. 20! Ps. 149”), with which may be contrasted “I will also forget thy children” (v.’). Indeed, Nowack so renders the phrase here, changing the text (v.s.). —6. My people will be destroyed by reason of their lack of knowledge | This sentence determines the meaning to be attached to the verb of v.°®, and also seems to favor the conclusion there reached on “thy mother,” — since now the people are dealt with as a whole. The knowledge lacking is knowledge of God (cf. v.”). The ordinary rendering wzthout knowledge utterly fails to express the sense. The reference is not to the present situation, but to the future destruction of the people because of the sins into which the priest has led them. Nowack and Wellhausen, without good reason (viz. because it is unneces- sary to the connection, and because it has no corresponding par- allel member), treat this line as a gloss. — Because thou hast rejected knowledge| It is evidently the priest who is addressed § (both on account of the preceding context, and on account of the phrase following), and not the nation ; | and besides, the idea of the nation as a priest-nation is probably late. “ Knowledge, viz. of God’s revealed will, was theoretically a deposit in the priestly order (Dt. 33 Ez. 44% Mal. 2).”—Z resect thee from being priest to me| Clearly Hosea had at one time recognized the

The priestly numbers and in- fluence have prospered and grown with the progress of the kingdom under Jeroboam II.— They have exchanged their glory Sor shame] Thus following the Syriac (v.s.), and a reading cur- rent among Jewish writers. The substitution of my (ze. God’s) glory (v.s.) is forbidden by the context, which is dealing with the priest’s degradation. For similar expressions, cf. Je. gu Ps. 106%, Their glory = their position. —8. They feed on the sin of my people] This describes more distinctly the manner of the priests’ sin. Sin (mxum) does not here mean sin-offering § (the thought being that the priests encouraged the people to sin in order that they, the priests, might have the larger num- ber of sin-offerings, z.c. greater perquisites), for four reasons: (1) the parallel word is fw, iniquity; this seems to demand for nxon the meaning siz; (2) in Hosea’s times, while compensation was given to the priests (cf. 2 K. 12"), it was not counted as an offering to Yahweh; (3) to eat the sin-offering was no sin (Lv. 6%); (4) the sin-offering was unknown prior to Ezekiel. || Nor does it mean money paid as an expiation for sin,{[ since “eat” can hardly be used with such an object. Nor may it be interpreted of the whole cultus as described in Vso" we Mor can the rendering (v.s.) “ My people shall eat sin, etc.,” be justi- fied in view of the context, which is concerned primarily with the priest. The word is to be explained therefore as sim, or with the versions sims, and is interpreted (1) by fw of the next line, (2) by 8" (cf.

consists in encouraging the people in a false conception of Yahweh, in order that they may increase their gain. — And unio their iniquity they lift their souls| They direct their greed, their longing, their appetite, to the guilt of the people; “ they live upon the vice of the day” ;* cf.

And so it becomes like people, like priest} The priest has become like, no better than, the people, his special privileges and his nearness to Yahweh now serving him no good.t It does not mean that the people have become like the priest, z.e. “they have fallen under ritual, doing from lust what the priests do from greed.” { In the latter case v.2 would mark the transition from the priests to the people, who, contaminated by the priests’ example, are corrupt and sensual; the thought here and in v. is of the people, and not of the priests. In the former case, v.? continues the de- scription of the priests’ wickedness and approaching punishment. — But I will visit punishment upon his ways, and his deeds I will requite to him| The priest shall suffer for his failure to perform aright his functions, for the conduct which has brought reproach upon his religion, and for his deeds which have been in violation of his vows. —10. And they shall eat and shall not find satisfaction] Mi. 6 Lv. 26%. This is still spoken of the priests, as even those agree who would assign the following clause to the people.§ The reference is to the sacrificial meal, in which the priest would take part with the worshipper. — Zhey shall commit adultery and shall not find satisfaction] The sin referred to here is a part of the Baal cult which the Israelitish priests have introduced into the Yahweh-service. According to this, every woman was required to prostitute herself once in the temple with a priest.|| Against the ordinary interpretation of the second clause, they shall not increase, t.e. the punishment of childlessness, is to be urged (a) the fact that increase of off- spring was not expected or desired from this immorality, (4) the @ reading (v.s.), which (cf. 1 S. 29*) means 4 find satisfaction.

Ez. 217, where the king of Babylon combines divination by arrows with consultation of the teraphim); (3) a miniature asherah, or sacred tree, the foregoing “wood” being applied to the ordinary asherah; thus the entire charge would be directed against surviving elements of tree-worship.§

The poetic form of this strophe is simple and regular. Two points only deserve notice: (1) v.!#¢4 has already been transferred to follow v.4; (2) 3 nbs aw (v.18) is probably a gloss (cf. Now.), added for toluene when the usage had died out. Such an explanation would not have been needed in Hosea’s time.

11. Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the brain] The prophet introduces the new strophe with one of the many “ wise sayings” which were familiar to him, moral sayings which consti- tuted the stock in trade of the wise men who sat in the gate. Other examples of the use of wisdom sayings may be found in gi? Ma 64? 872 to* 14%, This saying formed a most appropriate introduction to a strophe which pictures the wildest possible in- dulgence of passion. —12 c,d. For the spirit of harlotry has led them astray] They are actuated by an impulse which leads to harlotry ; cf. the use of “spirit” in this same sense with “ jeal- ousy’” (Nu. 5), “ perverseness” (Is. 19'*), “uncleanness” (Zc. 13°).* — And they have played the harlot from under their God | Cf. 1°.—18.

15-19. Though Israel is committed to idolatry may Judah not follow her example, nor resort to the places of idolatrous worship. Israel is given over to idols; she goes from bad to worse ; her rulers are enamoured of infamy. An enemy will sud- denly and violently carry her away.
If v.16 is authentic, this strophe, like the preceding one, consists of twelve lines. Here, strangely enough, as in strophe 1, the 7th and 8th lines are lengthened, as if to indicate by their very length the sadness and seriousness of the situation, The authenticity of v.15, or at least of 15a, is denied by many (so ¢.g. We.; Sta. GV/. 1. 577; Co. Einl. 172; Che. in WRS. Proph.; Gu., GAS., Now.; Seesemann, 20f.; Marti, ZB, 2122; but cf. Hal.) on the following grounds: the reference to Judah is forced and unnatural, lying aside from the prophet’s thought in the preceding and following context; the sentiment concerning Judah is radically different from that expressed elsewhere in Hosea eg. 5° 1013.14 6; and the awkwardness of the address to Israel when the thought is directly concerned with Judah; but it may perhaps be said that Judah’s affairs were always closely connected with those of Israel, and this mention would serve only to make more pointed the rebuke of Israel.

15. Although thou, Israel, play the harlot] For the reasons urged against regarding v.”? as genuine, v.s. Noteworthy is the use of the participle to express the continuance of the action. — Let not Judah become guilty| t.e. let Judah keep herself free from contact with that by which Israel has been contaminated. The admonition to Judah closes with this brief exhortation.* — Come not to Gilgal| cf. Am. 4* 5° also Ho. 12"; addressed to Israel, not Judah, { although Judah may have been prone to go to Gilgal (cf. 2 K. 8% 16% Ez. 23%). The northern Gilgal is of course in- tended (v.s., pp. 91 f.). — Wor go up to Beth-aven] Cf. Am. 4°5°1 K. 12” ; copied from Amos, § and as before an intentional pun on the name of Bethel. On “go up” with Bethel, cf. Ju. 1” 1 S. 10%. —And swear not in Beersheba, “ By the life of Vahweh”’| Cf. Am. 8%: “As thy way, O Beersheba, lives.’ The insertion of “in Beersheba” || is justified by the parallelism of the context, which demands in this line the name of a town, and by the analogy of Am. 5° 8. Swearing by Yahweh was not regarded as sinful (Je. 38°), but was permitted (Je. 4”) and, indeed, later

commanded (Dt. 6% 10”). In Am. 5° the prohibition is against coming to Beersheba for worship. It is quite certain therefore that a word designating the place has fallen out. Without this word the passage has been taken to prohibit (1) the blending of the name of the true God with those of idols (cf. Zp. 1° Ez. 20, 2 Cor. 6") ;* (2) swearing by Yahweh as a /oca/ god, cf. Am. 8%, @.+—16. Yea, like a stubborn heifer, Israel acts stubbornly Cf. 11* Je. 31% Dt. 32%. This stubborn rebelliousness is seen in Israel’s unwillingness to follow the leadings of her master Yahweh ; there is no reference, however, to the yoke of the law. { — Can Vahweh now feed them like a lamb in a broad place?| Not a declarative sentence indicating that Israel will be like a lamb in a great pasture-field, open to attack on every side and with- out proper protection, § but, altnough no interrogative particle is found, a question implying surprise. The connection with the preceding clause is close; Israel being a stubborn heifer, how can she expect to be shepherded like a lamb? The “broad place” = plenty and prosperity; cf. Ps. 18 31° 118° Is. 30%. ‘> here means yea, not du¢; and the connection with v.”, while not close, is assured. || —17. Lphraim is wedded to idols; leave him alone| The figure is that of husband and wife (cf. Mal. 2") ;{ of such a character was the “ mystic relationship” of the idolater and his God (Is. 44"; cf. 1 Cor. 10”).** The accusation here is not that of following strange gods, but of using idols to represent Yahweh, as, ¢.g. in the case of the calves and the Baalim. The latter half of the verse is a rhetorical imperative addressed to the audience ; the thought being that it is useless to try to reform Israel; he must be left to meet his well-deserved fate. —18. A band of topers! they devote themselves to harlotry | The text of vs. 8 is very difficult, perhaps hopelessly corrupt (so Nowack). This rendering is based upon a slight change of text (v.s.).

their wine.’* On the basis of fAT it will be “ their drunkenness over (7.¢. when their carousal is over) they indulge in harlotry.” f Following the example of the versions (v.s.) many have attempted to find an interpretation by changing the text (v.s.), e.g. Ruben, “he provoked the Sabaeans”’ ; Graetz, “their princes are drunken ” ; Gardner, “ they have turned aside (they have become) drunkards” ; Bachmann, “ briers and thorns” (to be taken with v.”). Neither the causative idea, viz. “they strive to lead others to idolatry” (cf. 4% 5° 2 Ch. 21") ;¢ nor the idea of threat, “ they shall commit whoredom enough,” 7.¢. will exhaust themselves in it (cf. inf. abs. in Am. 9°) § seems to have been intended ; but rather the thought that when weary of drunkenness, they plunge into licentiousness ; they go from bad to worse. — Her rulers have fallen tn love with shame] Here again the text is uncertain; the rendering adopted involves a slight change of text (cf. Ps. 88").|| “Shield,” the literal ren- dering, is used figuratively of vwlers (cf. Ps. 89° 47°). With HAT as basis, the sin mentioned was that of: (1) bribery, “the princes love (to say) give ye (a bribe for the perversion of justice), and this is a shame” ;§ or, (2) loving shame, “her princes love, they give shame,” z.¢. so love shame as to give it to others.** Of special interest are the following interpretations (v.s.): (1) @, “ they love shame rather than her pride,” z.e. Yahweh ; (2) “ their sceptres, or scales, are lighter than a grain of corn” (the first word of v.” being joined with v.™) ;+f (3) “in their gardens they love shame” ; ¢} (4) “they loved their shame ; their pride the wind carries, etc.” (the last word of v.% being read with v-®) ;§§ “on account of their gardens their faces shall blush.” |||| — 19.

Moreover, Hosea rarely uses the sign of the definite object (Now.).

§ 7. The Guilt of Priests and Princes, and their Punishment. 5\4, Israel has become defiled under the leadership of the priests and princes, who do not know Yahweh, and, therefore, have
V. 1-7 267
been faithless to him. Punishment will be inflicted; this will be twofold, viz. from without, an invading army which will lay waste the land; also, from within, corruption and anarchy with civil war ; the moth, and the lion.
This piece, consisting of four twelve-line strophes, trimeter movement, has suffered little or no change. Strophe 1 (vs.!%) indicates the responsible per- sons; strophe 2 (vs.7) describes the relation of these persons to Yahweh. Strophe 3 (vs.51) pictures the destruction as coming from without, viz. an invading army; strophe 4 (vs.l214) pictures the destruction as coming from within, viz. corruption and anarchy. The four strophes divide themselves very naturally into two groups of two each (cf. the Massoretic Perasheth, 5). Each double strophe is introduced with a phrase inviting attention, viz. Hear this (v4) and Blow the trumpet (v.*).
V. 1-7. The priests and princes, a snare to Israel (**); their ignorance of Yahweh and consequent faithlessness to him (*"). (1) The priests and princes have proven to be a snare in which Israel has been entrapped; for Israel has been led by them into harlotry, and has become unclean. (2) They are filled with the spirit of harlotry and do not understand Yahweh. They will fail to find him when they seek him; for he will have withdrawn. Alas, they have dealt treacherously with Yahweh; for they have abandoned him for another.

In this addition, the thought of the prophet begins to concern itself, as it has not before done, with the political side. A little later, this thought becomes predominant; for it is true that, after all, the king and court could control the priests. The prophet, however, does not direct the sermon especially to the court.f With this arraignment, cf. Is. 1? Mi. 1? Jo. 1.— Hear... hearken... give ear] These three verbs present a climax, the second being

more specific than the first, and the third than the second. — For for you is the judgment] Very different from Mi. 3’, “ Is it not for you to know judgment?” but all the more true because Micah’s statement holds good. The “ you”’ does not refer exclusively to the court (“ Yea, O house of the king, give ear, because to you belongs the administration of judgment”), although this would (a2) explain the "3 which is otherwise difficult, (4) suit the par- allelism, and (¢) be favored by Mi. 3’ Dt. 17.* It refers rather to all the persons addressed. Judgment, here, is not the act of judging as in Mi. 3}, but the sentence of the judge, 1 K. 3% Ps. 17’, here unfavorable, as in Is. 53° Je. 1° 4” 39°. This sentence (cf. also v.") points to the position occupied by Israel in relation to Assyria, perhaps in the reign of Menahem (cf. 2 K. 15"), and to the ultimate destruction of the Northern kingdom which was soon to follow. — A snare... anet.... (v.") a pit] This is the triple figure, borrowed from the hunter, employed to designate the entanglement into which Israel has fallen. For similar usage, cf. Am. 3° 1 S. 26” Ps, 10° 11% The rendering fz¢ rests upon a restored text (v.s.).— On Mizpah...on Tabor... of Shittim| Mizpah = Mizpah of Gilead, Ju. 10” 11°”; also = Ramoth Gilead, Jos. 20° 21% 2 K. 9'**; also = Ramath-Mizpeh, Jos. 13%, This was the place consecrated by Jacob (Gn. 31°%) ; perhaps es-Salt in Belk‘a.t Zadbor (= Jehebet Tor) was in the territory of Issachar and Zebulon (cf. Ju. 4°).—2. Shittim (cf. text above), also called nmin 5sx, was a camping-place of Moses and Joshua (Nu. 25! Jos. 2’ 3'). It was here that the affair of Baal-Peor took place. These three places were celebrated, per- haps, for the peculiarly seductive character of the worship which they represented. For other renderings of the first clause of v.’, v.t.— And there is no correction for any of them} This { is more consistent with the context than, “And I am a rebuke to all of them,” § although the latter is the more commonly accepted meaning, and, according to Wellhausen, furnishes the transition from the priests to the people, from the seducer to the seduced. —3.

Their doings do not suffer them to return to their God | This rendering,* making “doings” the subject, is preferable to the other rendering, “They do not frame their doings to return, etc.,” + which makes it the object. For one use of jn), 1 Ch. 22"; for the other, Ju. 3” 15' 1 S. 18? 247 Gn. 20°. — For the spirit of harlotry is within them] i.e. in their constitution. — And Yahweh they do not know | See 2°” 4° 6° 8°. This is the burden of Hosea’s preaching ; lack of a proper appreciation of the character of Yahweh has led Israel into all sorts of corruption.{ —5. But the pride of Israel shall tes- tify to his face| This rendering of mv § (= %», cf. st); (1) goes better with the following preposition 3; (2) suits better the con- text in 7” than the rendering zs humbled (which takes my = wy =e pac |). Zhe pride of Lsrae/ has been taken asa title of Yahweh (cf. Am. 8"), in which case it would mean that Yahweh has deliv- ered a judgment (cf. Ru. 1”) against Israel which signifies de- struction; but the context ** is dealing with Israel’s “ material grandeur” (cf. Zc. 10" Ez. 32”), z.e. arrogance; in this case it would mean: Israel’s arrogance is a testimony against Israel him- self. This arrogance (v. Wellhausen) is the trust in the ritual, and the feeling that there is no need to turn from that and to repent (cf. 7°).— And Ephraim shall stumble in his guilt] The word stumble is of frequent use among the prophets to designate dis- aster and ruin; cf. 4° 14° Is. 31° 59” Je. 50” Na. 2° 3°.— Judah also shall stumble with them| These words are suspected as a gloss by some tf without sufficient reason.

§ 8. Israel’s blind and fitful repentance does not remove the guilt which will one day be manifest to all; which, indeed, is seen to-day in the affairs of the king. 51-7, (1) Israel may put on the form of repentance, but she is so blind to the situation and to the true nature of God that such repent- ance is only on the surface. (2) This is true in spite of the fact that the most earnest teaching and the most definite warnings have been given concerning Yahweh’s will. (3) Israel is faithless, and her chief towns are headquarters of every kind of vice, and all this is encouraged by the priests. (4) But now when the time comes, z.¢. the day when “the great turning-point in her fortunes arrives, the day of mingled punishment and mercy,” * this iniquity NE DO a Adel

will be recognized and appreciated. (5) Nay, even to-day it is apparent in the situation as it stands connected with the kings — enthroned and assassinated, “ surrounded by loose and unscru-
pulous nobles : adultery, drunkenness, conspiracies, assassinations ; every man striking for himself; none appealing to God.” *
This piece contains five strophes of 12, 10, 10, 10, and 12 lines. The movement is the trimeter, but occasionally it falls into the elegiac style ; cf. Bu. ZAW.II. 32 f. This arrangement secures a complete unity of thought and shows close consecution of strophic arrangement. Strophe 1 (515-6%) pre- sents in dramatic form two soliloquies: the first, of Yahweh, who now turns himself away with the feeling that in distress Israel will seek him out ; the second, of Israel, who in shallowness of heart assures himself complacently that Yahweh has wounded him, simply that he might heal him; that as soon as he seeks Yahweh, he will fnd him. Strophe 2 (6*%) describes the in- credulity and impatience with which Yahweh receives this fitful repentance. Had he not given him warning? Had he not expressly declared that it was love which he desired, and not sacrifice? Strophe 3 (671) portrays the terrible wickedness of Israel’s chief places, the robbery and murder, the corruption and adultery which Israel, encouraged by the priests, has com- mitted in transgression of the covenant. Strophe 4 (64-7) pathetically sug- gests that in the future a time will come, the day of Israel’s turning, when the iniquity of Ephraim will be laid bare, although perhaps at present their consciences do not prick them, so entangled are they in the meshes of sin. For, in fact, strophe 5 (7°), the immorality of the nation, from king down, is so apparent, the hopelessness of the situation is so great, that repentance is really impossible, the very capacity for it being absent. In this arrange- ment the following points deserve consideration: In strophe 1, line 8 seems exceedingly long, especially in contrast with line 7, which is unusually short. It is possible that w259 m2 is a gloss explaining opr. With this ex- ception the parallelism is close and regular. In strophe 2 line seems to be missing after 6*, the p-by of 65 failing to connect properly with what pre- cedes, This fact, pointed out by Now., accords with the need of a line to complete the otherwise almost perfect parallelism of the strophe. It is worth while to suggest that perhaps the line x¥» ND WELD) (as reconstructed) was originally joined with the line now lost. It is surely not closely con- nected with the two preceding lines. In this case the strophe would be ideally symmetrical. In strophe 3 (671), (1) the form of the elegy appears quite distinctly; (2) lines 1 and 2, and 3 and 4 are satisfactory; line 5 might be read assassins in troops, a gang of priests, but cf. p. 287; (3) 1™ of line 7 is probably wrong, for it is impossible to separate it thus from 72; (4) perhaps line 8 might be transferred to follow what is now line 9, thus

improving the sense and as well the measure; (5) 64 is, of course, a gloss. In strophe 4 (64-72), (1) v.12 is suspected, but v7. ; (2) v.1° is clearly to be connected with what follows in spite of the chapter division. In strophe 5 (7°*), (1) v.4 from “3n wo is a gloss explaining v.6; (2) the remainder of the strophe is regular and symmetrical.
V. 15-VI. 3. Lsrael feigns repentance. Ina wonderfully con- ceived pair of soliloquies, the poet represents Yahweh as waiting for Israel to come back, and Israel as, in fact, coming back, but with a conception of Yahweh so false and an idea of re- pentance so inadequate as to make the whole action a farce.
The genuineness of 5%?_63 is denied by some (Che. in WRS. Profh. xx ff.; Marti, Volz, /ahweprophetie, 33; Grimm, Ziv. App. 69 ff.; Che. in- cludes also ¥ and 64 in the insertion, and Marti 2 and 6° >) on the ground that: (1) it breaks the close connection existing between 514 and 64; (2) its phraseology is an echo, in part, of the following verses; (3) the interpretation of 6*% as an expression of superficial repentance, which interpretation is necessary to the retention of these verses in the text, is forced; (4) it bears close resemblance in spirit to other late insertions, eg. 14) and 611-71; (5) the exile seems to be presupposed by the strong expressions sn) and wpp», 6?; (6) the language supports the argument for a late date (Volz cites the following terms: on? 1x3; "nw; HAW =tear; AMT with > in fig, sense only here; w psn; ann).

15. J will return again to my place| Yahweh is soliloquizing. This is not the figure of the lion returning to his den ;* but (cf. Mi. 1°) is a survival of the older form of expression in accordance with which interest in human affairs is expressed by the phrase “coming down.” The f/ace is the heavenly temple ; to this he _ will return, and, as it were, from a distance observe the conduct of Israel (Is. 18 Ps. 14”).t The expression, as a whole, indicates Yahweh’s non-activity in Israel’s fate ¢ (cf. 9” Je. 14°° Ps. 80"), and is parallel with the common expressions, “ hide the face” (cf. Ps. 10 307 104”),§ and “stand afar off” (cf. Ps. 10! 38").— Until they are confounded] This rendering, involving a slight textual change, is easier || (cf. Ez. 6° Zc. 11° G, Jo. 1’) than the usual one, based upon fT, which is rendered: (1) acknowledge their offence, or feel their guilt ** (cf. Lv. 5*° Zc. 11°) ; (2) suffer the consequences of their guilt; (cf Ps. 342 Ten24oe Pr gOe Ho. 13%).— Ln their distress| Cf.

These words (vs) are not: (1) an example of the confession of penitence with which Israel will approach Yahweh in the future, employed by Hosea as an occasion for warning Israel that Yahweh’s favor will not manifest itself, as they expect, immediately upon their turning to him;4 nor (2) the words of Hosea himself expressing his desire to lead his people back to the right way, which will bring them divine favor again ;*** nor (3) the language of the prophet

Is.17°; this is syntactically correct, and gives a better parallel- ism. ‘The thought is, he will deliver us in a short time. For this use of “revive,” in the sense of healing the sick, cf. Jos. 5° 2 K. 8° 20’. This passage is really the basis of Ez. 37..§ Cf.

rogative is really a negative: J can make nothing of you.* There is no allusion to a method for bringing about the good men- tioned in the preceding verse,t nor to punishment in addition to that which they have already received. t — Since your love is like the morning cloud | Not (1) the love of God for you will be quickening, etc.;§ nor (2) the love of God for you which will be transient || like yours for him; but (3) your love for God, your goodness, your piety, is fleeting, transient. The morning clouds disappear very early during the hot season in Palestine, the sky being usually perfectly clear by 9 a.m.** — Vea, like the dew which early goes away| The dew of Palestine is very heavy in the summer time and resembles a fine rain or Scotch mist rather than the phenomenon so familiar to us.tf It is thus of the greatest importance for vegetation during the long dry season, and is a favorite illustration with O.

for disobedience; and every kind of calamity was interpreted as from God for failure to comply with his wishes. The words of Yahweh, because of their power, are compared with arrows, Ps. 45°, and with a sword, Ps. 45° Heb. 4” Rev. 16 s\icf.salso Is. 11! Je. 23%.— And my judgment is like the light which goes forth| This is based on a slight change of fH (v.s.). The judg- ment is that of which the execution now hangs over Israel. This judgment is like the light which all may see and fear, the rise of the sun being a symbol of gracious visitation.* The older rendering, “thy judgments are like a light that goeth forth,” was interpreted in various ways, ¢.g. thy way of living religiously was plain as the light ;} the judgments belonging to thee went forth like the lightning; { the judgment upon thee when it comes will be just, clear.§ Notice should be taken of the ren- dering, “my law (or judgment) shall go forth as the light.” || It is better, however, to regard the clause as circumstantial and dependent upon the preceding perfects (v.i.). —6. For it is love that I delight in, and not sacrifice\ The mistake of the people consisted in their notion that sacrifices were sufficient to gain Yahweh’s favor. What Yahweh delights in, 7.e. that which will gain his favor, is love ; cf. 1 S. 15”, in which obedience is em- phasized. This love is not love for God as distinguished from love for one’s fellow-men, but both. — Knowledge of God and not burnt-offerings| Here, as in many places in this piece, we have an example of Hosea’s ability to make a perfect parallelism.

Yahweh,* doing the same for Judah; or is the verb to be treated as impersonal — one has set for thee, etc.? t+ It is better to read mw (v.s.; cf. Ps. 104”), the passive participle. Judah, adds the reader, will also suffer disaster ¢ (cf. 8’ 10’; also Is. 17% 28%” Je. 51”) just as Ephraim, for has she not committed the same sins? Unsatisfactory is the meaning dranch (cf. Jb. 4° 18° 291°) = it has grafted a branch (i.e. of the impurity mentioned in v.”) ; § and entirely aside is the idea that the harvest is to be taken in a good sense, viz. blessing, deliverance. || —When 7 would turn the captivity (or fortune) of my people| See Am. 9'*. The grounds for treating this phrase as a gloss are by no means so clear (v.s.) in this passage as in some others; and while, in general, the clause may be taken as post-exilic, something may be said for its pre- exilic authorship here, especially if the more general of the two interpretations is adopted. The reference is not to an actual return from captivity, nor merely to the bringing of the people back to God,** but rather to the coming of a time of blessing or good fortune.ff It is therefore in any case parallel with the first clause in 7! and to be taken with it. {{— VII. 1.

"M8713, when I look at) to adapt it to the apodosis ; the former suggestion is the more satisfactory. Perhaps this line read like this, “my hope and desire is frustrated.” — For the guilt of Ephraim discovers ttself| Something (v.s.) has been lost with which the * of 45: was connected.

Jn their wickedness they anoint kings] According to fAT the charge made is that the highest authorities, the royal per- sonages, indulge in the most sensual pleasures;* or that the king is rejoiced by the violence practised and boasted of (cf. Is. 3° Pr. 20%**) by his subjects.f It is better, however, to read (cf. 8") anoint (v.s.); the thought then is that one king after another comes to the throne through acts of wickedness and crime.— And in their treacheries, princes| Secret intrigue, in- volving faithlessness to both fellow-man and God.—4. Since they are all adulterers viz. king, princes, and people. These words belong with the preceding verse as a circumstantial clause. { For Oort’s reading, v.s.— They are like a burning oven whose baker | These words, with the remainder of v.‘, are a gloss to v.°.§ This is the beginning of a new sentence, and this distri- bution of letters (v.s.) avoids the serious difficulty of treating un as feminine. — Ceased to stir up the flame] Using “3% for ‘yi. || — From the kneading of the dough until its leavening] i.e. during the period in which fermentation was taking place.
Much variation has arisen in the interpretation of details: eg. Ew., as the baker rests from heating only a short time, 7.2. while he is compelled so to do (viz. during the few hours which intervene between the kneading of the dough and its fermentation), so the rulers rest from inflaming their passions only while they recuperate their strength for new pleasures (so Ras., Hd., Pu.). Others understand that the greatest heat of the oven is from the kneading of the dough to its leavening, because refuse, not wood, is used for fuel, and some hours are needed to secure the greatest heat, and that to the heat of this period is compared their passion (Ki., Cal., Dathe, Bauer, Ros., Wii., Schm.). Some desire to allegorize the statement by making Israel the dough, the king the baker (cf. Geb., Hi.); others think that actual persons and events are

referred to, but that these are now unknown to us (Reuss). Some make the fire represent lust, while the oven is the heart; thus: “The baker ceases from kindling when the oven has reached a certain heat, and then he leaves the fire to smoulder, till the fermentation of the dough is complete, and a fresh heating is necessary. So after passion has once been gratified, it smoulders for a time, but is afterward kindled to a greater heat than before, when some attractive object comes within its range” (Che.; so Now.).

Wellhausen considers this a reference to the con- spiracy which resulted in the death of the last king (or perhaps the last 4gi#zmate king). The occasion for the murder was a ban- quet given by the king to his princes, and the conspirators were, not these same princes, but some unmentioned individuals. — 6. For like an oven their hearts burn with thetr intriguing| This translation (reading "v3 on basis of @ for 1575p) furnishes an ex- cellent sense ; something which cannot be said of #€@, for which there have been proposed several interpretations (e.g. they prepare beforehand, ¢ bring near their heart to evil works, § turn, || make nearly like,{ have made ready ;** they draw near, like an oven is their heart, etc. ; tf they draw near together, z.e. king and scoff- ers;{{ they have brought their heart into their ambush as into the oven, cf.

The night is the time for development; in the morning it becomes public. There seems to be no basis for the attempts of many commentators to connect this language with specific classes or events ; 79 the reference is rather to the many conspiracies and murders following Jeroboam II.**** — A// night their anger sleeps | With o75X, or OBS, instead of n7BK (v.s.).

All of them glowing like an oven] This is either an unnecessary repetition from v4, or if v.4 (beginning with 495) * is a gloss (v.s.), it resumes in a single line the thought expressed figuratively in v.5, preparatory to the presentation of the same thought in literal form. The order of words shows that this clause is subordinate ; it expresses the occasion of the actions next described. ‘The entire people are represented as filled with the passion of conspiracy, and consequently — chey devour their rulers | It will be remembered that the reigns of Zechariah, Shallum, Men- ahem, Pekahiah were respectively six months, one month, six years, one year. These were followed by Pekah (six years) and Hoshea (eight years). In the period of about twenty years six kings sat on the throne; cf. 2 K. 15.f The term D'DAY, commonly ren- dered judges, here means riders, z.e. the nobles, including kings and princes. It is frequently applied to kings, cf. Is. 40°: saan — All their kings have fallen] A poetic parallel for the preceding line. Some fell by assassination, others by the hand of a foreign enemy. This statement could not have been written earlier than Menahem’s time. — Vo one among them calling jor me| A circum- stantial clause added to give a prophetic touch to the historical statement which preceded. Notwithstanding the serious situation (“four regicides within forty years”) none among the people { (cf. vs. 16), rather than the princes, § call on Yahweh for help.

§ 9. The confusion of the nation. 788%. Israel is losing herself among the nations, and yet she is blind to the fact. In her arrogance she is turning away from her God, thus chal- lenging his punishment. Israel is a silly dove turning hither and thither, only to be caught in the net; 7%. Destruction awaits her; for against me, though ready to redeem her, she has lied. Instead of sincere worship, her people merely howl for corn and wine, and cut themselves and rebel. They desire evil; they are a deceitful bow; their princes shall perish i 7s | Assyria is about to attack them; they may cry unto me, but it will not avail, for they have spurned the good; 8".
In this piece we may note: (1) a change of measure, the lines containing, for the most part, four words instead of three; (2) a remarkable use of parallelism, the entire piece falling into couplets; (3) an apparent grouping of these couplets in pairs; (4) a division into three strophes, the first having three such pairs of couplets, z.c. twelve lines; the second the same; while the third, which forms the climax to the whole piece, contains one such pair, or four lines; (5) a more conspicuous effort than has heretofore been noted to introduce those points which conduce to symmetry. In the arrangement here proposed the following modifications of the text are adopted: (1) the clause onsy> yows oon in 12¢ is transferred to follow immediately upon y.29, (2) It is understood that the line now consisting of D1 »2)N) (v.13¢) is incomplete, two words being lost. (3) The words nayb w (716) are treated as a gloss. (4) The two clauses forming the second half of 8}, beginning 3)», are treated as a later interpolation.

8. Ephraim — among the nations he lets himself be mixed] On 551m, v.2.; although somewhat uncertain,* it may be ac- cepted as a fairly satisfactory reading. The meaning is not ts kneaded,f referring to the loss of independent existence in exile ; nor does it refer to the seeking for help from the outside nations ;{ but rather to the acceptance of the foreign fashions and ideas which came in upon Israel in connection with the opening up of commercial relations with the outer world.§ This is the third or fourth time in Israel’s history when the nation is brought into intimate relations with the outside world. From the association with Assyria, much good will come ; for a new and larger horizon will be secured and important steps forward will be taken toward higher conceptions of God and of the world: but with this good, there is coming also much that is bad, much that can “dissipate and confuse” the weaker of the nation. “The tides of a lavish commerce scattered abroad the faculties of the people, and swept back upon their life alien fashions and tempers, to subdue which there was neither native strength nor definiteness of national purpose.” || — Ephraim — he has become a cake not turned] As a result of mingling with the foreign nations and accepting their ideas, Israel has become an unturned cake — the round, flat cake, baked on hot stones J (cf. x K. 19°) —a striking figure, which describes the condition of things at home as growing out of that abroad. The point of emphasis does not rest on the fate of the unturned cake, which, of course, is destroyed; nor on the fact that, such a cake being half-ruined, Israel, likewise, is half-ruined; ** nor on any specific reference to their opinions concerning the worship of idols ; t+ but rather upon that weakness of the national character which SSMS

was exhibited, in the inconsistencies of which they were guilty, the lack of thoroughness with which their plans were executed, the wrong direction pursued by those in charge of the national policy, and the lack of proportion in national effort. “ How better describe a half-fed people, a half-cultured society, a half- lived religion, a half-hearted policy, than by a half-baked scone?” * —9. Strangers have devoured his strength and he knows tt not | The strangers are the foreign nations already mentioned. The reference is a general one, taking in all with whom Israel had come in contact in these times, viz. the kings of Syria, Hazael, and Benhadad in the times of Jehoahaz (2 K. 8” 10” 13’) ; Tiglath- pileser, the king of Assyria, called Pul (2 K. 15%), who exacted tribute from Menahem, and took away territory from Pekah (2 K. 15”); and likewise the Philistines (Is. 9"), and Egypt, with whom Israel was always warring. For other cases of m3, strength, used in the sense of property, cf. Pr. cage LOHR gil oa iP (cf. Is. 1°) = he does not understand the meaning of the punish- ment (27 5"); rather than, he does not understand anything, i.e. has not come to discretion, or does not know Yahweh. { — Yea, gray hairs are sprinkled upon him and he knows it not | Cf. 7" Is. 46* Ps. 71°. The nation is represented as passing through the various stages of human life. Israel has lost his strength; but that is not all, he has reached such an old age, as is seen from the appearance here and there of gray hairs, that there is no hope of regaining the strength which has been lost. The inevitable accompaniment of old age is weakness. This representation of the state as an individual, called personi- fication, is one of the most interesting features of Hebrew style; cf. the suffering servant of Is. 42™® 44'* 52¥%-53™, and the col- lective “I” of the Psalter. —10. Zhe pride (or arrogance) of Israel has witnessed against him| See on 5°; cf. Am. 4°”.

Assyria’s favor, and again, that of Egypt.* — Ver they do not return to Yahweh their God and seek him for all this| Cf. Is. 97, The logical relationship of the verbs in this verse is somewhat obscure on account of the use of the tenses.t Some treat the three clauses as coordinate ;{ others § make my the predicate not only of ” 7x2 but also of the two following clauses, trans- lating: Zhen testifies against him the pride of Israel and that they do not return to Yahweh, etc.; but this construction is cum- bersome and unnecessary ; for this use of my, v.z.—12c. J will chastise them by the abundance of their afflictions| This trans- lation (reading onax5 vsws (v.s.)) is one of several attempts (v.s.) to get a tolerable meaning out of the clause. f€@ as their con- gregation has heard, if accepted, would mean in a general sense, as has been publicly proclaimed, either through the prophets (cf. Am. 2"* 2 K. 17”),|| or if the passage is late, through the reading of the law (Dt. 27 and 28).§ Of considerable interest is the interpretation of Rashi, who without noticing the anach- ronism understands this of Jeremiah (37° 42° 30°) ; that of Hitzig, who reads: according to what is heard of (= concerning) their congregation, t.e. the Assyrian party which (note 155") relied especially on the foreign power; and that of Ewald, who inter- prets: like a prophetic oracle prophesying this very thing an- nounced to their congregation by a former prophet. But with © most commentators have found this peculiarly difficult, only B and ’A. supporting it. For the reading proposed, Ps. 164 Jb. 14" 10” furnish analogies. This clause is detached from v.”° and placed here because (1) it is superfluous in v.¥, the thought of punishment being there already fully expressed ; more- over, this prosaic statement is not in keeping with the figurative language of vs."-”; (2) it furnishes just the required conclusion for the thought of v..—11.

This ex- plains the presence of "538 in the principal clause, although it is not especially emphatic. There had been frequent instances of redemption in the past, but these do not bear upon the present situation. — When they have spoken les about me] i.e. represent me wrongly, misunderstand me, and think evil of me; meaning by this not simply that they were acting as hypocrites in their worship,§ nor that they thought Yahweh unable to help them (Je. 14° 44°),** but rather that their entire conception of him was wrong,—in other words, they did not know Yahweh. —14.

This puts more strongly the thought already expressed in v.¥. That they do think evil of him is evident from the abandonment of him involved in going after Egypt and Assyria, for there could be no association with these nations without some recognition of their deities.

Cf. the vineyard which was expected to yield good grapes, but actually yielded wild grapes, Is. 5'7.— Their princes shall fall by the sword because of the insolence of their tongues| For are not the princes (z.e. the leaders) everywhere represented as being primarily responsible? Upon them espe- cially will fall the doom which the sword of Assyria §§ will execute. It is because the Egyptian party has secured the supremacy that this evil fate is announced. The leaders who have persuaded their followers to adopt a policy hostile to Yahweh’s teachings and threatenings will now suffer the misery which must surely follow.

4. Since they have made kings, but not from me| This is not a reference to (1) a contemporary king, ¢.g. Menahem (cf. 71°) ; * nor to (2) the godless way of choosing kings referred to in 7°*"5f nor to (3) the fact of frequent choosing and deposition of kings in the time of the prophet (cf. 727 8" 2 K.15).{ The prophet has in mind rather the circumstances under which the kingdom was divided, the establishment of Jeroboam I., and the history in detail, which followed these events.§ He clearly condemns the schism, although this had come about in part as the result of prophetic work (1 K. 11% 12%"). This contradiction is one which is to be expected as between prophets of a higher and lower rank, and between those of an earlier and later period. “A prophet could only declare the will of God with regard to the particular case laid before him.” || The contradiction is not reconciled by the statement that while Jeroboam was God’s choice the people did not consult him (God) at the time, or that Jeroboam, after being told God’s purpose, took wrong means to accomplish it. The two accounts proceed from different points of view. In one, the schism is a punishment upon Reho- boam and his followers ; in the other, it is the source of the evils in existence in the prophetic times. — (And) since they have made princes, but I knew (them) not] This is only the poetical repetition of the idea contained in the former line, referring perhaps to the subordinate officers of the royal administration ; ** cf. 3* 7° 8 13”.

These are the kings established by men, and the gods manufactured by men; as with one, so with the

For out of Israel is it] This clause states the ground for Yahweh’s loathing of the calf, and, with ** transferred and °* treated as a gloss, joins itself directly to the principal clause. The images of Yahweh have never been sanctioned by him. The fact that these images are of entirely human origin furnishes the basis for Yahweh’s scorn (cf. 13? Is. 37 40%” 41’). The 1 of Nim) seems to be superfluous. If retained, it would be read zs this also, referring to the kings, who, like the idols, were without divine approval. This calf is something which has its origin in Israel. The phrase in contrast with Israel is not “ other nations,” as if the prophet was meeting the plea that this custom was of foreign origin.* The next clause finishes and amplifies the thought. — A smith made tt and it ts not God] Cf. 13°; it has no real existence. The people addressed have evidently come to believe that the image and God are identical. The prophet assures them that it is from Israel and is not God.t — Like splinters Samaria’s calf shall become | Utter destruction awaits this emblem of and substitute for deity. This reads 3 for ‘> (v.s.), and makes the clause a part of the general sentence beginning with this verse. On D353 v2.

According to SAG, z¢ has no stalk, the pronoun refers to Israel, but in that case 85 would be expected. If taken as suggested,* "5 would be expected instead of 15, for mp is feminine. The fact of the symmetry gained by this reading is, however, convincing. — Which yields no grain] i.e. is utterly worthless. — Jf perchance it were to yield, strangers would devour z¢| All that Israel might hope to gain will pass over into the hands of the enemy.t The figure continues through to the end, ¢ and does not go over in the latter half to a description of actual events. § — 8.

It does not mean that the nation as well as the fruit shall be swallowed, for vb) is not a prophetic perfect.** — Already are they among the nations] This is the simple prose interpretation of the figures which have been used (cf. 7%).

be inflicted upon them, viz. the exile, but as an act of faithlessness and guilt. This statement presents still more literally and specifi- cally the exact situation. Note (1) Israel is swallowed up; (2) (the more prosaic form of the same thought) they are already among the nations; and now (3) (the very specific expression) they have gone up to Assyria. The going up to Assyria was for assistance and marked dependence upon a foreign power. — A wild ass taking his way by himself] This is not Assyria,* but Israel; + for (r) it is to Israel that the application of the figure is appropriate, viz. wilfulness; (2) there is a pun on the words “op and omaN. The wild ass usually moves in droves, { but this representation of solitariness marks Israel’s case as all the more peculiar. Perhaps this clause should go with the following, § but it is more natural || to take N7 as figurative of wilfulness than as denoting love of independence (cf. Gn. 16” Jb. 39°*), as the connection with the following would involve.— Ephraim gives love-gifts| These are the gifts by means of which Israel sought connection with Egypt and Assyria. Wellhausen’s suggestion to substitute “Egypt” for “Ephraim,” rendering, o Egypt they give love-gifts, is strongly supported by the parallelism ; cf. 6. — 10. Also af they give themselves among the nations, I must now gather them in| This verse is a later addition.{ This is at once apparent if oxspx is taken as a promise to gather them after they have been scattered among the nations in exile; but it is clear also upon the other interpretation. As Simson has pointed out, no single word of this entire verse is of certain meaning. In a\the thought turns on the interpretation of oxapsx; the suffix refers to Israel,** not to the nations.f{ The verbal idea is not a promise, }{ but a threat.§§ If the nations were to have been gathered against Israel, something indicating this would have been inserted. It is Israel that is to be gathered in, #.e. brought back home, put under restraint, imprisoned, deprived of judgment, taken into exile ; cf.

24f 38f 813.95. This entering into relationship with outside nations must cease. “The time has come for me to check their misplaced activity.” ‘3 63 means therefore even if (cf. 9" Is. 1% Ps. 23*) rather than yea though.* ‘3m is treated, of course, like the tsn7 of the pre- ceding verse. — And they must cease for a while from the anointing of kings and princes] Here the uncertainty turns first upon the treat- ment of on". Three principal suggestions may be considered ac- cording as the word is taken from: (1) 55n, ¢o degin, 7.e. they begin to be diminished ¢ (uy = inf.), or to become less (wyn = adv.) f on account of the burden, etc.; (2) din, % be in pain, to grieve, and pointed without the Daghesh 35m (so 10 Mss. and 44 Edi- tions §), z.e. and they shall suffer, or grieve a little on account of, etc. ;|| (3) Don, the text being changed to %54m (u.s.), tc. And they will cease for a little (or soon), etc. Adopting the third, it is better also to adopt the © text, nv», from anointing, instead of xwmr (v.s.). The latter has been thought to refer to the tribute imposed by the king of Assyria, omw 75 being taken in annexion, king of princes. With the second suggestion made above, this would fulfil the demands of the context in yielding a statement having the force of a threat. The @ text, however, furnishes an easier solution, and one especially appropriate. There will be a ceasing, says the prophet, from this continual anointing of kings and princes (a case of asyndeton). In this interpretation, va may be taken in the sense of soon (cf. Ps. 2” 81%) or fora Uittle while. ‘The latter is of course the more usual and, here, the more caustic.

11. For Ephraim has made many altars] It was the common notion (Is. 1”) that the more sacrifices offered (or altars built) the more pleasing was it to the national deity. The xwnd, if retained, indicates that the opposite of this is true, viz. that this multiplication of altars results merely 7 sinning.* Tf retained with the pointing xiam> ¢ (the inf. absolute being used for the sake of the rhythm), the meaning would be that Ephraim’s purpose in all this was 40 make atonement, i.e. to secure expiation of sin; a purpose which the second member shows to have been futile ; but this idea is scarcely consistent with this period. It seems better, therefore, to omit the word in this line (v.s.). — They are to him altars — for sinning| What was thought to be action deserving commendation is condemned. The more altars, the greater and deeper is Israel’s guilt. wn is not used in a double sense, { viz. the sin of the act and the calamity resulting from the act, since the latter idea is not possible in this connection.§ To retain the xem of the first line involves a repetition amounting to tautology, and greatly weakens, instead of strengthening, the sense. || It is not enough to use the word in one sense in the first line, and in another in the second. —12.

indicating that what had occurred was continuing still; * or (@) a future, 7 will write; t or (e) a present perfect, 7 have written ; } or (/) apast, /wrove ; § or (g) an imperfect of customary action, I am wont to write; \| or (h) hypothetical, were J to write, etc., though I wrote, etc.§ The importance of this utterance lies in the testimony which it furnishes to the existence of laws or a code of laws in Hosea’s time. We decide first in favor of 12", myriad (although this occurs elsewhere only among late writers, v.2.), because: (a) "37 as a plural occurs nowhere else ; (4) nothing is gained by substituting 37 or any of its cognate forms, all convey- ing the same idea, that of mu/t#tude, an idea which itself is identical with that of 155, Zz thousand; (c) while "37 is easy and plausible, it is impossible to imagine how, if once it had a position in the text, anything could have been allowed to take its place. It follows, almost without argument, that my ews (pl.) (for which no consonantal change is required) combines more easily with myriad or ten thousand than does my daw (sg.) ; for the thought plainly in Hosea’s mind was the multiplicity, and not the unity, of the laws. Little can be said for the Hiph., 7 cause to write ; it only remains to settle the tense force of sinsx. If the writer had intended past or present perfect, z.¢. if he had wished to mark it as a definite fact, he would naturally have used the perfect tense. The present, whether historical or voluntative, fails to meet the demands of the context, although both would emphasize the idea that the laws were still in process of being written or collected, or, in other words, that the collection was not yet finished. ‘The future makes no sense whatever. Upon the whole the hypothetical force seems to be preferable, Were I to write my laws by myriads, t.e.if I were to write laws so many that they could not be numbered ; or, if the laws that have been written should be increased indefinitely (to ten thousand), —a statement which presupposes: (a) that in Hosea’s time the custom was established of reducing instruction to writing ;** (4) the possibil- ity of increasing the number, ¢.e. a conception that the list was incomplete ; f+ (¢) that the laws.in existence were not being ob-

served, although the prophets were defending them (cf. 4°°) ; and consequently (@) that they were not the ceremonial laws regulat- ing the work of the priests, for this work the prophet condemns because he does not regard it as a part of Yahweh’s instruction (cf. Is. 1*),* but rather prophetic instructions, laws relating to “civil justice and the applications of a plain but religiously sanctioned morality (cf. the so-called Book of the Covenant, Ex. 20%-23%).” + Among the prophets térah = instruction, and refers to the admonition of the prophets (cf.

In Deuteronomy séatuies and judgments is the phrase which expresses the idea of law; while forah is still used of oral instruction.{ It is urged § against this interpretation: (1) that the analogy of other Semitic religions, in which, from the first, the ceremonial and ethical appear together, is against the position that the instruction referred to was ethical rather than ceremonial; (2) that this proposition does not explain the fundamental significance of the symbolism of ceremony in ancient religions ; and (3) the existence of such ceremonial ele- ments in the Decalogue and Book of the Covenant ; while (4) there stands against it the presupposition of an extensive priestly law in Deuteronomy. It is maintained, still further||: (1) that even granting the hypothetical translation, the passage proves “ the existence of a detailed and copious law embracing the subject of sacrifice, which the prophet held to be from God, and charged both priests and people with neglecting” ; (2) that, however, the tense (pf.) of 12wm) renders the hypothetical construction impossi- ble, and favors the treatment of 31n>x as historical (cf. Ps. 103”) ; and (3) that the hypothetical explanation involves certain incon- gruities which are fatal, ¢.g. would ten thousand requirements be more likely to secure obedience than a smaller number? — As those of a stranger they would be accounted | and therefore of no

binding force ; for how could the laws of one nation be regarded as authoritative by another? Cf. Gn. 19%. The matter may be summed up: Hosea condemns those of his time, priests and peo- ple, who are observing in great detail a sacrificial cult (v.") and accuses them, although they are very busy in the observance of this cult, of having forgotten Yahweh (4°*). These people, he says, would count even a myriad of Yahweh’s laws, if they were written for them, as the prophecy of a stranger and therefore as not bind- ing. They have in mind nothing but offerings; they forget the divine instructions delivered by the prophets. —18. Jy offerings of... they sacrifice flesh, and they eat it| The easiest disposi- tion of the words "=" ‘n31, and the one most common, is to render my sacrificial gifts (v.t.) they sacrifice, etc., which is interpreted to mean that sacrifice, with them, is merely formal, the important thing being the “luxury of a dinner of flesh-meat’’;* but this is almost meaningless in this connection. The same thing may be said of the slightly varying translations, sacrifices of my own gifts,t as a sacrifice of my gifts,t etc. Essentially different are the interpretations which understand "373" to mean raw flesh (v.t.),§ or roast sacrifices (v.7.).|| @ (v.s.) connects the first two words with the preceding, viz. “and my laws were reckoned as those of a stranger, the beloved sacrifices” ; while some treat them as a gloss and thus secure the simple reading, ¢hey sacrifice fiesh and they eat it There is not very great choice in the midst of so many difficulties. — Yahweh having no delight in them] On 735, v.2.

poetical expression for captivity in general ; or a prediction of cap- tivity in Egypt, parallel with the more frequent prediction of an Assyrian captivity. In favor of the second supposition may be cited (1) the repetition of the threat (v.s.), (2) the threat in Is. 78 of a double invasion from Egypt and Assyria, (3) the con- stant vacillation between the two political parties, one of which advocated alliance with Egypt, the other with Assyria; but above all (4) the predictions of restoration from Egypt in Is. a he Mi. 72. It would be interesting if in this connection it could be shown that @’s addition to this verse (v.s.), and in Assyria they shall eat the unclean thing, were anything but a gloss borrowed from 9%.*—14. And so Israel forgot his maker and built palaces | This verse is a later addition,t for (1) the reference to Judah is uncalled for; (2) the style resembles that of Amos rather than Hosea; (3) the natural conclusion of the discourse is in ve v.4 only weakens the climax; (4) the thought of Yahweh as Israel’s creator is unexpected in Hosea’s time; (5) the verse is superfluous in the strophic system. The abandonment of Yahweh in the opinion of the prophet is contemporaneous with and in proportion to the steps taken to exhibit self-dependence. /a/aces (rather than the more common rendering of mba ¢emples) must be understood (v.z.), since we may ascribe neither to Hosea nor to a later author the opinion that the building of the temple was a wicked thing. — And Judah multiplied fenced cities| The poetic parallel for the preceding statement. — And so I will send fire upon his cities, and it shall devour his palaces | Cf.

This piece is marked by a peculiar definiteness and clearness. Perhaps y.5 forms an exception to this statement. It consists of three strophes, each of which is introduced by a three-membered clause, after which come perfectly regular couplets: strophe 1, 3+2+2+ 2+ 2; strophe 2,3+2+2+42; strophe 3, 3 +2+2-+ 2. Strophe 1 warns against the heathenish joy of their celebrations, for soon there will be no libations nor sacrifices. Strophe 2 announces the exile, during which the celebration of feast-days and festivals will be impossible. Strophe 3 describes days of visitation. The following modifications are to be adopted: (1) the transfer of v.8 to precede v.5; (2) the treatment of v.° as a gloss.

IX. 1. Do not rejoice, Israel, like the peoples| The words are addressed to Israel at a time when the nation is engaged in the midst of the wild and exuberant celebration of a harvest feast. It is, perhaps, also a time when Assyria’s hand, for a moment, seems to have been lifted, and Israel permitted to breathe more freely (cf. 2 K. 15%). Instead of (1) retaining dbx = unto exultation = wo loudly, cf. Jb. 3”;* or (2) reading b»y-b (v.5.), which is irregular in that an imperfect would have been expected; it is better (3) to omit the phrase as a gloss on mawn bx.t This harvest-rejoicing places Israel on a plane

with other nations, ze. makes her “ke the peoples, the heathen. What, in the prophet’s mind, constituted the difference ? The people in their celebration acknowledge the harvest to be a gift of the god of the land in return for their sedulous worship, thus making material gain the goal and the reward of worship ; while it is the prophet’s contention that divine blessings are bestowed for real worth and character (Dt. 28'*). Here is opposition between the folk-religion and the true Yahweh-religion as preached by the prophet. It is here that ovsy is first used in the sense of heathen.* — That thou hast played the harlot Jrom thy God] Is this the ground of the command not to rejoice,f or is that ground to be found later in the statement that threshing-floor aud wine-vat will not know them (v.*).t In the latter case, "3 = that, in that, and the following clauses furnish the substance of the rejoicing, not the reason or occasion.§ — Thou hast loved a harlot’s hire upon all threshing-floors| Accepting the harvest-fruits as from the Baalim commits Israel to the service of the Baalim. Every celebration of a local festival is, therefore, an act of harlotry, in which the harlot acknowledges her paramour and accepts his gift, 7c. the harlot’s hire. The sin here is not worshipping on the high places, but ob- serving a cult in which debasing tendencies are at work, instead of those which would elevate and ennoble. It is, in other words, a case of the material vs. the spiritual (cf. Zc. 147°). ym is unnecessary and may be omitted. —2. Zhreshing-floor and wine- vat shall not know them| Feed them|| (cf. 4%) is not an easy expression with the subject here indicated. The reading oy: is very natural and is supported by the parallel phrase wn. The floor and the vat (the place within the press into which oil or wine flowed, cf. Jo. 2%) stand, concretely, for the grain and oil and wine, these henceforth will not know, z.e. be known to, Israel, not because a failure of crops is to be expected, but because they are to be carried into exile.** — And the new wine shall play them false| Cf. Hb. 3%. The reading her, if correct, is due to Israel’s representation as a harlot; but (1) the versions

(v.s.) read them; (2) everywhere else in chaps. 4-14, Israel is spoken of as he (thou) or they (ye) (even in 4% 10”, in com- parison with feminine animals).*—4. They shall not pour hiba- tions to Yahweh|+ In eating and drinking at sacrificial meals a portion of the wine was devoted to the deity and poured out as a libation, the rest was drunk in connection with the offering (cf. Am. 2° 1 S. 1% 10%). If this custom be interfered with in the exile, the whole of the wine in general will become unclean, and therefore unpleasing to Yahweh.— Vor prepare for him their sacrifices| This is the simplest treatment, although it re- quires the change of 15"v" to 12°w (v.s.) and the connection of omns! with this verb as object contrary to the accents.{ To represent the sacrifices as wnpleasing to Yahweh § (cf. Je. 6” Mal. 34) is inconsistent with v.** and with chap. 3, which say that there shall be no sacrifice at all. The word >v, used of laying in order the parts of the sacrifice, is common (Ly. 17°” 6° Ex. 40"; cf. Ps. 23°). It must be remembered that sacrifice and feasting upon animal food were inseparable. || — Zheir bread shall be like the bread of mourning] ie. nram> for and. Just as the wine they drink and the flesh they eat will be taken without giving thereof a due portion to Yahweh, and conse- quently will be unconsecrated and unclean, and without “ the joy of the sense of the divine favor,” so the bread which they eat will be unclean; it will be, in fact, like the bread of mourning, t.e. the bread eaten during the days of mourning for the dead (Nu. 19"), or, better, the bread used at the funeral feasts and broken for the dead (cf. Je. 16’ Dt. 26%). No stronger impression for impurity could have been found ; and yet all bread eaten in exile will be thus impure.— AW who

eat shall defile themselves] The idea of cleanness and unclean- ness is very old; it is to be connected closely with the ideas of ancestor worship and totemism, and is, in fact, only another name for taboo;* and there is, therefore, nothing in this to prove the observance at this time of the Levitical cult. — For their bread shall be only for their hunger| Instead of the double purpose involved in eating as heretofore, viz. worship of, or communion with, the deity, and satisfaction of desire for food, only the latter shall now exist. All that was holy and sacred, all that was spiritual, will have disappeared. This is the idea whether we render awn for themselves,t or for their belly,t or for their desire or hunger § (cf. also Is. 29% 32° Ps. 63° 107°). — Tt shall not come into Yahweh's house] t.e. any place consecrated to Yahweh, e.g. the temple, or a high place. —38. They shall not dwell in the land of Yahweh] This is the explanation of the dire threat contained in vs.'*4; they will be compelled to abandon their home land, the land of Yahweh. ‘This expression furnishes the key to an understanding of the O.T. religion down to the exile. The old Arabic tribal conception of God, involv- ing on the one hand a belief in the personality of God which opposes a tendency toward pantheism, and on the other, a belief in the deity as an abstract representation of irresistible power and force, which was opposed to polytheism, developed into henotheism or monolatry, according to which each nation had its own god (Chemosh, the god of Moab; Milcom, the god of Ammon). In this way Yahweh was the god of Israel (Ju. 11”). This was a worship of one god, but also an acknowledgment of the existence of other gods for other lands and peoples.|| As clear cases of this belief, cf. Naaman the Syrian, who takes home earth from Palestine on which to worship Yahweh, who had cured him (2 K. 5”); the flight of Jonah, who thought he could thus escape the presence of Yahweh (Jon. 1°) ; and the feeling of David that in being driven out of Israel into another

This reference is not simply a “type of the land of captivity,” Assyria being intended and designated thus as a new Egypt.* The fact is, that at this time Israel was between two great threatening powers. It is not yet certain in the prophet’s mind whether Egypt or Assyria, or both, shall be the agent of Israel’s exile. Both are tyrannizing over her. Toward both Israel leans (cf. 5% 7%). Time will determine the issue more definitely. — And in Assyria they shall eat what is unclean] Ci ergek Living in a foreign land and eating that which is unclean are synonymous terms. The situation is now squarely before them. Perhaps they will consider (cf. @’s addition to 83).—5.

How, indeed, will they be celebrated at all in a foreign land, where Yahweh’s sanctuaries do not exist ?

ports strongly this interpretation as a whole. The sentence is to be taken with Nowack as a quotation from the mouth of the people (cf. 6’ Is. 28° )* The prophet seems to say: You, the people, maintain, do you, that the prophet has become a fool, and the man of spirit a madman? It is true, just as you say, but learn that this great calamity has come upon them because of the greatness of thine iniquity and the greatness of thy sin] It is Israel’s iniquity and sin (adopting Ruben’s suggestion to substitute mon, sz, for mauve) that have driven mad the inspired messengers of Yahweh. This same thought is ampli- fied in the following verses. —8. This verse is almost hope- lessly confused. The more important solutions proposed are the following: (1) Zphraim’s watchman, appointed by my God, even the prophet—a fowlers snare ts in all his ways; { this interpretation involves the reading of oye for ov, a © having dropped out after DEX; and uses the word “ watchman” as in Je. 6. The result is a sentence giving an appropriate thought, but so involved in expression as to make it very doubtful. (2) Ephraim acts the spy with my God; the prophet is a fowler's snare upon all his (Israel’s) ways.{ Variations of this interpretation are three: (@) Ephraim lays ambush against the people (ay instead of ny) of my God ;§ (4) Ephraim looks round about outside of (away from) my God (for foreign help) ; | (c) Ephraim looks after prophecies in addition to those from my God.§ (3) Ephraim expects help from my God,** treating mpy as in Ps. 5? Mi. 7” La. 4”, and op as for ope (cf. Jb. at). (4) There is hostility to the watchman in the house of his God; the prophet (finds) the snares of the fowler on all his ways.t This interpretation involves considerable change in the text, viz. (a) the transfer of Mmwwn from the end of v.’ to the beginning of v8; (4) the omission of wbx ov ompx (cf. Ruben’s suggestion that these words stood originally in connection with Sew ws (v..) in this form: "758 Opt DEX “BS Syqw? ww, the “aX having dropped out, om being for oy); (¢) the omission of mauwn in °° as useless repetition; (d@) the transfer of '8 ma to follow 75x,

—all this disorder being due to efforts to restore the meaning, when by mistake mmuwm was placed at the end of v.’, instead of the beginning of v.’. The parallelism is perfect, and the sense excellent.* I desire, however, to suggest the following arrangement, which renders unnecessary certain omissions and changes involved in Nowack’s interpretation: Enmity exists tow- ards Ephraim’s watchman; the prophet (finds) the snares of the fowler in all his ways; in the (very) house of his God they dig Jor him a deep pit] This interpretation follows Nowack only in transferring Maywe from the end of vy.” to the beginning of v.’, and in the omission of ‘">x oy. A preposition, 5 or 5y, must be inserted. It adopts Wellhausen’s suggestion to place the first two words of v.*, innw \pyavn, at the end of v.’, giving them another pointing. With this interpretation v. supplements v.’, adding three expressions, of which the first is the simple state- ment, the second and third poetical pictures and _ illustrations. The watchman (cf. Ez. 3”") of Ephraim meets persecution on every side ; fowler’s snares compass about the prophet; a deep pit is digged for him even in the house of his God. House here, as in v.¥, means Canaan.— 9.

Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel] t.e. with the same satisfaction and pleasure with which one finds grapes in a wilderness, I found Israel; this connects "3% closely with pay>,* and not with ‘nsx f+ (= I found Israel in the wilderness like wild grapes belonging to no one, and under no one’s protec- tion, z.e. poor and helpless), nor with both "S323 and oaiy5 f (= like grapes which have no place in the wilderness, and are not expected to be found there, so was Israel; and the discovery of Israel in this unexpected place brought with it surprise and joy). This interpretation is supported by the position of the words, and by the parallel thought of the next line; cf. Je. 2°, also Ho. 2% 13!. This expression is an allusion to the dwelling of Israel in the wilderness. — Like the first-fruit on a fig tree I saw your fathers| The first ripe fig, on account of the lateness of the fig harvest in Palestine, § was always a great delicacy (cf. Is. 28* Mi. 7’). In Je. 247° the better class of people are compared to the first ripe figs.

Zph- raim—his glory flies away like a bird] With the swiftness of the bird’s flight will Ephraim’s glory depart. The construc- tion places special emphasis upon Ephraim, to bring the former fruitfulness (the idea contained in the name) into contrast with the coming calamity, which shall consist in lack of everything which made up Ephraim’s glory, z.e. prosperity, honor among the nations, and, as a prominent element, children. — Zhere shall be no more birth, no more motherhood, no more con- ception| This, the greatest possible curse, was the punishment threatened for their lack of chastity. The construction is singu- larly terse and strong. The order is climactic: women will not conceive ; if they do, the child will die in the womb; if it should survive the embryonic period, it will die at birth. Cf. 4%. Does not their sin against chastity deserve this? Cf. Halévy’s interpre- tation of these words, in which he reverses the order of the climax. —16.

also relieves an important difficulty in the strophic structure. The figure of the tree is adopted; Ephraim is like a tree smitten by worms (Jon. 4”) or by heat (Je. 17°) ; and, worst of all, the very root is destroyed, thus leaving no hope of further growth (cf. Am. 2° Mal. 4’, and for the opposite idea, Is. 11} Ps. 1°). — Fruit they cannot produce| This is the sum and substance of the whole thing. — Yea, though they beget children, I will slay the darlings of their womb| This means practically that they will bear no fruit. — 12.

This statement follows natu- rally upon 7®°, and is in strict accord with the Hebrew method of statement, viz. to make a general and absolute statement, and then to add the exception or modification (cf.

Ephraim’s ruin; and this is an appeal for that absolute ruin which is involved in the failure of a tribe or nation to propagate itself. To understand that this ejaculation is born of a sympathy which asks for the prevention of births that those born may not be compelled to suffer is far-fetched. The imperative, give, implies the opposite. The question is rhetorical, indicating excitement, and is intended not merely to furnish a basis for the repetition of v.", nor to ascertain the divine mind,* but = what would I have thee give? i.e. the prophet’s own wish and prayer. — A miscarrying womb and dry breasts| The give them found in fA is superfluous and spoils the line. It is omitted in G. Unfruitful- ness was regarded as a special and definite punishment from the deity; cf. Gn. 25% 30'*. This punishment stands related as a climax to that which has before been uttered ; it also bears upon one of the chief sins of Jeroboam’s time, the pride taken by the people in their numbers and prosperity; cf. Am. 6! 4* Ho. 2° ro! 12°.{ —15. AU their evil being in Gilgal] A circumstantial clause = since the consummation of their mischief (or calamity t) ts in Gilgal; this use of 55 (cf.

The reason assigned, one of the most important in the whole list of causes of the coming destruc- tion, is the apostasy of the leaders. The same phrase with its

This clause is out of place in AG, in which it not only has no logical connec- tion with what precedes, but actually interrupts a closely con- nected passage.* Here it forms a fitting climax to a series of strong assertions, the idea of all of which is the abandonment of Israel by Yahweh. ‘5, here asseverative, is tautological if joined with 2%, which also is introduced by an asseverative ">. The Oi, here indicating the climax, is impossible after ”°, as is seen by the effort of interpreters to make it refer to on> rather than tof "®.

My God will cast them away, for they have not hearkened to him| The prophet now speaks, summing up the thought of Yahweh as it has been given in vs.™*, Yahweh had said, “I will drive them out of my house; I will no more love them; yea, even woe upon them !” The prophet says, JZy God (for since they will no longer listen to him he may no longer be called Israel’s God) we/ cast them away. They had been chosen ("m3) from among all the nations; cf. Dt. 32° Ez. 5° Am. 6!

§13. Israel is wicked in proportion to her prosperity: but an end is coming of all that she has falsely trusted. 10'*. Israel was a luxuriant vine, but in proportion to her prosperity she multiplied altars and pillars; however, she will now be declared guilty, and her altars and pillars will be destroyed (10"*). On account of the idol-calf, people and priest shall mourn ; for it shall be carried to Assyria, a token of Ephraim’s shame (10*°). The high places shall be destroyed, thorns and thistles growing over them; the king of Samaria shall be cut off; and the people shall even pray to the mountains and hills to fall upon them (1087),
This piece consists of six four-line, or perhaps better, of three eight-line strophes. Removing the glosses in vs.° 8% (v.2.), the arrangement becomes 8+7+7. The movement is trimeter, although dimeters are occasionally employed, and in the last strophe the elegiac movement is used. Strophe 1 (vs.1-?) pictures Israel as a fruitful vine, and with the increase of fruitfulness, has come also an increase of idol-serving; but now that she has been found guilty these emblems of idolatry shall be destroyed. Strophe 2 (vs.°-®) describes the carrying away to Assyria of the idol-calf in which she has taken such pleasure, which, therefore, has been her shame. Strophe 3 (vs.84- 7. 83) declares that the high places shall be destroyed, the altars grown over with thorns and thistles, while even the king shall be cut off, and men in the con- fusion of the judgment will call upon the mountains and the hills to fall upon and cover them up.

X. 1. A luxuriant vine is Israel] i.e. a vine running luxuri- antly, sending out shoots, a fruitful vine, prosperous.* With this may be compared the view f that makes Israel a pillaged vine, ze. stripped of its fruit, which, however, after the robbing will lay up fruit for itself; and the very common view { which renders ppa empty, t.e. one which pours out into leaves, but has no fruit. This statement is an extension of 9"; cf. the vine mmmp, Ez. 17°. Halévy makes pps predicate with the meaning /ay waste, destroy (cf. Is. 24' Na. 2”) = Lsvael lays waste the vine which has fur- nished him its fruit; but this is not supported by the history of interpretation, nor by analogy (v.s.).— He multiplies fruit for him- self| The thought here is obscure. The following have been suggested: (1) Which yields fruit for itself, referring to the vine ; § (2) Who yields fruit for himself, referring to Israel;|| (3) He putieth forth his fruit; (4) And the fruit ts like him ;** (5) Fler (the vine’s) fruit flourishing (so @ using perhaps %>w or mou; cf. Zc. 7’ Jb. 21% Ps. 73% 122° Ez. 16.) But none of these gives an adequate sense. Perhaps the rendering given above t{ (reading x*3¥"), which furnishes an idea corresponding to pps of the preceding line, may be adopted. G. A. Smith (using mw or mw) renders, “he lavishes his fruit,”” while Gardner’s read- ing gives just the opposite, “an evil fruit is his.” —Jn proportion to the increase of his fruit he multiplied altars; in proportion to the prosperity of his land, he made beautiful the pillars] i.e. the more fruit, the more altars did he build ; the more prosperous the land, the more beautiful were the pillars (or statues) which he

It is unnecessary to suppose there is any refer- ence to the striking off of horns (Am. 3") ;{{ the word used elsewhere only of animals is here used metaphorically. The par- allelism of order between these lines and the first of the strophe is to be noted. This representation of punishment is in contrast with the picture of prosperity just presented.—3.

No Israelite of Hosea’s time could have acknowledged that he did not fear Yahweh ; as a matter of fact he was engaged most assiduously in a worship every part of which pointed in this direction.

Am. 6” ; or (3), after all, punishment, which shall be as bitter (cf. Dt. 29 La. 3 Je. 9"), and as plenteous as wx7.} Cf. @’s interpre- tation = grass. It has been suggested by Nowack that either another word be substituted for ww», which shall mean “ evil,” or that wxn> tpan be read after Am. 6” (cf. Ho. 4”), te. and judgment they turn to poppy; but (3) above seems satisfactory. Cheyne suggests that this judgment began with the man who was foremost in those illegitimate covenants — the prophet’s royal name- sake, Hoshea (2 K. 17*). ws has been rendered dztterness, § poppy, || weeds, poison, or wormwood,** hemlock ; tt and wEwr has been emended (v.s.) to murder or backshiding,{} falsehood, like thistles,§§ destruction.||\|—5. For the calf of Beth-aven the inhabitants of Samaria shall tremble] We come back now to the original utterance, and to the beginning of the second 8-line strophe. The occasion of the approaching punishment is here stated to be the worship of the calf (cf. the different representa- tion in v.4*). The connection with v.” is very close. While now Israel identifies the calf-image with Yahweh, the prophet sees no relationship between them. There are no words too scornful for him to use of the calf. Cadf (cf. ) is to be preferred to calves, because of the singular suffix in tay and a> and because prob- ably only one image was set up in each place. For explana- tions of this feminine plural, see p. 348. Beth-aven is probably ironical and contemptuous for bs ms, cf. 4% Am. 74.9Q On 1Dw, v2. Cheyne’s demoan instead of tremble for is interesting in view of the parallelism. For other readings, v.s.— Yea, his people shall mourn for him| The perfect, if retained, is prophetic ; perhaps the imperfect should be read (v.s.).— And his priestlings shall writhe for him] Yom for 7, v.s.

§ 14. Israel’s history consists of sin, guilt; the fruit of such seed is a sad harvest, desolation, destruction, and death, — even of the king. 10*%. From the days of Gibeah, Israel has sinned: Ephraim is a heifer desiring to tread the corn, but I will spoil her beauty with a yoke upon her neck, and she shall be made to draw, to plough, and to harrow (*"). Sow in righteousness and reap in love ; break off evil habits; there is still time to seek Yahweh and obtain his favor ; (I exhort you thus) for hitherto you have sowed wickedness and reaped punishment; you have made it your policy to lie, and to trust in chariots and warriors (2 4), But for this reason ruin is coming, tumult, the destruction of fortune ; and in a morning your king shall be cut off (2% +),
This piece consists of three strophes, each having seven lines of the trime- ter movement. The strophic structure and measure prove conclusively that the piece is entirely distinct from 10!, although treating of the same subject. For that matter, all of the chapters now treat of the same subject. Strophe 1 brings up out of the past “days of Gibeah,” when Israel sinned; however beautiful and prosperous she may be, hard burdens are before her — burdens which will prove very heavy (vs), Strophe 2 recites the fact that it is not too late to secure Yahweh’s favor, if the right methods are followed, if old habits are broken off; but to this end an entire change of policy will be demanded in comparison with that of the past, in which deceit and faithless- ness to Yahweh have been the principal elements (vs.! 34), Strophe 3 pictures the ruin which for this reason is coming quickly and surely —a ruin that will involve land, city, and king (vs.184-14¢.15), In this arrangement, vs,10. 140 are regarded as later additions (v.z.).

9. From the days of Gibeah is Israel’s sin] i.e. the sin (MXR for mX~m because the address is not continued *) of Israel is something which goes back to earliest times. But what is meant by the days of Gibeah, from which (not more than in which,} nor as in which ="%>,{ Israel now sins) this sin dates? Three answers have been given: (1) The episode of the Benjamites at Gibeah (Ju. 19”) ;§ but since there Israel (the eleven tribes) was taking vengeance on one tribe (Benjamin) for an infamous act, and here Israel is represented as committing sin, the allusion is inappropriate || (cf., however, Cheyne’s statement: ‘True, Is- rael as a people took summary vengeance on the Benjamites for the outrage of Gibeah; but the seed of wickedness remained, and developed into evil practices worthy only of the Gibeah of old”). (2) The beginning of the kingdom under Saul which occurred in Gibeah J (cf. 13°"), which (according to Wellhau- sen) Hosea seems to regard as a sin perhaps second only to the cult ; but does Hosea as a matter of fact oppose the kingdom as such? Is it not rather the schism? (3) The idolatry of Micah (Ju. 172*), which marked the beginning, according to tradition, of that which has now spread so far and wide.** — Aft that time there stood against me the sons of unrighteousness| This rendering involves the reading of by for by, and the transfer of ndw "23 ‘Sy from the end of the verse to follow ‘»,t+ a change which permits the passage to give a sensible meaning, and relieves two lines, one of which is too short, the other too long. ow is here temporal {} rather than local; cf. 2 K. 15” Ps. 14°. The sons of unrighteous- ness are either the Benjamites (v.s.), the Israelites as a whole in the case of the selection of Saul, or those associated with Micah. Wellhausen’s suggestion, 23, is unnecessary. Other interpreta- tions of my are: “stood still,” as if Ephraim had acted traitor- ously (cf. the great defeat of the eleven tribes, Ju. 20%”) ; §$ “have

remained (i.e. sinful), should there not overtake them in Gibeah a war against the sons of wrong?” * “stood firm against the sons of wrong,” in contrast with present attitude ; t “there they stand (now) defiant like the old Benjamites.” { For interpretations involving textual change, v.s.— Shall not war overtake them even in Gibeah ? | Interpreters (e.g. Ruben) have been greatly perplexed to find any meaning for this line. The removal to the preceding line of dw 3 "Sy seems to relieve somewhat the difficulty. § This difficulty is seen, ¢.g., in G. A. Smith’s rendering, “there have they remained, and this without war overtaking them in Gibeah against the dastards;” also Cheyne’s, “there they stood that the war against the sons of unrighteousness might not over- take them at Gibeah,”’— both utterly unintelligible, even with the authors’ additional remarks. The sense of the rendering adopted above is easy and natural. Inasmuch as they have sinned, beginning at Gibeah, war shall overtake them, reaching down even to Gibeah; z.e. a war which, coming from the north, shall cover the whole land, and reach even to the southernmost limit, Gibeah ; || for Gibeah was most probably situated about four miles north of Jerusalem, where the Ze//-e/-F'u/ now stands. — 10. Zn my wrath I will chastise them] A reading based on % (v.s.). Other interpretations are: (1) @¥8 “against the children of unrighteousness I have come (= ‘"nmN3) to chastise them ;” ** (2) most common, “in my desire,” “at my will,” “when I de- sire,” cf. Is. 1% Ez. 5% 16%.¢+— And peoples shall be gathered against them] It is this sentence, together with the strophic structure, that makes the authenticity of the verse suspicious. The indefinite “ peoples” marks a later date, it being the invaria- ble custom of the prophets down to Ezekiel to name distinctly the hostile country intended. Hosea always indicates Egypt or Assyria. tt Giesebrecht (Beitrage zur Jesaia-Kritik), in support

(2) Reap the fruit of love, a rendering which reads mad (with @){ for °B> in proportion to,** ze. let your lives be filled with the spirit of love, let the outcome of your activity be characterized by love; om here = not love of God for man, but love of man for fellow-man,tf and with it, love of man for God ; perhaps piety expresses the idea as well as any other English word; cf. Ho. 4' 6*°% With this interpretation compare that which binds together the two imperatives, ty"! and 17x), giving them the conditional force 7f you will sow . . . you shall reap, tt a construction in itself entirely legitimate, but not adapted to the context §§ because of the absence of 1 and the presence of the third imperative, 1%.

prophet’s injunctions ; before sowing the seed prepare the ground which has hitherto been neglected, and in consequence has be- come full of weeds and thorns, z.e. plough virgin soil; in other words, no result may be expected unless the old habits are changed and new character formed.—.Since there is time to seek Yahweh] z.¢. there remains sufficient time ; * not it is high time to seek. t — To the end that the fruit of righteousness may come to you| In favor of this rendering { and the text which underlies it are: (1) © (w.s.); (2) the recurring phrases “ fruit of righteousness” (v.), “ fruit of lies” (v.%); (3) the usage of 4y to express purpose (cf. Jb. 14° Is. 22"); (4) the impropriety of the idea of teaching (GIT 7") in this connection. The two most common renderings (upon basis of A") are “2M he come and rain righteousness, § for which Is. 45° and Ps. 85" are cited as analogies; and “4 he come and teach you righteousness.|| Righteousness here = sa/vaton, deliverance, as frequently in Is. 40-66 (cf. Is. 46” 54” 32 33° Dn. 9%). “ Righteousness is the divine principle af action, salvation the divine principle zz action” (Cheyne). —13. Ye have ploughed wickedness ; injustice ye have reaped | Here, as before, the terms used are not intended to designate consequence; sow, reap, and plough, reap, represent the ordinary activities, and these are, in effect, wickedness and injustice or disaster. This is in direct contrast with the demands set forth in v.¥.— Ye have eaten the Jruit of les| The end of your present policy is already in sight, utter disappointment. — Because thou dost trust in thy chariots, in the multitude of thy mighty ones] Here begins a new strophe, as is seen from (1) the change of thought, for mmes "> must go with the following rather than with the preceding lines, since (a) the reason for the disappointment expressed in "7 and>s8 has already been cited in Ye have ploughed, etc.; (6) the 1 in oxpI is resumptive, pointing to an occasion or reason already given ; (2) the change of form from second plural to second singular. Nowack’s first objection (that the ground of the judgment in v." is by this assigned to something which is not elsewhere emphasized in Hosea) is insufficient, for this is (2) only another way of saying

that they no longer trust in Yahweh, and (4) exactly what Isaiah in his early sermons (2°*) emphasizes so strongly; while his second objection (that the idea of arrogant self-trust is incon- sistent with the actual weakness and hesitation of the time implied in their throwing themselves into the arms, now of Assyria, now of Egypt) is contradicted by Isaiah’s representation concerning Judah for the same period (cf. Is. 27). Cf. Wellhausen, who like- wise regards the lines as unauthentic. (3) The strophic structure, which with these lines makes a strophe of seven lines correspond- ing with the two preceding strophes. Volz* regards vs." 84 as a later insertion and v." as misplaced because (1) they interrupt the connection, breaking into the middle of a threat of punishment with a warning accompanied by a promise of deliverance to which no reference is made in the context; (2) the figure changes, — in vy." Judah-Jacob is the animal engaged in agriculture, in v.¥ it is the sower ; (3) there are linguistic difficulties, ¢.g. Ap7x, which occurs only here in Hosea, and px denote a right state of heart, the common meaning in late literature, while in Amos and Isaiah they refer to external, forensic righteousness ; this usage of ‘Bd is paralleled in Pr. 12° 2771; “3 "9 seems more original in Je. 4° than here ; pwn (v.”) is a late word; (4) there are echoes of 6° in x13" and Any and in a1 nyt nx wind (following @). In reply to these objections, Nowack urges (1) that the original significance of vs.° is too uncertain to make the connection of v." with them certain, and (2) that the deeper significance of p»1x was doubtless known in early times. The reading, im thy chariots (v.s.) (72293 for 72755) rather than im thy way t (= in thy policy) is based upon (1) G (v.s.), Jerome, Syro-Hexaplar text ; (2) the parallelism thy heroes; (3) Ho. 1471s. 2"; (4) the demands of the entire con- text.—14.

The heroes and the fortified cities in which Israel had put her trust shall be laid waste. — As Shalman ruined Beth-arbel in the day of war| Both proper names have been the subject of many conjectures. Beth-arbel has been iden- tified (1) with the Assyrian Arbela on the Tigris,* but this was too far away to have produced so strong an impression on the Israelites ; (2) with Arbela near Pella;t (3) with Arbela on the west of the Sea of Tiberias (cf. 1 Macc. 97; Jos. Amd. XII. 11, 1; XIII. 15, 4);¢ cf. the corresponding words in the versions (u.s.) ; @4, rendering Jerudsaal, interprets the passage of Zal- munna (Ju. chaps. 7 and 8).§ Shalman has been identified with (1) Shalmaneser IV., the name being abbreviated (cf. Coniah for Jehoiachin, Je. 22%% 37°) for the sake of rhythm, who became king 727 B.c. and besieged Samaria 724-722 ; | (2) Shalmaneser III., who made an expedition to Lebanon (the cedar-country) in 775 B. c. and to Damascus in 773-772, when he may have invaded the country across the Jordan ; 4 (3) Salamanu, a Moabitish king, contemporaneous with Hosea, mentioned ** by Tiglathpileser as paying tribute ; tf (4) Zalmunna (v.s.); (5) the name of a North Arabian tribe who invaded the Negeb. {{ To be noted further are the following points: (a) the name occurs in Arabian poetry and on a Palmyrene inscription ; (4) the refer- ence is evidently to some great city and well-known king ; this would throw out the Moabitish Shalman and the Palestinian Arbela; (¢) the entire clause is a later insertion because the most reasonable supposition is that the reference is to an Assyrian king; but Hosea elsewhere speaks of the Assyrian king as >» a7, and the king here spoken of would seem to be Shalmaneser IV., who lived after Hosea’s time; cf.

§ 15. Israel a child; Yahweh his father, with all the love of a father, even in the face of ingratitude and desertion. 111, [ called Israel out of Egypt, but he wandered away from me, rendering worship to other gods (*”). And yet it was I who brought him up, teaching him to walk, carrying him in my arms ; leading him kindly, treating him mercifully, gently feeding him (**). He must go back to Egypt, or take Assyria as his king, for he has cast me off (and the sword shall consume him for his bad policy) ; he... (*7). But how can I give him up to destruction like Admah or Zeboim! For I am God and not man. My voice,

This piece is made up of four strophes, each of six or seven lines, having the trimeter movement. The first strophe (12) describes Israel’s rebellious attitude toward his father, Yahweh. The second (* 4) pictures, in contrast, the loving and fatherly attitude of Yahweh toward Israel. The third (*7) declares that he must go into a foreign land, his cities be destroyed, etc. The fourth (84 9% 102-) depicts the agony of the father, who, indeed, is unable to give up the son thus condemned to destruction and to exile, and con- sequently sends forth the summons which calls him back.

parts are from a later hand: (1) 12 nnb>) (v.6); (2) the closing section (vs.82- 94.100. 11),

1. When Israel was young, then I came to love him] As before (cf. 9” 10°), the prophet goes back to Israel’s earliest days — this time (cf. 2* in which the national existence dates from the wandering in the wilderness) to the sojourn in Egypt. In 2¥ this same period is designated as the days of his youth. It was at this period that Yahweh fell to liking him. The verb sxx is inchoative ;* cf. s2w, 9%. 2 is temporal, not causal. “ is very indefinite, including any age from youngest childhood (cf. “pA “wi, 1 S. 1%) to some degree of maturity (Gn. 34 1 K. 20% 1S. 30%); but in its use here of the nation, it is evidently in- tended of the child age. This representation of Israel as a man —at one time young (as here), at another with gray hairs (79) — is very striking. — And out of Egypt I called him] The fAT here

presents serious difficulties of text and interpretation ; viz. (1) usd, my son, implies a call out of Egypt to become Yahweh's son ; but in Ex. 42 Dt. 14) Je. 3 31°”, the standard passages for this idea, no such statement occurs, he js already represented as Yahweh’s son;* (2) Hosea everywhere represents Israel and Yahweh as husband and wife, not as father and sont (but cf. vs2™) ; (3) @ and © read “his sons” 5 (4) difficulties in con- nection with v2 (v.7.). In view of these difficulties, the following renderings have been made: (1) and called my son out of Egypt, t but this does not do justice to the preposition ; (2) and _..L called him to be my son,§ but v.s.; (3) and out of Egypt TL called his sons,\| following © and G, but this is inconsistent with spy as used of xn; (4) and out of Egypt I called him (read- ing “1° instead of ‘25 and taking "I> with following verse) ; this is to be preferred. The use of this phrase in Matthew o has been understood (1) to determine the meaning of Hosea’s words as predictive of the Messiah ; ** (2) to represent Israel as a type of Christ; ff (3) to furnish an illustration of the historical event which the evangelist was describing. tf} This, however, is but one of many instances in which the N. T. interpretation has proceeded upon lines other than those which may be called historical. —2. Zhe more I called them, the farther they went away from me| This reading rests upon a text, in which, (1) "3 (v.s.) has been substituted for "5 and ‘x7p for ixmp (cf. 6), = according to my calling; (2) according to @, oma has been separated into on ee (cf. 5). The ordinary text, they called them, so they went from them, (x) has nothing to which j> may correspond, although in AV. and most translations this is supplied ; (2) leaves the subject (prophets, §§ or idols, |||| all agencies J) unexpressed, thus giving rise to unnecessary confusion; (3) re- quires the on of p77" to be the prophets (subject of 1x7) though the om of ond is Israel, —all of which is inconceivable. This, then, is Yahweh’s ground of complaint, that with every new effort made by him through the prophets of succeeding centuries, Israel became more and more hardened (Is. 6” Je. 7). If this were

true, why should the work of the prophets have been continued? “It kept up a church within the nation, and it developed ideas which bore fruit in due time ” (Cheyne). But was it true? No; for, as a matter of fact, Israel was making progress all the time. Every century was raising Israel farther and farther away from the heathenism on every side, and preparing the nation for the time when the great docttine of monotheism could and would be ac- cepted. The prophet’s statement, thus placed in Yahweh’s mouth, must be judged from the prophet’s own point of view at the time of utterance, and not from the larger point of view gained in the comparative study of centuries of history. — 7hey kept sacrificing to the Baalim, making offerings to images] Cf. 2°", These are details of the departure. The Baalim and the images (wood, metal, stone) of 2 K. 17" Dt. 75% are the same, viz. the calves at Dan and Bethel. The imperfects are frequentative, expressing customary action. —3. Vet zt was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them up in my arms] The “1” is in contrast with the Baalim, and introduces another description of Yahweh’s exhibi- tion of paternal love. Here again G, reading ONS (v.s.) and my arms, furnishes a better text. Only Ephraim is in the mind of the prophet, although he is speaking of a time when Ephraim and Judah were together. Teaching them to. walk = keeping them on their feet; ¢.e. directing in a providential way their foot- steps. To this is added taking them up in my arms, another term expressing paternal fondness and care, exercised when the child is weary (cf. Is. 63° Dt. 1% 32"). The rendering of fAT he took them up has been interpreted of Moses.* — But they did not know that I healed (?) them] Another reproachful touch; for, notwithstanding all that Yahweh did, they failed to recognize his presence and participation. The figure of “ healing” is common in Hosea (5% 6! 71; cf. Ex. 15”), but it does not seem in place here, unless, perhaps, we supply the thought, t when they fell and hurt themselves in their learning to walk. Wellhausen regards B'MXBT as a disturbing element ; Nowack suggests that “I reared them” (Is, 1”) might have been expected ; the suggestion of Graetz, “I redeemed them,” is not bad. —4.

man I would (or used to) draw them| The figure, as Hebrew usage permits, now changes, and it goes back to that of the “team of bullocks, in charge of a kind driver. Israel are no longer the wanton young cattle of the previous chapter (10") which need the yoke firmly fastened on the neck, but a team of toiling oxen mounting some steep road.” * The driver, Yahweh, uses cords of a@ man not cords of a heifer; te. cords adapted to men, such as men could bear. — With bands of love| A parallel member interpreting O78; the first time the word “ human” is made synonymous with “ love.” + It is a tempting opportunity to suggest a gloss } snserted to make clear the difficult phrase B58 “San, but the thought may well be attributed to the prophet himself, and not to a later reader. — And [was to them as one who lifts up the yoke from upon their jaws) This continues B2Ux. The particu- Jar action here described is somewhat obscure, because of our lack of knowledge of the form of ancient yokes; but the general sense is clear. The driver so disposes the yoke as to afford relief to the animal, perhaps while eating, perhaps while resting. The singular, oO (= lift up, not take away § nor lay upon ||), is to be adopted with & and & (v.s.) instead of the plural, HAT. dy is better read Syy with &. Strangely enough, @ omits 5b, yoke.

5. He must return to the land of Egypt] Cf. 8% 9% 11%. The prophets had both Egypt and Assyria in mind as places of exile ; both powers are constantly threatening invasion ; cf. Is. at * Pre- dictions are made of restoration from both countries (cf. Is. 117 Mi. 72). The sense here is perfectly clear, whether it is obtained (1) by transferring xb =%b to the preceding verse (v.s.), or (2) by using x5 interrogatively, Shall he not return ?* but the latter is hardly consistent with the following clause. The prophet does not intend here to say that the people’s desire to be free from Assyria’s influence, and to go back to Egypt (to be in alli- ance with Egypt) is not to be realized, for this was never true

of the entire people, as this statement would indicate. Nor may we take this reference to Egypt literally, and the others, cited above, merely as types of a place of exile.* — Or Assyria will be his king| The use of x17 in this connection is difficult. Nowack suggests that it is the survival of a verbal form ; perhaps 7 (v.s.) is to be accepted. Halévy’s insertion is far wide of the mark. — For they have refused to return (to me)| The poet plays with sw ; Israel must “rn back to Egypt, because they have refused to turn (z.e. to me). » This refusal has been shown in the nation’s attitude, on the one hand towards the prophets, and on the other towards Baalism. —6. And so the sword will whirl in their cities] The 1 is consecutive ; the reference is to the coming devastation, in which the sword, the chief instrument of destruction, is represented as twisting or whirling about in their cities as a person (cf. Ez. 14” Gn. 3%).— And will destroy their branches] These words have probably crept into the text in explanation of the words in the preceding line. The word “3 has been taken of (1) dranches, the suffix referring to Ephraim, the whole being the figure of a tree (cf. 9% ™),; but this is hardly appropriate in this connec- tion; (2) great ones, princes of the land, t or his chosen ones,§ or his sons ;|| (3) hands, 6%; (4) his dars (Je. 51), z.e. the for- tresses (cf. Na. 3% Mi. 5°) which protect the land ;{ (5) Magi, i.e. false prophets.** But in view of the uncalled-for change of figure, it is better to understand 15 as a modification of "v5, and snb> of nbn, and to drop out the entire clause.ft This is in harmony with the strophic structure.— And will devour them in their for- tresses| This clause furnishes the parallel for and the sword will whirl in their cities. 1n this rendering pa™xs5 is substituted for pvmxprs, because the latter gives no satisfactory sense, or the first 2 may be attached to the preceding verb (v.s.).—7. And my people having wearied me with their rebellions, unto the yoke (i.e. captivity) Yahweh will appoint them, since he has ceased to love them] For text, v.s.

fA, Nowack says in substance: While a representation of Israel’s sin must be expected, wad oswibn makes no sense; the expression “call upward” is extraordinary in the sense of calling to repentance, and the lack of an object after nmr is unusual. With the thought of this line, cf. Is. 7%. On the reading 1487)? instead of sH¥7}', Zc. Hiph. of kap = 7p, cf. the exact equivalent in Je. 32%, “and thou causest this evil to fall upon them” ; also Nu. 35". The ‘of sm is the remnant of 817 lost because of the preceding suffix, tn with the 5 of x5 = un; for omar read a> 40 love him.* For parallel expressions, cf. 4° 9”.
V.7@ has been rendered by others as follows: (1) My people are fastened to defection (Cal.); (2) Since my people inclineth in order to fall away from me (Ew.); (3) My people is bent upon apostasy from me (Ke.; cf. AV., RV., Or.); (4) And my people is in doubt whether to turn to my law (); (5) And his people is suspended from its dwelling (G; cf. D); (6) My people is hung up; 2.e. is crucified, by the revolt from me (Oort); (7) My people is weary because of its revoltings (Oet.); (8) My people have a bias to turn from me (GAS.); (9) My people persists in its rebellion against me (Hal.); (10) And my people has joined itself to idols (Marti). V.7°° has been rendered by others as follows: (1) Upwards it is called; never- theless it striveth not upwards (Ew.); (2) One calls it to the yoke (of the law) but no one takes the yoke upon himself (Mich.); (3) They call them to him on high; no one raises up himself (Cal.); (4) And unto the Baal (cf. Sellin, Beitrage I. 306, who thinks ‘ya impossible in view of nd pp) he calls; he does not pity him at all (Ru.); (5) And unto God they call; he is angry; he pities them not (Gr.); (6) And though they (the prophets) call them upwards, none of them can lift them (GAS.); (7) To a yoke will one call (or bind) him, which no one afterwards shall take away (Oet.); (8) Unanimously they call the most high God, Lo-Yeromam, z.e. he who should not be exalted (Hal.); (9) And they all meet the Baalim (Marti, Dodekapropheton ; cf. Rel. 147, note); (10) And even if they should all together, even to the suckling, call upon him, he would not lift them up (Miller). The case is certainly a desperate one. Perhaps the suggestion given above is as satisfactory as any that has been offered,
8. How can I give thee up, O Ephraim!) Here begins the struggle in the prophet’s mind between what seems to be the demand of justice and the claim of love. The How is exclama- tory t and not interrogative;{ it carries with it the negative

force: there is no way in which I can give thee up; it is impossi- ble (cf. Gn. 39° 44° Is. 208 Ps. 137*).— How can I surrender thee, O Israel! A poetic repetition of the former line in which jxa, further defining jm:, expresses the idea of “ deliver into the hands of an enemy” (cf. Gn. 14”), a surrender (as in 3.), nota deliverance (as in © and ’A.).— How can I make thee as Admah ! How can I place thee as Zeboiim!| These cities were associated _ with Sodom and Gomorrah (cf. Gn. 1478, but the statement in that passage is probably based upon this*) ; cf. Dt. 29% Je. 49” Mt. 10% Lk. 10”; but Hosea, like the author of Dt. 29”, has sources of his own on which he draws for information concerning this catastrophe, z.e. sources other than Gn. 19 (v.z.). Amos and Isaiah use Sodom and Gomorrah in this same way (cf. Am. 4” Is. 1°* 3° 13). It is better, in accord with the parallelism, to take mmax> with what precedes than (cf. ®) with what follows. The PX is expressed only twice, viz. in the first and third lines, being omitted in the second and fourth, thus giving us a beautiful example of the elegiac measure, 3 + 2, 3 + 2.—y heart is turned upon me| This and the three lines following (vs.8”°*) are evidently late (v.s.). The thought of surrendering Ephraim produces paroxysms of sympathetic feeling in the divine breast. George Adam Smith (p. 297) says, “There follows the greatest passage in Hosea,— deepest, if not highest, of his book —the breaking forth of that exhaustless mercy of the Most High which no sin of man can bar back nor wear out.” On the phrase upon me (“v), within me, cf. 1S. 25% Je. 8%.

the most plausible, and may be adopted. —10. Yahweh will cry like a lion| This is based on Volz’s emendation,* which takes “p3, last word of v.°, and “nx, first word of v.™, with m7, reading moax> cpr. The 125° following 17 is a gloss from the hand of some one attempting to improve the passage in order to make sense of it. This roar, like that of the lion calling together its young, is the summons of Yahweh to the scattered people to return (Am. 1? 3° Je. 25”). In Is. 27% the summons is conveyed by means of a great trumpet. A different figure is employed in Ho. 5% and 13’. The remainder of v.”, together with 4, is from a later hand, explaining and amplifying the force and significance of the summons to return. The vefurn is one of the most common and significant elements in the prophets’ descriptions of the glorious future (cf. Is. 11” 27% 43° Je. 3% Am. 9% Mi. 7” Zc. 10%). As a matter of fact, "Ww, 40 growl, roar, occurs only in Je. 51%, where, as here (if this emendation is adopted), sxw is the corresponding word in the parallel line. Other treatments of these words (v.s.) are: (1) J will go, hkea lion I will roar,t joining "nx with v.®, and omitting my; (2) Yah- weh will go, like a lion he will roar; { also joining "nx to v.°. — As a lion he will roar, yea, he himself will roar, and there shall come hurriedly ...| Once more, with greater emphasis than be- fore, the thought of the summons and the return is repeated. Here emphasis is placed on the fact that Yahweh himself will send the summons, § and there will come hurriedly (i.e. eagerly, tremblingly ; cf. 3° (mB), Ps. 18% (amn)) ; who? whence? Ac- cording to fA, sons from the sea, 7.e. faithful Israelites || (or also the heathen 4) from the west (@ children of water, v.s.) ; the west being (perhaps 5% = 0° “xn, Is. 11”) “the same as ‘the islands (or coastlands) of the sea’ in the latter part of Isaiah, except that Hosea’s knowledge of the coasts and islands of the western sea would be much vaguer than that of his fellow-prophet” (Cheyne). But how can the Israelites be called 55 in this connection, and how can they come from the west when they have been repre- sented as living in Egypt and Assyria? The reading Dawn, from

their captivity,* would make good sense, but has no real basis. Perhaps it is necessary here, as in some other cases, to acknowl- edge our inability to meet the difficulties, and to leave the subject of tan untranslated.t These words have been emended variously (v.s.); eg. (1) my children from their captivity ; } (2) sons from Aram ;§ (3) sons from the nations ;\| (4) sons Srom the west and from the north; (5) my sons from the west;** (6) builders from the west. t+{ —1l. They shall come hurriedly, like sparrows, from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria] The birds represent the speed tf (cf. Ps. 55° Is. 60°) with which they come, not the timidity and faint-heartedness ; §§ ef. 77 in which the stupidity or foolishness of the dove is made a point of comparison. || || —Azd I will bring them back to ther houses | Cf. Je. 32%. This rendering {{ really represents o'm3"w instead of fA onsvin, which means J will cause them to dwell.*** — It is the declaration of Yahweh] These words are questioned by Nowack, since they occur elsewhere in Hosea only in verses that are unauthentic or suspicious (2°). The closing verses of this chapter (vs.2*9*.") are probably late,ttt because (1) they introduce an element of promise in the middle of a series of threats, there being no preparation for this word of promise and no reference to it in the following context; cf. also chap. 14, where a promise appears, although introduced in a wholly different way; (2) the expression, “I will not again destroy Ephraim,” is explicable only at a time after Ephraim has experi- enced some severe chastisement; (3) there is no connection between vs.9? 97420,

§ 16. Israel’s falsity and faithlessness from the first, in spite of efforts through prophets, must bring retribution and ruin. 12)”, [English, 11%-12¥.] Israel is false and faithless, always doing that which ends in nothing ; turning now to Assyria, now to Egypt; he must be punished; even before his birth he was a supplanter ('*?**). Israel is a trader using false balances ; rich and self-satisfied ; but his riches will count him nothing, for I will cause him to dwell again in tents (*°). Israel has been given prophets, but with no effect; lies and demon-worship prevail; bitter enmity has been aroused; sudden retribution will come upon him ; his altars shall be like stone-heaps in the furrows of Aapielde(* 27).
The patriarchal episodes in vs.13 45-7 (this is the correct order) and the historical allusions in v.24 are from a later hand, and from a different and conflicting point of view (v.z.), as compared with that of the original material. The original piece (omitting vs.) 45-7. 18. 14) consists of three very symmetrical strophes of ten lines each, in trimeter movement. The first strophe describes Israel as he is and has been from the earliest times, viz. a faithless one, a vacillating one, never knowing his mind, surely deserving punishment, since all this has been so from the life of the patriarch in his mother’s womb. The second strophe (adopting the elegiac movement 3 + 2) characterizes Israel as Canaan, a trader cheating all with whom he trades, becoming rich thereby, but destined, in spite of present riches, to dwell again in tents as in days past. The third strophe narrates the efforts put forth by prophets sent from Yahweh to teach him the right way, the lack of any results, the prevailing falseness and idolatry, the bitter enmity thus aroused, and the sudden punishment which is its consequence. Three exceedingly interesting additions have been made from the post-exilic period (1) v.!%, which includes Judah; (2) vs.*-7, which recalls certain traditions of Jacob, putting him in a most favorable light , viz, as having had intimate relationship and great influence with God; (3) on

XII. 1. The past is here, as in other discourses, uppermost in the prophet’s mind. Zphraim has compassed me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit] Yahweh is the speaker, and he speaks out of an environment made up of Ephraim’s lies, for these lies are so many as wholly to compass him about. Not infrequently has the charge been made, and with these same words, wn>d and m9 (cf. 4? 67 7'** 10*), The lies and de- ceit have to do with Yahweh, for in another strophe their cheating of each other is taken up. Israel is false to Yahweh whenever

she turns to Egypt or Assyria, just as a wife is false to her husband in joining with another man. With wna may be com- pared 75, Je. 5"; and vwe, Is. 59%; while the opposite of all these words is max. “Ephraim” and “the house of Israel” are synonymous.— And Judah is still known with God] The question is, have the words of ** a good sense, and are they then from a later hand (for no motive can be conceived for Hosea’s inserting here a eulogy of Judah) ; or have they a dad sense, and are they then really from Hosea’s own hand? fa@ bx oy 15D is difficult. The verb 1 occurs only here and in Je. 22 Gn. 27” Ps. 55°. It has been taken (1) as == bwn, rule; i.e. only Judah rules with God (= only Judah’s kings have power with God) ;* (2) Judah still serves his God; (3) with sy instead of tp and 1= ‘1, come down, Judas autem testis descenait cum deo; } (4) as = Arab. rdda = rove about, stagger, waver, hesitate, be wayward with God; } (5) as=v, so © (v.s.) =and as for Judah, God knows them now ; but as Nowack says, neither is my intelligible, nor do we expect a statement of this sort after v.1*; (6) as=um, dut Judah is still known (= betrothed, affianced) with God, which accords well with the following line;§ (7) as = rebellious;|| (8) as = 35, great; (9) but Judah walks tremblingly with God;** (10) and sill God knows them, Judah being a later addition.tt — And with the holy one faithful This seems upon the whole the most satis- factory interpretation of another difficult clause. mx) followed by ov is unknown; but cf.

This construction is preferable to (1) that which makes jax) an adjective modifying ownp tt (although this is possible if ow is regarded as an intensive plural; cf. Ps. 7! Is. 19*), because the parallelism is preserved; or (2) that which makes owp plural, and refers it to angels, saints, patriarchs, prophets, etc. ; §§ or (3) ©, which seems to have read 7x) Sx[5] mows ov (v.s.); or (4) the reading || ||

Nu. 25°* Dt. 2318 Gn. 38%” Ho, 4”). The chief grounds urged for this reading are (1) the parallelism thus secured between ** and }4; (2) the “x2 of G, which is con- sidered an intermediate form between the original sax) and jax) ; (3) the fact that 7x3 in the only other places it occurs is used of a licentious cult (Nu. 25% Ps. 106%) ; (4) in the only other passages where DWP are mentioned (1 K. 14% 15” 22% 2 K. 23’), they are connected with Judah as here. In favor of regarding 16 as late+ may be urged, therefore, (1) the favorable estimate given of Judah, which Hosea could have had ne occasion to utter ; (2) the evident interruption made by *° in the prophet’s state- ment concerning Israel, which is continued in v.?; (3) the peculiar, late usage seen in o'wsp (as plural and proper name). Other renderings based on emendations (v.s.) are: (1) and with the Holy One is not faithful; { (2) and the people of the Holy One it is called;§ (3) and with temple-prostitutes is defiled. || —2. Ephraim herds the wind, and hunts the sirocco| Ephraim is a shepherd, a hunter; but is the outcome of his occupation profitable ? His time is spent in herding—not flocks, but the wind, in hunting—not game, but the sirocco, the deadly southeast wind, which in its course destroys everything that it touches (cf. Ez. 17” Jon. 48 Ho. 13” Is. 27°). The outcome of Ephraim’s activity is, according to the figure, something ab- solutely void and empty; still more, something which is, in itself, not only useless, but fatally injurious. This use of Ap4 is bold and strong, but not too much so for Hosea; so that (1) Wellhausen’s comparison of x" (cf. Jb. 20"), seek the favor of, is unnecessary, although it is supported by the parallelism ; (2) we are reminded of the mm mw of Ecclesiastes; (3) the

Jewish interpretation, idolatry,* is too specific ; (4) “friend of the wind” + is forced; (5) there is here a touch of “ Wisdom,” but Hosea is full of wisdom-thought (v. on 14°).— Ad day long they multiply falsehood and fraud] This line explains the pre- ceding ; without cessation the activity goes on, but the result is that they increase (13% for 1 3" }) falsehood (¢.e. a false atti- tude toward Yahweh,§ not simply toward one another ||) and fraud (x being substituted for HAT aw, cf. 6 w; since “vio- lence” is not appropriate here, and the combination of falsehood and violence does not elsewhere occur ).§ — Zhey strike bargains with Assyria, and carry oil to Egypt | Here the thought of the prophet becomes still more clear and explicit. Ephraim’s activity was fruitless and injurious; it was false and deceptive; but how so? Because it involved relationship with and dependence upon other nations, and consequently acknowledgment of those nations’ gods. Of the four expressions for entering into covenant, or alliance with, m3 0°", or jm3, or ow, or m3, the latter is chosen (cf. 5 7" Is. 2°). Oil, one of the most important products of Palestine (Dt. 8° 1 K. 5" Ez. 16” 27”), was carried to Egypt, which had no oil, as a present (Is. 57°) and as an article of commerce.** Here the former is intended. Read 3” :\>ar tt instead of a :52ay. It would be difficult to find a more in- teresting parallel than is furnished for this verse in almost every particular by Is. 30% The great sin is against Yahweh, and \y consists in alliance with foreign powers, which involves distrust of and faithlessness toward Yahweh. This is seeking for wind and multiplying of falsehood. And for this reason, —3. Yahweh has a quarrel with Israel, to punish Jacob according to his ways| It is impossible ‘to suppose that Judah is here spoken of, because (1) Judah is not in the thought of the prophet here, nor often elsewhere, but v. p. clix; (2) if the text is cor- rect, Judah is given the place of prominence, even before Jacob

(Cheyne’s suggestion that Jacob is here used for Judah, as in Ps. 77", is plainly incorrect) ; (3) to accept the text is to accept the impossible combination, viz. Yahweh has a strife with Judah (even) in order to punish Jacob (for (2) © thus omits 1 with sped, and (4) if retained, it must be rendered as above unless the verse is assigned to a later period of the language, in which the construction with 5 is used to continue the ordinary imper- fect*). We must, therefore, understand that some one changed the original text, substituting Judah for Israel, perhaps when 2°, which refers to Judah, was inserted.t With the phraseology here, cf. 4 Mi. 6%. The omission of 1 before spa (cf. @ and statement above) makes the second member dependent on the first ; z.e. the purpose of the contention is to punish Israel, and this is to be measured according to his ways; i.e. in return for and in proportion to his faithless conduct toward Yahweh. The prophet desires to place special emphasis on the basis of judg- ment which Yahweh will adopt, and to that end adopts a double and striking rhetorical method of expression, repeating sub- stantially what he has just said, and then illustrating the state- ment by a significant example. This he proceeds to do in the next two members of the parallelism. {| — According to his deeds he will requite him(—4a) ; in the womb he supplanted his brother] The two clauses expressing the same thought are arranged chiastically, and are followed suddenly and strikingly by a state- ment concerning Israel’s ancestor, Jacob, handed down by tradition, which in a single stroke both announces and explains the whole case. Jacob’s supplanting of his brother in the womb before birth indicates that fatal characteristic of the nation which, as exhibited again and again in its history, has now reached the point at which punishment must be administered. This reference to traditional lore clearly carries with it reproach (cf. the unfavorable sense in which the same verb is used, Gn. 27%), and stigmatizes the nation as deceitful and untrust-

worthy. In evident contrast with this single line, the long addi- tion in vs.4* is occupied in the praise of Israel. 3» is rendered (1) “took by the heel,” on the basis of 3p mink 1™ (Gni25%), “and his hand was having hold of Esau’s heel”; (2) “sup- planted,” on basis of Gn. 27%, z.c. Jacob’s supplanting (apy) Esau twice, in the matter of the birthright and the blessing. But two things are clear: (1) there is no basis for the rendering “ took by the heel”; (2) the word jw33 used with spy indicates a source of authority distinct from the two Genesis sources.* The statement, therefore, is to be taken as an additional reproach upon Israel, and as indicating that his deceptive character is inborn and ineradicable ;* in distinction from the view which makes this clause a statement of praise uttered of the ancestor Jacob (in contrast with the degraded condition of his descendants), since, even before birth he showed his pre- éminence, how he was destined to anticipate his brother ; f for in this case the prophet would surely have designated as sub- ject of 4% the patriarch Jacob in distinction from the people Jacob; or (3) the view that this “catching hold of Esau’s heel” was presented to Israel in order to encourage and stimulate them, and to show that not merit but the mercy of God was the source of the preéminence.{ Of the three views, the first interprets the statement concerning Jacob as bad and in accord with what has been said of Israel; the second and third, as good, but as in contrast with what has been said.— 13.

contended with God 77 is also rendered “wrestled,” * “had power with.” + As the writer puts together apy’ and spy, “sup- plant,” so also Sxtw and smw, “contend.” The pun is evident (cf. Mi. 1), Note that (1) the 1 of 1x5) is a dittograph of the 1 of the preceding nx, dating, of course, from a time subse- quent to the disarrangement of the original order; (2) this line is parallel with that which follows, not with that which precedes ; (3) it is the first of four lines in close connection with each other; (4) the contest with God (or the angel), occurring on the return from being with Laban (Gn. 32”), is here placed first in order, whereas in Genesis, the Bethel story, occurring on his outward trip (v.7.) precedes; (5) whatever specific inter- pretation is adopted of these four lines, it is understood to be praise of the patriarch Jacob. On ‘ixs v2. ombx designates any form of superhuman character: (1) as here, angel; (2) dis- embodied spirits (1 S. 28%); (3) judges, as representing God (Ex. 22°°). This line praises Jacob, and is therefore incon- sistent with **; yet some make ** synonymous with 4%,¢ and understand the change to have taken place at the beginning of v°.—5.

This addition was occasioned by the fact that one of the patriarchs was represented in the original narrative in an unfavorable light, altogether at variance with the ordinary view of the patriarchs.

8. Canaan/] Strophe 2 begins in a startling fashion, with the derogatory epithet— Canaan.* The thought is a direct contin- uation of strophe 1 (7%). This strophe shows no recognition of the personal story of Jacob in vs.***%, There is no reason for supposing, as does Nowack, that after ** there originally existed a line or sentence which explained *, for “* needs no explanation ; it is on account of its perspicuity and suggestiveness that the later writer is led to give in contrast with it the interesting traditions which point to another conception of Jacob’s character. RRS follows ** most fitly. Canaan is not (1) an address, direct or indirect, to the Canaanites or Phoenicians, whose reputation for dishonesty was widely known; nor (2) a common noun, mer- chant; ~ but (3) a proper noun used as a figurative epithet for degenerate Israel, and equivalent to merchant, for the work of merchandising in the cities had been in the hands of Canaanites so long that “Canaanite” had become a synonym for “mer- chant” (Pr. 31% Jb. 41°, also Zp. 17% Ez. 17*; cf. n> = wares, Je. 10”). In the same way “Chaldean” and “ astrologer”’ became synonymous. To be rejected are (1) the making of qx an appositive of Ephraim (v.°) ;§ (2) its treatment as a vocative ; || in favor of (3) the construction as an independent nominative or accusative. — Jn his hand are false balances, he loves to defraud | Cf. Am. 2° 85%. spv (cf. **), #0 defraud, should be read {| instead of pwd, to oppress, since the latter idea is not under consideration.

The second line (two words) seems lacking in proportion, the preceding line having four words; but as suggested above, this strophe seems to have the elegiac movement (3 + 2); it is surely an elegy in its tone.—9. And does Ephraim say, Yes, but I have become rich; I have secured for myself wealth| This verse contains (1) Israel’s supposed reply to the charge of deceit and dishonesty ; together with which comes (2) Yahweh’s reply concerning the gains thus unrighteously acquired ;* and not a continued statement by Israel that his wealth will not be reckoned as sin.t Israel’s reply is of the self-congratulatory order, and furnishes his defence for this apparent dishonesty toward God and man (cf. Zc. 11°). “ex = and has Ephraim said? i.e. a con- dition (cf. Ps. 104%"). ‘8 is not asseverative = surely, indeed ; t but restrictive, and in contrast with what precedes = howdeit, still, yes, but, with something of astonishment on the part of the speaker that such charges should be made.§ Israel’s defence is twofold: (a) I am prosperous, that’s enough ; (4) I have obtained my wealth by my own efforts, and neither by the help of God || nor as a Canaanite (trafficker), cf. Zc. 147. JIN (= strength v.*) must here be taken (cf. 5'n) in sense of “ wealth” (cf. Jb. 20”) ; cf. also the reading fix, ¢do/, of D.— (Let him know) that all his gains are insufficient for the guilt which he has incurred | This ren- dering rests on @ and differs from fH@ in (a) substituting 1 (3d pers.) for ° (1st pers.) ; (4) in prefixing the preposition 5 to jin; (c) in reading xon,{ pf. 3 m. sg., for son. ‘INxm', here without the ™ (sufficiency), which is the fuller construction; cf.

(1) A promise § that they will yet be delivered out of the degraded and dishonest national life of the present into the pure, simple, and beautiful life of primitive times, before the curse of civilization had pro- duced its dire results; z.c. “although it is true that Israel has incurred condemnation, I, being the same that I have been from the beginning of their history, will deliver them, and cause them to renew their joy before me.’’ This view is supported (@) by that interpretation of “wva "> (v.z.) which makes it represent an occasion of joy; (4) by the absence of any definite reference in this verse to the wilderness ; (¢) by the actual case of the Rechab- ites, whose ideal it was thus to live apart from civilization (Je. 35°"); (@) by the fact that 11” may be interpreted consistently with this; (¢) by the combination in 2 K. 13° of the same ideas ; viz. deliverance and dwelling in tents. || (2) A threat] that they will again be driven away from home and compelled as in the days of the wilderness to live in tents ; z.¢. a wandering, nomadic life. Being the same God as of old, he will now punish as he punished in the past (Nu. 14%). This view is supported (a) by the demands of the context, for what but a threat could be uttered after the heartless and defiant words of Israel as ex- pressed in *? (4) by the analogy of 2", which is unquestionably a threat; and (c) by a correct understanding of “wv ""> (v.2.). The evidence clearly favors taking the statement thus, nor is it, as has been suggested, a threat with an indirect promise in the far distant future, an idea growing out of the analogy of the wilderness followed by deliverance ; ** or a suggestion that Yahweh “could destroy all this commercial civilization’ ; tt it is rather the plain and definite prediction, in language borrowed from past history and used figuratively, of certain destruction. — As itn the

days of the festal assembly] This phrase, in fA wi ‘HD, has received widely differing interpretations: (1) According to the appointed days, using “Wa as an appellative = an adjective.* (2) = Feast“of booths: (Lv. .23°*; cf. 1 K.-22* Dt. 31”), the time of “ingathering” (cf. Ex. 23°). The significance of this feast lay in the fact that it was an occasion of joy and thanks- giving, celebrating the completion of the harvest, and as such it was an expression of the characteristically Canaanitish idea that the deity was the lord, the da‘a/ of the land and the dispenser of its fruits. The dwelling in booths is explained by W. R. Smith as occasioned by the fear that the house and its contents should become /aéoo0 and unfit for ordinary use, through contact with the consecrated person of the worshipper during the progress of the feast ; while Wellhausen attributes it to “the custom of the whole household, old and young, going out to the vineyard in time of harvest, and there camping out in the open air under the improvised shelter of booths made with branches.” That the feast was a reminder of the tent life of early days is, of course, a late idea (P). Wellhausen’s objection that a feast character- ized by unlimited expressions of joy would not be appropriate to the wilderness is met by Cheyne’s statement that life in tents in the feast-time was a matter of amusement, out-of-door sport ; but in contrast, Israel will be compelled so to live, and this would be another matter.{ (3) A national feast, § z.e. a day of national assembling. (4) Days of appointed season, i.e. festivals (cf. 9° La. 2”), (5) Although the real wilderness-feast was the Passover (Ex. 4”), it is to be remembered that there is no reference to dwelling in tents in connection with the Passover, || and nothing is known concerning the rites of this feast. In view of the difficulties involved in the interpretation of fHI@, textual changes (v.s.) have been proposed, e.g., (1) Yet shall I bring thee back to thy God in the appointed time ;{ (2) as in the days of thy youth; ** (3) as

Wellhausen says that vs.” belong in another con- text and that there is no connection between them. The latter part of his statement is correct, the first part wrong. G. A. Smith says of vs.-, “I cannot trace the argument here.” Marti treats vs.2?-l. 13.14 as later additions. If v.” is taken as introducing a new strophe, to be followed by v.” and then by ¥ (v.” being placed before “ and v."* being regarded as a later addition from the same hand as vs.*“7), there is symmetry of artistic form, together with regular and close consecution of thought.—11l. And J spake by the prophets| As so frequently (cf. Am. 2°* Is. chap. 5) the prophet, before saying the last word, recalls the fact that earnest effort has been put forth to teach Israel the right things. This is a new thought in this piece, and quite appropriately introduces a new strophe; close connection with either '* or 10b.¢ is not to be expected (cf. on the contrary Nowack). ‘n72, perfect with waw consecutive, expresses frequently repeated action, and I used to speak.

this is just the opposite idea from that which the prophet is trying to express (cf. ™*"), and is consequently impossible. — 14. And by a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up from Egypt; and by a prophet he was shepherded | With v.” following v.™, and v." transferred to precede **, we have next v.", which is a later insertion intended to state, still more fully and definitely than Hosea had done, how Yahweh had made use of prophets in Israel’s instruction. This explains why in v." the 1st person is used, but in v.% the 3d, of Yahweh. In this verse, naturally, the idea of warning (so prominent in the original utterance) is absent. Although 8°33 is indefinite, only one prophet is in mind, Moses (cf. Dt. 18%). Nowack’s remarks (p. 76, foot) are no longer in place, because v.¥ has nothing to do with v.4. It is possible that “aw had a subject (e.g. Jacob), which has been lost; the short- ness of the line is noteworthy. For this use of “aw, cf. Is. 214 62°.—15. Lphraim has given bitter provocation] 1 gave Israel instruction and warning in every possible way (v."), and what is the result? Ephraim has, by his conduct, given me bitter provoca- tion ; literally, he has provoked bitterly, no object being expressed ; cf. 1 K. 21” 2 K. 21°.—And his bloodshed he will leave upon him] Nowack * is in error in demanding for wo) the meaning % sling, to cast down; its original use is Zo eave, let alone (cf. Ex. 234% = let the field he fallow; Nu. 11", and left (the quails) by the camp) ; so here Yahweh will leave | upon him (Ephraim) his bloodshed, z.¢. his guilt for the acts of bloodshed, of whatever form (not, however, in connection with children offered to Moloch {) which he has committed (cf. 1* 4”).§ — And his reproach his Lord will return to him| te. Yahweh will repay Israel (cf. Is. 65”) for all reproach brought upon him (Yahweh), } in 1np"an being the ob- jective genitive ; || or for the reproach of which Israel is guilty, 1 being a subjective genitive J (just as 1 in the parallel phrase 13"). —12.

is satisfactory, and the proposed change of 4 to 78 * is unneces- sary. Gilead is singled out, as in 6°, as a place in which Israel’s wickedness has especially manifested itself. ox of f@ has been taken (1) as introducing an ironical, or rhetorical, question, Js there iniquity in Gilgal ? { (2) as a particle of asseveration = surely there is wickedness in Gilgal; t (3) as a conditional particle, = if there is iniquity in Gilgal.§ —In Gilgal they sacrifice to demons | Cf.

§ 17. The utter destruction of Israel. 13%. Israel in the days of old stood high ; but they sinned and died ; and now grow worse and worse in their devotion to idols, treating them as gods (*?**) ; therefore, idolatrous through and through, they shall van- ish like cloud or dew, like chaff or smoke (°°). It was I who res- cued them from Egypt; they have had no other god or saviour. It was I who cared for them in the wilderness, but the more prosperous they became, the farther they departed from me (**°). Therefore I will destroy them as if I were a wild beast —jackal, or leopard, or bear, or lion ("*). In this impending calamity, O Israel, who will help you? There will be no king to save you; for your kings, given in my anger, will be taken away in my wrath (*”).
The unity of this passage is evident; its symmetrical structure is more than usually marked. In five strophes (8 + 6+ 8+ 6+ 8) announcement is made of absolute destruction. The movement is trimeter, with occasional dimeters and tetrameters. Strophe 1 contrasts the honored Israel of the past with the fallen Israel of the present, all on account of faithlessness to Yahweh (vs..22->), Strophe 2 presents a picture of destruction, —an utter vanishing away, consequent on Israel’s apostasy (vs.?¢3). Strophe 3 contrasts Yahweh’s love and care, as manifested in their past history, with their ungrateful atti- tude of neglect and forgetfulness in degree proportionate to the blessings - granted them (vs.4.> 6). Strophe 4 presents a second picture of destruction — a horrible devouring, as of wild beasts (vs.’.*). Strophe 5 announces sternly that no deliverance will be possible, since no leaders will remain to guide them (vs.*), No important modifications of the text are involved in this arrangement.

XII. 1. When Ephraim used to speak, men trembled | The many interpretations of this line may be classified in three lists: (1) Those which make mmm an apodosis, following the tem- poral clause expressed by an infinitive with a preposition, -« When Ephraim spoke (or used to speak, referring to the time of Ephraim’s prosperity, ¢g. in the time of the judges *), there was trembling,” ¢ ze. respect for him, reverence in his pres- ence ; cf. Is. 52%. (2) Those in which nm as an infinitive or participle (mm) is made to modify the infinitive 57 as an object or adverbial accusative, the next line serving as apodo- sis. Here belong the renderings: “When Ephraim spake stam- meringly,” { or “spake confusion, ambiguously, etc.” $ (z.e. when Jeroboam introduced the calf-worship) ; “when Ephraim spake trembling” || (z.e. humbly); “when Ephraim spake of revolt’ (¢.2. alarm, uproar, the opposite of mi>w). (3) Those in which change of text has been suggested for nnn (v.s.), eg. “judg- ment,” or “ decree,” ** “truth,” tt “knowledge,” tt “terror.” $§ Nowack’s statement that (1) is grammatically impossible, and is devoid of good meaning, is too strong.

in the glory of his past, before his fall, —a time when he needed only to speak to produce awe among his fellow-tribes, — when he stood highest in the nation, the prince. This, in the prophet’s mind, was either in the days of the judges (Ju. 8'* 12”), or in those of Jeroboam I. when the people took a retrograde step in religion; or he refers more indefinitely to the general position always occupied in the past by Ephraim, as shown in its furnishing leaders like Joshua and in its acknowledged supremacy through- out its history. — Zhen he became guilty through Baal, and died | On ovr, cf. 10% Ephraim became guilty through accepting Baal- ideas, and thus contaminating the purer form of his earlier reli- gion. This corruption came about when, giving no heed to the spiritual conceptions of the prophets, they devoted themselves to the realistic worship of Yahweh in accordance with rites borrowed from their Canaanitish neighbors (2! **). He died, to all intents and purposes, in so far as it concerned his place in the progress of religious thought (cf. Pr. 9 1 Tim. 5°). Each step in this direction was a step nearer death as a nation. Ephraim, in Hosea’s time, had been dying for a long time. The moment of actual death was now not far distant. Such was early Israel and later Israel. —2. And now they continue to sin] The Israel of the prophet’s time is no better ; they, too, sin; in fact, they continue to sin; they keep up the national retrogression. And then the prophet gives in detail the several actions which constitute this sin. Two quite distinct cults are here treated as one, the Baal- cult and the image-cult.— And they make for themselves molten gods from their silver] As early as in the smaller book of the Covenant (Ex. 34"”) there had been prohibition of the “molten gods.” In Isaiah’s time (2°) the land came to be full of idols, and, in the later days of Isaiah, Hezekiah (2 K. 18*) undertook to root them out. The history of the relation of the prophets and sages to the image worship is a most interesting one. This pas- sage is one of the earliest in the long list of such utterances.* It is always to be remembered that the stage of image worship in

the development of religion is a late one. With the attitude of the Hebrew prophets towards image worship, and the actual historical results of that attitude, may be compared the similar attitude of the earliest Greek philosophers, together with the lack of any such results.* — Jdols according to their own model| Read- ing onsven>. fT “ understanding,” if retained, must be under- stood as used sarcastically. &, “according to their figure,” and GT favor the rendering adopted above.

What, indeed, could be more heinous?

certainly as much as for the many efforts hitherto made to meet the difficulties in this passage. Some of these are: (1) “ they say to one another, sacrificers of men, let them kiss, etc. ;” * ze. the absurdity of sacrificing men and worshipping calves is derided. (2) “Those among men who sacrifice, let them kiss the calves,” t this construction being similar to that found in Is. 29” Jb. 317 Mi. 5° 1 K.19%. In the latter case, the emphasis rests upon the absurdity involved in human beings paying homage to calves. Ewald’s con- nection of these words with those preceding is interesting ; viz. 0 even these speak men who, etc. ; cf. also Keil’s discussion. Con- cerning the first of these general interpretations, it is to be said that (a) calf-worship and human sacrifice were never combined ; (6) human sacrifice did not exist in Israel until much later than Hosea’s time, { viz. that of Ahaz; (c) this erroneous interpretation originated with G, and has influenced commentators up to modern times; (@) the prophet would hardly have treated human sacri- fice in such a fashion. Concerning the second interpretation, it is to be said that (a) the passages cited are not satisfactory analogies, and (4) the awkwardness of the expression, thus inter- preted, is very great.§ Concerning both interpretations, it may be said that (a) no adequate sense is conveyed; (4) the paral- lelism, elsewhere scrupulously observed, is ignored; (¢) the de- mands of the strophic structure are not met (cf. Ruben and Duhm ; z.s.).|| — With men kissing calves| A second circumstan- tial clause strictly parallel with the preceding one. For various interpretations, v.s. The diss was a token of homage or adora- tion, and is referred to in the case of kings (Ps. 2), and, as here, idols (1 K. 198 Jb. 317).

this is no ground for omitting it here, as is done by Nowack. The quadruple figure (cf. the following) is very striking. These lines, moreover, are demanded to complete the structure of the strophe.— Like the chaff which whirleth up from the threshing- floor) Cf. Is. 17 41%* Ps, 14. The threshing-floor was usually situated on an eminence which the wind would easily strike (cf. 1S. 19” (G) 2S. 24% 2 Ch. 32).* The active form, fAT aver, is satisfactory, and need not be changed to the passive (v.s.). —And like smoke from the window | 378, used of the win- dows of heaven, whence comes rain (Gn. 7% 2 K. 7?)9 Mal. 3°); occurs also of the openings of a dove-cote (Is. 60%), of the eyes (Ec. 12°) ; and here, of the /aticed opening or window through which smoke escapes. The comparison is not found elsewhere. The strophe, as a whole, is very strong. This people, sacrificing to demons and kissing calves, shall become nothing, just like the cloud, the dew, the chaff, and the smoke. —4. And it was L, the Lord thy God, who brought thee up from the land of Egypt) te. 1 do not forget, in thus threatening total extinction, that it was I who brought them into existence as a nation.

G inserts much additional material after thy God (v.s.).— And a god besides me thou knowest not| Cf. Dt. 32”. The meaning becomes clearer from the parallel line; it is God as saviour, deliverer, that is meant; 7.¢. Israel has received no favors from any other god. It may not be assumed that Hosea believed in the existence of only one God. At all events, this expression does not show this. He says, however, that no other god has exerted his power on behalf of Israel. — Wor has there been a saviour except me] A poetic parallel of the preceding line. — 5.

(But) when they fed, they filled themselves full | This reading connects paw (for wwaw) with the preceding verb, as a strengthening infinitive absolute. So bounteous was the supply furnished that Israel, although filling himself to the full, failed to recognize the source of the supply (2° 47 101; cf. Dt. gut 21% 32%18), This is expressed most pathetically in the next line: And their heart was lifted up; con- sequently they forgot me] The history is thus epitomized of the evil results which often flow from prosperity .* cf 84s. 29% 4.

This reading is gained by two slight changes in the text (v.s.). JINMw may be pointed so as to be read as perfect 3d masc. “he has destroyed thee”; * or perfect rst sg. “I have destroyed thee,” or “‘T destroy thee.” It has also been taken as a noun with 2d person suffix “ thy destruction = thou hast destroyed thyself,” t or with the following "> as a remnant of ">9% (cf. Nowack), “I am thy destruction.” Still another group of interpreters have made the following clause the subject ;§ viz. “it has destroyed thee, that (thou art) against me, etc.’’ (v.z.)._ According to Kimchi it is the calf which has wrought the destruction. Upon the whole, the 1st person is to be preferred as continuing the person already in use. The perfect is prophetic. The logical relationship of this clause is thus clear: when I destroy thee, as I am now about to do, who then is to be thy help? (™ for "3; u.s.). ‘> may be taken (v.s.) for "38, or as the particle of asseveration, yea, then ; @ and & are so clear on this reading that we may not doubt it.| Oettli’s pointing Fb, “thy helper,” does not affect the sense. 3 = “in the capacity of” or “in the character of,” the so-called 5 essentiae.§ Ewald’s translation, “that (thou) to me, (ze. to thy help !) becomest unfaithful” (these last words to be supplied, the abruptness being attributed to the “laboring voice, interrupted by sobs’’), is an interesting but ineffectual effort toward the recon- struction of this sentence. The verse, as read above, is strictly in accord with the context. Who is to help thee ? (cf. Ex. 18': for the God of my father was my help, lit. was 7” or as my help). No one.—10.

§ 18. Ephraim condemned to Sheol. 13!% Ephraim’s sin is complete ; judgment approaches, but he is unprepared; he cannot escape from the calamity which is bearing down upon him. Shall I, now, rescue him from this certain death? No! it is too late ; let Sheol’s plagues attack him. I will no more show com- passion. To Ephraim, although heretofore fruitful, an east wind will bring drought and death ; all precious things shall be carried away by the foreign invader. Samaria must suffer the conse- quences of rebellion against Yahweh, viz., sword and_ horrible destruction.
This section bears all the marks of unity, and is taken as a separate address by many modern commentators (eg. We., Now., Marti). Some, on the other hand, connect it closely with 13! (Ew., Or., Che., GAS.). It is true the general subject is the same, but, after all, this is the subject of the greater portion of the book. There are four strophes of trimeter movement, with 6+5+6-+5 lines, The elegiac measure is strongly marked; while in strophe 4 the dimeter is adopted for the purpose of adaptation to the terrible content of the poem. Strophe 1 announces the end, the judgment, and the collapse of Israel. Strophe 2 pictures a momentary reconsideration, which results in a reannouncement more direful than before. Strophe 3 puts the matter in a more exact form, destruction by drought, by foreign invasion. Strophe 4 explains that it is on account of Israel’s sin, viz. rebellion, that the sword and war will blot them out of existence.

12. The iniquity of Ephraim is gathered up; his sin ts laid by in store| This is no word of promise = shall be forgotten ;* the context and the language itself indicate the opposite. The figure (cf. Jb. 14”) is taken from the custom of tying up money in bags and hiding it in some secret place for preservation. Ephraim’s guilt is collected, carefully bound up ; it will be well guarded and preserved, and no part of it will be lost sight of in the day of judgment. In other words, the case is closed. No longer is there opportunity to atone for their misdeeds. Cf. the noteworthy parallel in Is. 8", where, however, it is the teaching of Yahweh, the testimony of the prophets, that is gathered up.

Mi. 4° Je. 4" 13”) ; the pain and suffering of a woman in travail is a most striking representation of an inevitable period of afflic- tion, since it is something which no power can turn aside. In this instance the figure represents the woman as unable to perform the act ; ze. Israel is unable to extricate himself from the troubles which have come upon him. But with the privilege of a Hebrew poet, the figure suddenly shifts from the mother to the child that is to be born. — He is an unwise son] This child is represented as failing to do the part assigned him by nature; and in this failure he shows himself unwise and foolish. The result will be that, instead of an occasion for rejoicing, viz. a new birth, there will rather be an occasion for grief, for the parturition will be fatal to both mother and son. Not only is there no new being in the world ; that one which did exist is taken away. Israel, in order to continue life, must be born again; without such new birth, old Israel must perish. The very failure to produce the new destroys the old. This is explained in the following line. — For at this Hime he should not stand in the mouth of the womb, or more freely, this ts no time to stand in the mouth of the womb*] Whether may be read,t or my> = “at this time,” the meaning is not affected. Graetz’s “do not break through (the womb)” affords no real help in the interpretation of the passage. The exact meaning rests upon the modal usage of sy". If it is indicative, it signifies that the child at the (right) time (cf. Ez. 27%) does not stand, t z.¢. has not come forward to that place in the womb whence egress at the proper moment is possible ; if it is optative, that the child should not (at this time, or now) remain stationary in the womb, thus failing to make the progress necessary to a normal birth.§ What is Israel doing? By his lack of will-power or inclination to do the necessary thing, viz. make timely repentance, he prolongs the agony and endangers even the possibility of the new régime which the prophets have pictured and promised. The figure has been interpreted of (1) premature birth; 7.2. a child who is impatient and waits not for the proper time, thus remain- ing in the womb an insufficient period ; and this is coupled with the interpretation of the passage as one of comfort ;| (2) retarded

It seems necessary, first of all, to determine what is required by the context,—a promise { or a threat? Ves seem (v.5.) to announce punishment ; vs.’**"*”° certainly have this meaning ; v."* itself contains (v.7.) the statement repentance (not resentment) is hid from my eyes. How now can Ma be taken in - any other way than as a threat? But it has been suggested (1) that the simple translation is “From the hand of Sheol, I will redeem them,” there being no interrogative particle ; and (2) that this translation is strictly in accord with the feeling of a father who is thus represented as unable to contemplate the thought of his son’s final ruin; (3) that it is also consonant with Hosea’s expression of ultimate redemption elsewhere, cf. 1°* 2% 3° 148; (4) still further, that the language has been so taken by @SYT, by Paul in 1 Cor. 15%; AV. and RV. In this case, “repentance” (v.7.) must be changed to “resentment,” and the words treated parenthetically, zc. “as an ejaculation of promise in the midst of a context that only threatens.” The argument is almost if not entirely conclusive on the side of those who treat the entire verse as a threat. But from this point of view, different treatments have been accorded the passage: (1) (making the imperfect a frequentative) “I have in past times repeatedly delivered them, but, etc.” ;§ (2) (making the imperfect condi- tional) “I would have delivered them, etc. (if they had been wise, but — being foolish —) I will bring on them the plagues of death, etc.”;|| (3) (treating the sentence as interrogative, as above) “shall I, or should I deliver them, etc.,” J a negative answer being implied. The “hand of Sheol” (cf. the “mouth,” Is. 5%, the “belly,” Jon. 2”) is here used poetically for “power,” and perhaps to give the line a third word. .Sheo/ = underworld. — Shall I redeem them from death ?| The poetic equivalent of the preceding line; on the synonyms 5x) and ma, v.2.; on the synonymous use of “Sheol” and “death,” cf. Is. 28” Ps. 6° 49™. — Where are thy plagues, O death? Where, thy destruction (or

pestilence), O Sheol ?| "8 = m8, where ?* So rendered by many, who treat it in entirely opposite ways; ¢.g. (1) as an expression of triumph over Sheol and death, their plagues and pestilence being powerless to do harm, inasmuch as Yahweh has determined to deliver Israel; and (2) as a command to Sheol and death to do their worst, z.e. to bring on plagues and the pestilence which shall destroy Israel = “ come on, death, with thy plagues, and thou, O Sheol, with, etc.” { Others (reading ‘78 as 1st singular imper- fect apocopated of mm) render J zl be,§ or J would be; || but (1) the rst person singular is rarely apocopated; (2) if Yahweh asserts positively that he will deliver them from Sheol, this clause must mean, J would be thy plagues, if it were necessary, but the con- text seems to require a positive declaration. Whether we read pestilence as singular or plural is unessential (v.s.). Everything that points toward death (mille viae leti) is to be reckoned a pestilence ; while 402 (v.2.) = destruction in general (Is. 28°) ; in particular, epidemic, disease, plague (cf. Dt. 32% Ps. 91°). — Repentance is hid from my eyes| For this reason, Yahweh, having determined not to deliver, calls upon Sheol to do its fatal work. Dm, occurring only here, has been emended to a form of ona = compassion. Ewald, on the basis of Gn. 27” (“thy brother re- sents thee unto death”’), translates resentment, t.e. a secret, treas- ured, ancient grudge, which will result in the death of an enemy ; and this is something which God himself will not permit. But the word means neither resentment nor compassion.** It is the tech- nical word for repentance. It refers therefore, either (1) to the threat of v.”, tf of which Cheyne suggests it may once have been the third member, but surely in its present position it could not go so far back ; or (2) to ** taken as a promise, tf ze. a promise which should never be repented of = irrevocable ; but the prom- ise is regarded, even by those who so accept it, as of so transient a tone as to make this doubtful; or (3) to “* taken as a threat, §§

Although he, as does the reed-grass in the midst of water, show fruitfulness| A pun on the word 5B™5x, cf. also 148 Gn. 49”, and Ewald’s rendering, “ though he be among brothers a fruit-child.” His name (for name = nature or character) would have given ground for the expectation of fruit- fulness; i.¢. prosperity. The reading adopted (v.s.) is favored by the continuation of the same figure in v.%. It would have seemed impossible that there could have been disaster with every- thing so prosperously situated (for the reed-plant in the midst of the water,* cf. Gn. 417 Is. 19°). As fatal to HAT + is the fact that Ephraim cannot be taken as one tribe among its brethren the other tribes, because clearly it is used here, as elsewhere, of all the northern tribes. {— Zhere shall come an east wind, — Yahweh's wind | This wind, coming over the desert, is both violent and scorching (cf. Arab. Sirocco = Eastern) ; cf. (with min) Ex. ro Jon. 4° Ps. 48’; as here, standing alone, Ho. 12* Is. 278, etc. The figure represents Assyria, who comes from this direction, cf. Is. 211. It is Yahweh’s wind, because it is Yahweh himself who executes the judgment pronounced, Assyria being the instrument (cf. Is. 10) § ; or because it is a mighty wind, in- tensity being expressed by the use of the divine name (cf. Gn. 23° Is. 14% Ps. 36°).|| “mm is thus to be taken as in apposition with pip, and so as closely connected with it, and not as subject of mbv.— Coming up from the wilderness] v.s.— And his fountain shall dry up, and his spring shall be parched ] A continuation of the figure in %*, the source of fruitfulness will be destroyed.

§ 19. Later words of hope. 147%. Israel will return from her apostasy with words of true repentance (+22), saying to Yah- weh, “Forgive the past, and we will render praise and thanks- giving, for in thee the fatherless finds pity (?*%°). We will henceforth enter into no alliance with Assyria or Egypt; nor will we treat as God dumb idols” (°°). (Yahweh will reply) “TJ will forgive the past, and love them ; instead of being angry with them, I will show mercy (*°*). As a result they shall flourish; their prosperity shall be like the olive, like Lebanon” (6), “Ephraim will no longer serve idols; it is I who will care for him eternally and sustainingly” (°).
This piece, a picture of the final triumph of Yahweh’s love, is added in accordance with the prophetic thought of a much later period. Cf. §5, pp. 236-248, and also Introduction, pp. clix ff. Six short strophes of the trime- ter movement (exceedingly regular) are evenly divided: between Israel and Yahweh in their loving discourse with each other. Strophe I announces the return, in the form of command, and prescribes the gift which they are to carry (vs.234), Strophe 2 presents the petition for forgiveness and the ground for the same (vs.3% 4°). Strophe 3 contains the pledge given, never again to desert Yahweh for dependence on outside powers or on graven images (v.42), Strophe 4 announces in reply Yahweh’s readiness to for- give, to forget, and to be merciful (vs.5-64), Strophe 5 pictures their great prosperity now that they are loyal to Yahweh (vs.6>-7). Strophe 6 asserts that henceforth Yahweh, not idols, shall be their everlasting support (v.°). If it were not so clear that each of these four-line strophes contained a separate and distinct thought, it might be well to arrange the piece in two strophes of twelve lines each. In this arrangement, the following general modifica- tions of the text have been assumed: (1) the transfer of v.*¢ to follow v.® (v.i.); (2) the omission of v.’ «* as a gloss (v.i.); (3) the treatment of v8 as a later addition. There has been a growing tendency on the part of the most recent writers to deal with this passage (vs.2%) as with Am. 98°), i.e. assign it to a later age than that of Hosea (so We.; Che. in WRS. Proph. XIX. and in Exp. Nov.’97, p- 363; Marti, Rel. 119, EB. 2122, and Dodekapropheton ; Volz(?); Grimm, Zit. App. 91 ff.; on contrary, v. GAS. I. 309 ff.; Now.). In behalf of this position it may be urged (1) that there is total lack of connec- tion between vs.1942; (2) that “to have added anything to the stern warning of 141 would have robbed it of half its force” (Che.); (3) that 2%, in contrast with 55, looks back upon the punishment as completed; (4) that the allusion
XIV, 1-8 409
to a covenant with Egypt (v.*) is incomprehensible in Hosea’s time; (5) that Hosea certainly could not have spoken of Yahweh’s wrath as having departed from Israel; (6) that the spiritual tone of vs.2 is in striking contrast with the picture in 5°; (7) that the emphasis laid upon physical blessings (vs.6#-) is strange on the lips of Hosea, who constantly rebuked the Israelites for their longing after material blessings rather than ethical and spiritual ; (8) that the “whole description is wanting in unity; entirely different features are simply combined one with another” (Grimm); (9) that the language and phraseology are very similar to those found in writings from the time of Jeremiah and later (on language, v. especially Volz and Grimm) ; (10) that the emphasis here laid upon woras is in striking contrast with Hosea’s demand for deeds. On the other hand, it is claimed (see especially GAS.), (1) that Hosea must have given utterance to such a hope as is here set forth, his point of view being different from that of Amos, in that he was of an affectionate disposition, and utterly unable to believe repentance impossi- ble, and had indeed already predicted restoration on the basis of repentance (chap. 2); but cf. pp. 236, 238; (2) that the epilogue introduces no idea which was not already contained in the previous promises of the book; “there is, in short, no phrase or allusion of which we can say that it is alien to the prophet’s style or environment, while the very key-notes of his book — return, backslid- ing, idols — the work of our hands, such pity as a father hath, and perhaps even the answer or converse of v.2—are all struck once more”’ (GAS.); (3) the similarity between the epilogue and such passages as Je. 311-20 is to be explained as due to the influence of Hosea on later writers; (4) while it is unlikely that Hosea’s ministry closed with this word of promise at a time so close to the downfall of Northern Israel, it is probable that it comes from some earlier portion of his career, when the moral failure of Israel was not so clear, and the outlook still furnished occasion for hope. The present position in the book, it is suggested, is due to Hosea or some editor who thought it unfitting that the prophet’s message should go down through the ages closing with a threat of punishment. But the weakness of the old position is seen in the unreadiness of those who hold it to permit this chapter to stand at the end of the book.

1. Return, Israel, to Vahweh thy God\ The introductory words of the utterance. The imperative is predictive (cf. Tscia3tayt) = the time will come when thou shalt return. For the consist- ency of this prediction with the announcement to the effect that
XIV. 1-2 AII
there was absolutely no hope, reference is made to (1) other similar passages, viz. 19-2! 2 314 1350 but these are mostly late; (2) the suggestion that while the passages without hope applied to the nation as such, such expressions as these were addressed to the faithful few ; (3) the proposition that in all pre- dictions of disaster there is a conditional element (ch Je, 18%) 5 but these are not sufficient to overcome the difficulties suggested above. Israel’s apostasy was the cause of the whole trouble (cf. Je. 2”); his return is the first step to be taken toward reconciliation. — For thou hast stumbled by thine iniguity| Cf. 4° 5°. Israel’s iniquity (crookedness) occasioned the fall; for the calamity has already come (cf. 5'3* 7*).—2. Take with you words and return unto Yahweh your God] The last two words are found in © and 8, and are required by the measure. Words (not my words (v.s.), nor Yahweh’s words,* for (2) in this case something more definite would be required, and (4) this would not be consistent with the following lines; nor words which are to be taken to heart f) are to be the gift carried to Yahweh, for (Ex. 23% 34”) none shall appear before Yahweh empty ; words, rather than sacrifice and burnt offering (cf. 5°). These words must express repentance, not fitful, but true and strong. { — Say unto him: Do thou wholly remove (i.e. forgive) iniquity] The prayer begins with petition for pardon. The emphatic 55 used adverbially (cf. 2 S. 1° Jb. 27%) describes the pardon called for as one entirely complete; vi. Oort’s emendation (v.s.), “thou art able to forgive,” is very ingenious, but z. Nowack; cf. also Graetz, “Wilt thou not forgive?” — And do thou take good | 7c. take it well§ that we pay, etc.; or accept what is good, viz. that we pay, etc. ;|| or graciously receive (us) ; 4 or let thyself be gracious ;** or take good things ++ (cf Ps, 167° Pr. 437 Is. 55%), Graetz’s suggestion (v.s.) means nothing ; but Oort’s, “and let us receive good,” furnishes a good meaning. © and & have the imperative 2d person plural “take ye,” but this is inconsistent with what follows. — And we will pay the fruit of our lips] i.e. if thou wilt forgive, etc., we will pay, etc. ; or do thou forgive, etc.,

that we may pay, etc. f#@ “We will pay the calves of our lips” * is ungrammatical and senseless ; it is hardly any improve- ment to render “we will pay (as if with) bullocks, (with) our lips." + Cf. Hitzig’s rendering (v.2.), “ thoughtless utterances re (Je. 5”). It is impossible to find any satisfactory treatment of np ; nor is it necessary when @’s suggestion of "p is so close zt cf. Is. 57%. The fruit of the lips is, of course, the words spoken in praise and thanksgiving (Ps. BI Og ye oe now, cf. Ps. 50". 3c. Forin thee the orphan finds mercy (or pity)| This line stands better here, because (1) 42 has nothing in v.2 to which it may refer, while here it connects closely with the 2d person of the verbs xwn and mp; (2) it explains here the ground of their praise and thanksgiving, viz. for mercy shown, while with v.°*? it makes no logical connection; (3) in its position in HAG it has nothing with which it stands in parallelism, and it interferes with the strophic structure, while in the position here suggested it not only relieves strophe 3, but completes strophe 2, which other- wise would be incomplete. Zhe orphan is “ das von Menschen verlassene, rein auf Yahweh angewiesene Israel” (Wellhausen) ; cf. Jn. 14%.—3 a.b. Assyria shall not save us| A pledge to give up looking for help toward Assyria (cf. 5% 7% 8°).— We will not vide upon horses (from Egypt)| A second pledge to leave off trusting in Egypt, for alliance with Egypt included the provision of cavalry by Egypt (cf. 1” 10% with Is. 30% 311). From the times of Solomon horses were brought into Palestine from Egypt (1 K. 10% Ez. 17”). See the prohibition in Dt. 17°.— And we will no more say: “ Our God,” to the work of our hands Cf. 13°. This is the third pledge, viz. not to treat as God images which were made by themselves. This is the climax of the pledge. With these three points covered, Israel will be at one with Yah- weh. The chief planks in the platforms of both political parties of earlier times are here rejected. In the phrase, “ work of our hands,” is seen an example “of the splendid morsels of irony in which” later prophecy “lashes idolatry” (cf. Is. 42" 44°”). § — 4.

introduce a different speaker, the context leaves us in no doubt. Yahweh in his turn replies not directly to them, but in an indirect way, as if speaking to the prophet concerning them; cf. rr’. Their apostasy, or backsliding, is regarded as a disease, which will be healed. — 7 wild love them Jreely] z.e. of my own free will; because of that which is in me, not because of anything in them. This is added as a poetic parallel to the preceding, and is gram- matically independent. — Since (= now that) my anger is turned away from them] The pronoun is 3d singular, z.e. collective. The Babylonian Codex has from me, a mistake growing out of Je. 2°. ‘3 furnishes the ground for what follows in 5@, not what precedes. This connection of 4° with °¢ is clearly shown by the parallelism. It is only in ** and following that the subject changes from Yahweh to Israel. For other cases in which "> (= Gru), with its explicative clause, precedes the clause explained, cf. Gn. K penal take Ex. 1” 18" 2 S. 19” Is: 28". — 5. 2 will be as the dew unto 4srael] The dew is here a figure of beneficence, kindness ; cf. its very different force in 64. 5» = night-mist or vapor, which comes in the summer with the west wind.

It is therefore best to regard it as an interpolation by a still later hand, { and to suppose that it was intended to be the utterance of the pro- phetic writer, not of Yahweh. The text is difficult.

With this translation may be compared (1) they shall revive (as) the corn; ** (2) bring corn to lifett (cf. the statement in a), neither of which seems satisfactory. — And they will sprout hike the vine| The vine is frequently mentioned in figurative speech ; e.g. 10! Ps, 80% 128° Ct. 7° Is. 34! Je. 27 69 Ez. 17.— And their renown will be like the wine of Lebanon] Ct. 1°; cf. also nm of preceding verse, and Ho. 12°, Contrary to Nowack’s @ priori sug- gestion that good wine could not be produced so far north, cf. the testimony of von Troil (cited by Henderson), “ On this mountain are very valuable vineyards, in which the most excellent wine is produced, such as I have never drunk in any country, though in the course of fourteen years I have travelled through many, and tasted many good wines.” {{ Perhaps 31 should be read with G. A. Smith, m1, and in the sense given this word in Is. 66°, they shall be fragrant; cf. 6.—8. Ephraim, what more has he to do with idols| Yahweh speaks here.

cf. 2". Yahweh now replies or gives response to Israel in the same temper as that with which Israel met Yahweh, and besides, he looks upon him for the purpose of rendering assistance (Ps. 84° 119 Jb. 33"), ze. he looks after his needs. Cf. the opposite, “to hide his face,” Dt. 31. Wellhausen’s “his Anath and Asherah” is a freak of the imagination. Volz’s “I answered him with wine and corn” is better, but not strong. —J am like an evergreen cypress| It is difficult to read this of Yahweh, but it is still more difficult to place it in Israel’s mouth. In favor of the former * is the fact that it is demanded by the following clause of which Yahweh is certainly the subject. Yahweh’s shelter and protection of his people are likened to the refreshing shade of the cypress. If the words be referred to Israel, there is the difficulty that Israel is likened in two successive clauses to two different kinds of tree, for the cypress is not a fruit tree. As opposed to this, and in favor of the latter,t is the fact that Yahweh is nowhere else likened to a tree. If the figure is used of Israel, the punctuation of f@ must be disregarded, and this clause be taken with wwwsxi= and J lok after him like an evergreen cypress. With all its difficulty, the former is to be preferred.— From me ts thy fruit found | This is clearly in Yah- weh’s mouth, and announces, as the last word of the dialogue, that from Yahweh comes all of Israel’s prosperity.

§ 20. The lesson to be learned. 14°. A man who desires wisdom will study such things as these that are found in Hosea’s prophecy. It will be seen from these chapters that Yahweh's ways are straight, and that by them men stand or fall.
In a five-line stanza (trimeter movement), a reader from a late period adds his own understanding or interpretation of Hosea’s writings as a whole. Two elements in the verse betoken the lateness of the conception, viz. the strong coloring of the wisdom-speech, and the division of humanity into two classes, viz. the righteous and transgressors; cf. Pr. 115 151%; also Ecclus. 39%.

9. Whoso is wise, let him discern these things| Here “» is used indefinitely, in the sense of whoever, or if any one. The words wise (DDN) and discern (p3) are technical terms of the wisdom- vocabulary ; ¢hese things means, of course, the preceding dis- courses of the prophet Hosea. The reader’s advice is this: Notice how things work out in history, as in the case of Israel, and acquiesce therein ; for to do this is a mark of “ wisdom.” — Pru- dent, then let him know them] A parallel statement, reénforcing what has just been said, expressed likewise in wisdom-language (cf. 33, from Pp (v.s.), and pv, which might mean here either acknowledge, confess (as in Je. 3% Is. 59” Ps. 51°) or observe, per- ceive, te. secure the lessons of wisdom they were intended to teach; cf. the absolute use of yt de wise, in Is. 1°, and its use with mon in Pr. 24%).— For Yahweh's ways are straight] *3 = for, not that. The word Providence would, perhaps, suitably represent the frequently recurring phrase, Yahweh's ways, which includes the ways in which he acts, as well as those in which men, under his guidance, move. The reference is to Hosea’s interpre- tation of these ways. Yahweh’s dealings put men on straight (t.e. not crooked, but lying in an unbroken level ; cf. Is. 26*) or right (é.e. righteous) ways ; cf. Dt. 32‘ Ps. 19°. — Zhe righteous walking
XIV. 9 417
in them] This word righteous (ap) is not used elsewhere in Hosea. This is not explained by the fact that there were none such in his days,* but is due to the fact that this technical phrase had not yet come into use. ‘The clause is subordinate to the preceding, not coordinate f with it. To walk in Yahweh's ways is to adopt a course of conduct in harmony with Yahweh’s will, and consequently one which permits them to go forward prosperously. — But sinners stumbling by them] That is, they fall and suffer utter ruin. The same ways lead in one case to life, but in the other to death ; cf. Dt. 30” 1 Cor. 18

The two clauses at the end of the verse are closely parallel, and should be taken together, both being subordinate to the preceding; vs. ;
